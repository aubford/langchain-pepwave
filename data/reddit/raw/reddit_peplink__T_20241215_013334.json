I figure the speedfusion vpn should be around 350MB if i do not use encryption.\n\nMy question is if this is viable, or can you suggest something better?\n\nI run a 10g network internally, so I have to keep the unifi gateway in place since it handles layer 3 for my network.\n\nthanks!",

My understanding is that the BR1 Pro 5g can simultaneously use WiFi WAN (e.g. use the RV park's WiFi as uplink) while acting as a WiFi AP providing WiFi to the clients inside my RV. But if I connect the WiFi antenna ports on the BR1 Pro 5g to the Mobility 42G antenna to be installed on the roof of the RV wouldn't that impair the connectivity to the devices inside the RV? Alternatively, I could use the external antenna for cellular only and use the included indoor antennas for WiFi but wouldn't that impair the connection to the upstream WiFi AP?\n\nIdeally I would use an external antenna for WiFi WAN and an internal antenna for the WiFi AP but it seems this isn't how it works with this or any of Peplink's products. Am I missing something here, or am I overthinking it? How do other's setup with external antennas look like?",

I was looking for a higher gain antenna we could use.  I had looked at the mobility 82g and a few of the other ones offered by peplink but i'm at a bit of a loss.  I'd like something that would work as a general-purpose solution to get improved reception in challenging environments.

    "page_content": "Hi -\n\nWe're going to be exhibiting at the Las Vegas Convention Center at a huge event (SEMA). There will be 2 or 3 laptops doing web stuff plus a few tablets (for scanning badges) active at any time. No streaming video, but the web side of things needs to be responsive as we're demonstrating our software through it.\n\nLast year one of our people brought some form of Verizon Jetpack. I'm guessing it was 4G. Internet connectivity was useless through it. And before people ask why we don't just buy Internet through the event, a 3Mbps connection is $3,500 - and prices just skyrocket from there. They have cheaper shared connections ($995 for a 10Mbps connection) but they specifically say that routers and NAT devices are not allowed for shared bandwidth connections. If we get caught doing this then we might lose Internet for the entire event.\n\nSo... I'm looking at the BR1 Mini 5G and the B One 5G. With the BR1 Mini we would need to add an access point (I know we could get the max but for $500 extra and we're on a budget). I believe we can use a Peplink eSim for either device in order to get multi-carrier capability (if one carrier gets slow during the show).\n\nFor the BE1 Mini 5G, the 5G connection is primary so I'm assuming the OS and hardware has been optimized to get the best efficiency on 5G. For the B One 5G, the 5G is considered a backup connection.\n\nWe'd also like to make sure we can configure/manage/upgrade the device locally via web or SSH without having to buy something like Primecare every year or two.\n\nSo I guess the questions I have are:\n\n1. Which device do you think would be better for this? The BR1 Mini 5G with an access point, or the B One 5G?\n2. Can the B One 5G use the Peplink eSim?\n3. Do we have to buy Primecare for each of these units in order to configure/manage them locally? What do we lose in functionality if we don't have Primecare?\n4. Will the B One 5G be good with just the cell side active + client WiFi?\n\nThanks!",

It has served us well for years. We like peplink, we love the features, and its been very reliable, (think we started using Peplink since 2019)\n\nWe are growing rapidly, as due to us spending money and getting good reliable equipment even for small businesses and it working very well that we rarely have trouble tickets, and single tech can manage 1000s of devices (we do just about anything tech related, and really worked on workflows and automation, taking advantage of API's and making scripts to detect and mediate), its been good.\n\nHowever we are going more advanced networking for larger organizations that do have 100-200 PC's, and have hundred employees, and do need more security and options. And some have their own inhouse tech that can handle the day to day (Password resets, and replacing parts or keyboard/mouse or PC's), while we handle the more complex systems and components.\n\nAlso as Fiber is becoming more readily available and affordable, or Coaxal Hybrid, we were lucky that Peplink released Peplink B One series, that made great value product that has 1gig throughput, so we can continue affording to put Peplink for small businesses, and eat the cost while not raising prices for our new small business clients.\n\n  \n**Getting to the point:**\n\nWe have purchased new Peplink Balance two about 1-2 maybe 3 years back (with Coivd, the last few years feel like they don't really exist), we saw RADIUS and LDAP Authentication for VPN, something we wanted to start implementing (Whole remote work from home), along with support 1gig throughput, which we started having clients and ourselves starting to get faster speeds then the 600mbps that many lower end Peplinks supported. I think we tried to figure it out, but ended up setting up RDP Gateway for most clients (with Duo 2FA) and going that route. (will get back to this in a bit)\n\n  \nJumping to Now, we got the Peplink B One, for client, and they have about 80 or so Employees, and have Fortinet, we would like to swap for Peplink, (to use bonding), and its a great value and looking on Datasheet, did everything we need it to, and already have it for many other clients and great little product, we love it! Plus we have API Built out and whole map our tech built that shows shows Peplink devices and has different color dots (green if all good, and other colors if something is wrong or detected that needs attention), very cool.\n\nSo they have Fortinet with Active Directory connected VPN, so users can remote in using their regular credentials, which we saw datasheet supported, and said no problem, it should be quick and easy setup. However when we grabbed one of the many units we ordered, it didn't have it, so look at manual and see oh its 8.5.0 must be a new feature, so updated to 8.5.0 and still not there... so being late at night, I submit a ticket thinking maybe I'm not enabling something right, maybe need to setup radius first or its a bug... \n\nTo my surprise, support tells me it was a mistake and only included in Enterprise products...\n\nSo, I ask how can that be, its listed on main product page:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7n8tllwmw6nd1.png?width=573&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab46e56c354a829d9a0fdbd294c727cd223eec97\n\nOn Manual page, giving instructions how to add it:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/26rnoh4ww6nd1.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=a039644433e53b53ce7eef33cbfa8ae8807d3ec2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7j5xi6r1x6nd1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f9b7d09e6e513d2e5f5fe4e25aee1c85cd8d77a\n\n\n\nAnd was part of their PDF Manual...\n\nAnd even after all that they responded:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/97w673dex6nd1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed4e0b239b7f113897720c2a4e4c47536422cef4\n\n  \nThey updated all the content within hours, because by morning, it was all gone. But because I've been burned by large organizations before, I requested Internet Archive to capture those pages right after I had that response...  \n[B One - Dual WAN Router - Impressively Capable, Incredible Value (archive.org)](https://web.archive.org/web/20240828081856/https://www.peplink.com/products/soho-routers/b-one/)\n\n[Under Deep Dive \\(at bottom\\) Complete VPN Solutions](https://preview.redd.it/qdlz77l3y6nd1.png?width=745&format=png&auto=webp&s=1930b92eead21daa73e7162f87f3c198a4b2fefc)\n\n  \n[Peplink B One Series User Manual – Peplink Documentation (archive.org)](https://web.archive.org/web/20240905044119/https://manual.peplink.com/peplink-b-one-series-user-manual/)\n\n[Manual Ch18, Remote User Access](https://preview.redd.it/vuvs4naiy6nd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=30ca3f912d07d91931802bde7b3ea900170e19ea)\n\n\n\nSo all of this was documented, put in manual, was on main page, and we told our client that we can get it setup, (we have about 2 weeks to figure it out when we told them). So now we need to purchase a higher model, it goes from $300 device to about $3,000 device... And how do I know if it will even be on that one?\n\n  \nPeplinks Solution:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/14vx28f1z6nd1.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&s=50dd207b6a608b71f4b76d9fcdeb1b33ba9016b7\n\nRefund for those that we bought and go buy higher models for all of them? However we already installed most of them, plus we already negotiated and promised to client feature and a price (signed contract)\n\n  \nWe asked for at least decent discount for new one... but seems like they rather just do refund and thats it...\n\n  \nAlso this gets worse:\n\nRemember the balance two earlier in this post, we tried to figure out and thought we made mistake and didn't have the feature... well this happened before\n\n[Internet Archive VS Current, but same revision number\\/date](https://preview.redd.it/889j7z1qz6nd1.png?width=1912&format=png&auto=webp&s=778c3dca5e7dbb4f663e0657b7759244f8f0744f)\n\n  \nSo after checking Internet Archive, I realized why I could never get this working before, because this isn't the first time Peplink did this... We purchased Peplink Balance Two, and never did figure out how to get it connected to RADIUS, year or two ago... (Went another VPN Route, so wasn't big deal) and then we check the datasheet and see the feature wasn't listed (and datasheet said 202105-v2), so figure it was our mistake and somehow we thought it had it but confused it with another model. However, looking at it now, I see that it was a listed feature (when we purchased it), and then later it was removed. Also the REVISION on the PDF Stayed the same. (Attached Screenshot, of current website PDF and one from Jan 2023) so it stayed on datasheet for few years, also googling around for vendors that still sell this model (this model not being really sold anymore), they have the old datasheet that still lists it.\n\n  \n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhat should I do? I love the peplink product, have few complains...\n\n1. They did have the Balance Core Series that did overheat and needed better cooling, just add cooling pad with CPU like cooling unit with usb fan, on top seems to do the trick in warmer utility rooms.\n\n2. Their SpeedFusion isn't as stable as we hoped, it was very good at first (VoIP calls sometimes great, but many times will be robotic or cut in and out, tried all kinds of things, seems like they use Vultr and few other cheap options, and maybe its overloaded, some SFP Locations work better than others). Seems self hosted FusionHub (can use free Solo License for each organization, if only have 1 device needing it).\n\nBut overall we like their products, and like Bonding Connection feature, my option still one of the best Gateways out there.\n\nWith this situation, I wish they offered better resolution, and did update the rev of Datasheet so it didn't seem like they were trying to cover it up (maybe it was in a rush and didn't get changed, but seems like this has happened multiple times). \n\n  \nI'm bit torn if we need to look into \"False Advertising\" claim, as we did purchase these products with intent to use those features, and was driving factor, as we also were looking into newer Unifi Gateways as option, since internet fiber is becoming more frequent and Internet Bonding is becoming less a demand (and failover once in several months when fiber does have outage for little bit, is acceptable for most companies). But also, we like Company and Products, just want them to own up more to those mistakes, and offer better resolution for those that were intending to use those features.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jvc3snwsa7nd1.png?width=701&format=png&auto=webp&s=99cb0592e1bae842b6cec0eaac5281756899f0b3\n\nWe did ask if can be an addon, (we would be fine with buying it if was decently priced)\n\nWhich they responded:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjz4etk0b7nd1.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd437a0bbc09482ce58f0fda7f71f273b578e7f7\n\nBut again return isn't very feasible for us when they are mostly deployed and need replacement.",

    "page_content": "Hello all, thanks for taking the time to read and reply.  I'm a bit of an internet snob, I own a business that does quite a bit in the IT world but it's primarily homes/businesses that simply don't have a general need for a Peplink as they have fiber or fast cable and generally aren't too concerned with multi-wan options.\n\nGenerally speaking I use Ubiquiti UniFi products across the board, I'm not here to claim they are the best at anything, they just accomplish a LOT of different stuff from networking/wifi to cameras/phones/access that allows me to have a single pane of glass for dozens of clients.\n\nThat said, we have a motorhome we travel with often and a vacation house we visit here and there as well as our primary residence.  At home we've got a hefty Ubiquti setup and symmetrical Gig cable internet.\n\nOur vacation house is in a very small town and has Starlink, our motorhome has an additional Starlink.  I carry around a GL.iNet GL-MT3000 (Beryl AX) for travel and love it's ability to be a bit of a Swiss army knife at a hotel or campground etc.\n\nNow, you can imagine it's annoying to spend roughly $350/month for connectivity across the platforms.  Being that our home connection is only $55/month I think we'll stick with that regardless.  But, I'd like to explore a solid Peplink solution that I can combine whatever we have when we need it.  I really appreciate the idea of the bonding of slower connections.  IE allowing me to use the RV park provided wifi, add in tethering from one of our Verizon phones and possibly having an additional ATT/T-mobile option.  With all of those I imagine I can more or less eliminate at least one Starlink setup, travel with a compact but powerful solution and enjoy fast internet everywhere.\n\nWhat's the right move on the Peplink hardware?  I don't want to cheap out and get bare bones and regret it later, I also don't foresee a need for 10 cell connections and enterprise routers.  I imagine there is a sweet spot somewhere in there?  I appreciate any input!",

I’ve been doing some research and originally had planned to use a 5G router with a T-Mobile sim and use speedify to bond it with a starlink connection as well. \n\nAfter doing some research I’m looking at a Peplink Max BR1 5G pro, with the P1000 plan through mobile must haves. But that plan alone is $175 a month, plus about $1200 up front for hardware. That is already pretty steep on pricing.\n\nMy main question is if the RV park has included free WiFi (I know it will be slow, but it will be consistent for the most part), can I bond the WiFi and the T-Mobile 5G together without any additional hardware or software? Or would I need to use Peplinks speedfusion? I wouldn’t be opposed to using the Max BR1 5G with a T-Mobile plan and starlink, because from my understanding both can run through the BR1 and the hardware can bond the to signals without the use of a paid subscription bonding software. \n\nI’d also love to hear people setups, really just trying to figure out how to get fast consistent internet while traveling. \n\nEdit: I’m looking at pairing the BR1 Max with a mobility 42g antenna to maximize signal strength. I don’t foresee being out of 5G range for 90 percent of the time.\n\nEdit 2: max br1 pro 5g \n“This device supports WiFi-As-WAN, meaning you can pick up public WiFi signals from hotspots, campgrounds, and other sources to rebroadcast them into your coach and use them as your local internet. The wireless antennas included with this modem will pick up these signals and rebroadcast them locally within your own WiFi network.”\nThis would require a bonding software to combine with a 5G signal correct?",

It has firmware 8.3.0 which I believe is the last issue. \n\nI retired in November and left the router for my successor to use. Its on a tugboat. I am back here filling in and this thing is kicking my butt.\n\nI did a hard reset and logged into the interface. I changed the password and then setup the ssid and WPA key. \n\nAfter a few minutes I can no longer access the web interface. When I check the connection the ssid has changed itself to PepWave2 and refuses connections. \n\nWhen I reset the appliance I can get in and start over. \n\nI have attempted to use the older firmware and attempted to rewrite 8.3.0 with a newer build, no luck. \n\nI even changed Sim cards and booted without a Sim yielding the same results. \n\nIs this a virus, corrupt firmware?

    "page_content": "I just acquired a Peplink Pepwave Max HD4 off eBay for a steal at $200.\n\nI have two questions:\n\n1. Bandwidth seems lower than I've experienced in the same location with a Netgear M1 Hotspot. I've read that I should try a factory reset and only change the bare minimum, but I'm still capped at 15-20mbps, even with bonding and testing with individual cards active.\n2. Can the WWAN cards be upgraded?\n\nI seem to be hitting a bandwidth cap of about 20mbps between AT&T and T-Mobile (tested independently). I know I can get at least 40mbps from my Netgear M1 hotspot in the exact location, so I thought the antennas were an issue (they appear not to be OEM). I tested with a 2x2 MIMO YAGI antenna I have with the same results.\n\nI noticed an antenna error about cellular 2 (which has one of two T-Mobile SIMs, but didn't appear to be suffering). I tried swapping antennas to see if it would move, but it still was an issue. I decided to pop the case open and found the Aux 2 jumper cable between the 2nd WAN card and the board was disconnected. This should fix that issue, but I doubt it will help with the speeds.\n\nI was surprised this unit uses run-of-the-mill mini PCIe WWAN cards from Sierra (Model number: MC7354). I haven't found any information on compatibility with other cards or other models from Sierra. Does anybody have such information or played with an old Peplink modem to find out?\n\nI assume it may not be able to handle a 5g WWAN card, but it would be pretty awesome to upgrade it to a newer set of 4G LTE cards.\n\n  \n---\n\nEdit: I ended up purchasing a Sierra MC7455 mPCIe card off eBay, which is used in the slightly newer model HD4 LTEA units and it worked! Better download speeds at around 55mbps (vs 25-30mbps in the same testing location) and I got the LTE-A tag for that card:  [https://ibb.co/zX5FxLb](https://ibb.co/zX5FxLb)\n\nScreenshot showing the original MC7354 cards working alongside the new MC7455: [https://ibb.co/FhtB9JZ](https://ibb.co/FhtB9JZ)\n\nScreenshot showing my model info: [https://ibb.co/2vVhw0F](https://ibb.co/2vVhw0F)\n\nFor $100-120 total to replace all 4 cards in my MAX HD4, I think it's a decent upgrade since you get many more LTE channels (6 with [MC7354](https://techship.com/product/sierra-wireless-mc7354/?variant=004) and 14 LTE channels with [MC7455](https://techship.com/product/sierra-wireless-mc7455-lte-cat6/?variant=005)) and higher potential download speeds (100Mbps vs 300Mbps). Good website for comparison: [MC7354 ](https://techship.com/product/sierra-wireless-mc7354/?variant=004)vs [MC7455](https://techship.com/product/sierra-wireless-mc7455-lte-cat6/?variant=005)\n\nOnly thing to be careful of is I found several incorrectly labeled listings on eBay for the MC7455 cards. You need to make sure you know the difference between the mPCIe cards and the m.2 cards (they have different model numbers, but there are several listings with the incorrect model numbers.",

Hoping to get some recommendations on which units would be needed and answers about topology.   There's a main office with about 200 users and maybe a half dozen inbound NATs behind a WatchGuard firewall uplinked into two ISPs, both Gigabit.  Then there's three remote offices with maybe 20 users each, smaller WatchGuards and dual ISPs, limited web access, but all have site to site VPNs back to the main office.  There is only client VPN for admins to the main office.\n\nIn the past I've just configured a throwaway network between the existing firewall and the PepLink to pass any NAT traffic through, but with the VPN my brain is shorting out on how to make that work.  I'm reading that IPSec peers can only be Cisco, Juniper or PepLink, meaning the tunnels must terminate on the PepLinks as the WatchGuards are not supported?  So if we're terminating the tunnel on the PepLink and otherwise NAT'ing traffic through to the WatchGuard, are we using a LAN port on the PepLink to route tunnel traffic to/from remote subnets, bypassing the WatchGuard?  Or is there a simpler solution I'm overlooking?\n\nAlso reading that only the 380 can support the site to site VPN topology, and it looks like a 380X would be best to accommodate dual Gig ISPs.  What models would be best for the smaller remote offices?\n\nThanks for any advice you can give.",

    "page_content": "Hi All. My local peplink dealer won't work with me because I'm too small. I would greatly appreciate help designing a cellular data system for my sailboat. All advice greatly appreciated   \n\nI am embarking on 12 month cruise that will take me through the following countries: Philippines, Indonesia, S Africa, Brazil, Grenada and throughout the Caribbean. There's a few in between but too short of a period in each to mention. I will use a mid-band Iridium system offshore (Iridium Go! Exec for small weather files ) but while island hopping and in marinas I want a mobile data solution. Most of these locations are still 3G, some 4G or LTE. If I can get a wifi antenna in a combo, great, but not necessary enough to warrant a second antenna and set of cabling.\n\nI need/want to mount the antenna part way up my mast on a horizontal support called a spreader. It will provide about 35 feet of elevation and is the only place I can reasonably mount the antenna. The distance to my equipment would be another 4 meters of cable run..say 15m total. A fat low loss cable could be extremely difficult too run inside the mast. I can't go up the mast to change sim cards at every port. \n\nI think I need something like the H1 Dome and a Sim Injector. As mentioned,  I don’t have room for more than one or two cables (vs. 5 on the 20G/40G antennas) and I will lose about 8 dB gain in that cable run distance. Will the H1 Dome and A sim injector using a simple Cat7 cable to a router work for me?\n\nIf so, which router?\n\nI can run any voltage needed.\n\nThanks again. ",

I am seeing almost no change between WAN Smoothing on and off. My one WAN is about 100mbps and the other is about 50mbps. \n\nShould I not be maybe limited to 50mbps total since that is the speed of my slowest link and since it has to duplicate the 50mbps packets over the 100mbps link, that leaves only 50 for data. \n\nSo my speed test should basically be 50mbps?\n\nOr am I misunderstanding how WAN smoothing works.\n\nI also did some tests pulling the cable mid speedtest, and it does recover but it takes 3-5 seconds to do it, and I lose some pings.\n\nSince data SHOULD be being duplicated should I not be losing pings?\n\nAgain, not understanding.

Yes their apparently is some simple facility that statically reports these metrics when logged into Incontrol2 program via IOS or Windows Desktop by clicking on the current BR1 LAN IPv4 address you get the main plus two CA channels with static metrics. THis is great for instant spot checks but does not provide the continuously updating graphics needed to view as you change the physical attributes/locations/attitude of the antenna.\n\nAny other sources for this style of antenna signal strength/quality measurements with real-time viewing?",

Got the device, inserted SIM card, did a few checks everything seemed to be working fine, except when I decided to dig deeper and connect newly purchased device to Peplink's InControl got the message it belongs to another organization. Followed Peplink's instruction, apparently I needed to contract seller or previous owner (who would have thought...) as they're the only once who can remove me from their organization. After countless hrs on the phone with Amazon with different customer service agents and Amazon Warehouse (apparently its different from Amazon Customer Service - side note) about how to find the previous owner, Amazon simply decided to pay me off by offering me 50% of the purchase price - roughly $185, with the ability of keeping the device or returning it for the full amount. Well that's great and stuff, however this is not a money problem (and for all of you smart once saying I wouldn't be in this situation if it wasn't for the money and purchased brand new device in the first place,  you're right)\n\nSee, while I was calling Amazon I was also emailing Peplink and I providing them with all of the necessary info they need such as receipts from Amazon etc, anything they'd want to proof I'm legal owner of said device. But when they learned  the device is used they basically flipped me of regardless of what kind of proof I have. Now, I said it's not the money problem because, I've been rethinking this over, what's going to happen with this device ? It's obvious the only choice I have is to return it back to Amazon. What will Amazon do with it? Resell it ? I doubt it. Trash it ? Probably. Why? Why wouldn't Peplink remove it from old organization ? Clearly it's an oversight by previous owner - who cares ? Why not remove it and give it a second life? And for these of you wondering, it is working great with my sim  (Verizon) except somebody apparently has some control over it (I'm still able to login locally over IP and change internal settings))\n\nI'm not sure what exactly I'm looking for here but it paints me to think that because of some bureaucratic  bs someone will trash a perfectly fine working device. The device it self btw is superior of anything else I've had before, and after making it from coast to coast I can say it has much better and stable reception compare to anything else I had before, manly Verizon MoFi. And that's with default antennas, I wonder what it can do with the big antenna they have...",

But I generally need to assist (in an engineering roll)  with some configuration and checking things over.

Bonus points if the connection is maintained through the bonded routes with peplink (SFC I think it's called)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm suspicious that my best bet is to just bite the bullet and move myself over to their speedfusion product or buy another device for my home office for me to connect into from my existing home office VPN but that'll add some complexity.\n\nAnother alterntaive would be to add a device such as a raspberry pi, as a client connected to my existing VPN, which I can then access and traverse the network, but again complexity.\n\nCurious if anyone has any input or suggestions.",

With weaker signals both inside *and* outside of the RV. \n\nI’m aware that the cables themselves will be somewhat lossy but is this expected performance or is there a way to improve it? What’s especially shocking is that the signal with onboard antennas manages to penetrate the RV’s walls (with their rats nest of poorly shielded DC wires inside) and provide a stronger signal than when the signal originated on the roof. \n\nMainly I want to be able to access the RV WiFi from inside my truck. The router is mounted towards the rear of the RV. Which I can’t quite accomplish in either situation. If it can’t be done then it can’t be done; but I was wondering if there was perhaps any sort of troubleshooting steps here.",

I've finally gotten things hooked up as best as I can running starlink in through the WAN port and connecting the Tmobile through a Wifi as WAN as well.  \n\nWhat is irritating me though is that whether I use the WIFI antennas that plug directly into the router or the external one that supposedly is a better antenna.  It has a far crappier signal than either the tmobile box that came with the service, or the starlink router I comes with DISHY.  So if I want to have aggregation and intelligent switching between the sources, I have to use by far the crappiest WIFI signal.  Where the others are at 92%, the peplink is at <70%.    \n\nIs this possibly something I'm doing wrong?   Is there something to fix?  ",

I'm trying to set up two Peplink routers - one with the Open VPN client, and one without - so that one router is dedicated to OVPN/IOT devices (all wirelessly connected).\n\nAt the moment, I have the configuration working - with the non-VPN router (B30 Pro) attached on a USB uplink (to an LTE hotspot) and the VPN router (Surf Soho) connected via Wi-Fi as WAN to the same hotspot. Works - but VPN drops from time-to-time (not sure if due to WiFi or VPN).\n\nSo - setup is follows:\n\n* PepLink Surf Soho w/Open VPN Client (required to deal with T-Mobile video throttling)\n* Balance 30 Pro. Can't install Open VPN client on Balance 30 Pro (RMA issues).\n* Internet uplink is via LTE hotspot. 4G LTE@10-40 Mbps down. Either router can do USB WAN; only SOHO can do WiFi WAN.\n* VPN provider is Proton.\n* Support for 3 or 4 VLANs (work dedicated, personal/home dedicated, VPN dedicated, and potentially guest)\n* No Ethernet LAN/hardwire required except for occasional troubleshooting\n\nI could run everything off the SoHo - but it's a bit underpowered (esp. if I ever get better 5G service).\n\nWondering if the following configuration can be set up, and if so - what I'd have to do to accomplish it?Objective would be to avoid WiFi as WAN.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i418ac7202kb1.png?width=1394&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1aeea66bc44185c0a74af3c877886f2a4eefc64\n\nSo - if this can be accomplished:\n\n* What do I have to do on the Balance 30 - Set up some service passthrough with IPSEC NAT-T? Or does this have to be done at all (enabled by default?).\n* How do I set up B30 LAN port as DHCP to Ethernet WAN on SOHO, or bar that - set static route between the two?\n* Beside setting up the VPN client on the SOHO (already done) and the IOT VLAN - is there any other config required on the Soho?\n\nSimply put, how do I get this to work with the least amount of grief? For some reason, can't wrap my head around how the IP addressing/routing should work between the two boxes, and - if I have to set up some service passthrough - how/where that is done.\n\nThanks!",

I don't want to return it or get service - just purchase a feature license that is a software add-on. The router is for personal/home use only.\n\nI've updated it to the latest production 8.3 software - so certainly no problems running their latest production codebase. I only bought it (Balance 30 Pro) because it had more throughput than the Soho (which I might need) and because the SOHO has been discontinued - and looks like she soho will not support the 9.x codebase with wireguard (if/when it's released).\n\nAnyone had any success in getting service for an RMA unit, or clearing the RMA status, or even talking to someone live at PepLink?",

    "page_content": "Hey guys, \n\nLooking for some feedback on options I can take for internet plans/ hardware setup.  \nCurrently a remote SWE who just built out a new camper van, ready to hit the road. My internet setup right now is:\n\n\\- Pepwave Max Transit Duo (Exact product code is: MAX-TST-DUO-LTEA-R-T-PRM) Non-5g model  \n\\- Tmobile Magenta Tablet Data w/ 50GB Data (It's been okay, can be unstable)  \n\\- pepwave 42g antenna  \n\\- Ubiquti NanoHD AP  \nI purchased the pepwave device a year ago not expecting to want to jump on the 5g train. Now im diving into LTE and 5G plans and I wish I purchased a 5g capable Pepwave device. \n\nRequirements:  \n\\- Ideally one router/ modem combo to limit power consumption  \n\\- Stable connection, 20-30 mb down is fine for me. I'm a remote SWE, who just needs to push my git code up to github.   \n\\- I dont game, I just stream netflix or hulu once in a while.   \n\\- Estimated 500gb/ month usage based on my mac statistics.  \n\\- (Nice to have) Running home assistant server in my camper, so having a static IP + be able to run a VPN Server on the router would be nice. \n\nA few options that I am exploring:\n\n1. TMobile Small Business Internet (BYOD). I just went to a Tmobile store today and got my business account set up, and also required a static IP. I could just use their device (probably a [Arcadyan KVD21](https://www.t-mobile.com/support/home-internet/arcadyan-gateway) gateway) and ditch the pepwave. I am probably going to experiment with putting the SIM into my existing max transit and seeing how that goes. \n2. Mobile Must Have P1000 Plan -- Been emailing them back and forth, and they have a exclusive plan for their customers. I'd have to sell my pepwave and purchase one from them to go for this plan. its 1000gb/month for $175. \n3. Get something else besides Tmobile Magenta. Atnt or Verizon? Any recs?\n\nNot sure if I'm overthinking the 5g devices or not. Has anyone really seen an impact in speeds/ reliability with the addition of a device that is capable of 5g bands?\n\nAlso I'm seeing a mixed bag of reactions from reddit on pepwave embedded modems. I hear folks complain about more and more IMEI locks from carriers (IE the crack down from visible lately). \n\nAny input would be greatly appreciated, especially from RVers or van lifers who work on the road.

It will be setup with T-Mobile and Starlink as primary and AT&T as secondary but don't really want AT&T as failover.. i am looking for stability and reducing data usage per connection over speed but if i can hit 200+ mbps down would be good too because i can easily do 100-150 mbps on Starlink and T-Mobile 5G UC.. what would you recommend? I'm thinking the cat 7 modem will likely be the bottle neck in this setup because of the 2xCA on both upload and download... What suggestions do you have?",

After creating PEP profiles, the tunnel doesn't start, it shows \"Starting\" for a while, then \"Creating tunnels\", then returns to \"Starting\". After some investigations, such as Packet Capturing, I found out that during the handshake phase, Branch is negotiating with Main's addition IP \"3.3.3.3\", and it's successfully done. When the Data phase starts, Branch doesn't continue negotiating with \"3.3.3.3\", instead it's trying to establish the tunnel using Main's primary IP \"1.1.1.1\" which is not routable over the internet because it's a private one.  \n We tried the NAT mapping, it worked. However, it's not an optimal solution for our case. The question is, is there any way to use the Main's additional IP for establishing the tunnel? Or the tunnel should be established using the Main's primary IP \"1.1.1.1\"? Appreciate any help you can provide.",

I also consulted mobileinternetresourcecenter.com but that requires a membership to open the technical guides.   \n\nI am not very technically savvy but have done my best to educate myself on what is going on here.

    "page_content": "Hi, new to peplink.\n\nMy company is asking me to find a WAN load balancer and I stumbled to peplink products.What I gathered so far, is that I need a balance router.Currently, I have 2 leased lines from two different ISP's with 100mbps each.\n\nOur goal is to bond the two ISP's to increase bandwidth and take advantage of features such as HOT FAILOVER, WAN SMOOTHING, and FEC. These features are quiet promising and hard to find from other vendors. But  I have few questions in mind:\n\n1. Do I need to subscribe to \"speedfusion cloud\" to use the bandwidth bonding, WAN smoothing, and FEC?\n2. If yes, how does SFC plans work? because If ever we add more ISP's with higher bandwidth, the SFC with 200mbps speed seems like a bottleneck? Will it defeat the purpose of bonding to have increased bandwidth of more than 200mbps?\n3. Do I need speedfusion cloud subscription to use bandwidth bonding only? because as i understood how this technology works, packets from destinations are disassembled and reassembled in the other end (so that means you need another peplink device on the other end), but this is only applicable to branch to branch. If I apply this idea to my current goal which is just to bond ISP's, who will reassemble the packets that were segmented from my source? So does that mean I need speedfusion cloud to reassemble those packets and leave speedfusion cloud send it to its destinations?\n\nI could not find any documentations that fits my current setup. All I can see in bandwidth bonding is that it needs another peplink device on the other end or subscribe to speedfusion cloud.",

I have corresponding wireless networks off the Ruckus R510 access points.\n\nI was setting up some home theater components (now on the IoT subnet), with my iPhone on the trusted network. Two examples here are the Marantz App (paired with the HEOS app) and the apple remote that is natively included in current iOS.\n\nMarantz and HEOS app - were working perfectly fine for a week or so. Now - sometimes I can connect, but often I cannot (or after it connects, I am booted from the app).\n\nApple Remote - would connect to Apple TV initially, but had to get the phone on the IoT network to pair the phone with Apple TV. After which, most of the time it works fine from the trusted network, sometimes it works only with some buttons, and other times it has issues connecting to the AppleTV.\n\nI do have firewall rules prohibiting traffic from IoT to Trusted, and am logging violators in the event log (no drops shown in the firewall event log).  I also setup bonjour forwarding from IoT to Trusted (but not the other way around).\n\nCan anyone provide some insight as to what might be going on?\n\nThanks in advance!",

Then it needs a 15 second vacation for some time off to relax and refresh, and it comes back good as new after power is restored.

One is a Microhard Bullet CAT11 LTE modem, and the other is a T-Mobile Home Internet 5G router.  I am not using the built in CAT4 modem because it is only CAT4.  The TMHI works well most of the time, but wants to be cycled every week or two, or it acts up.  The Microhard is \"good kit\" and rarely acts up.  I probably power cycle it every few months at the most.\n\nI have yet to determine how often the Peplink Balance 20X needs a time out, but it seems to be less than once a week.  I would be happy to reboot it weekly if there was an easily automated way to do it.  (I am not a fan of putting network infrastructure on lamp timers.)\n\n**Is there a command line interface to the Peplink, and/or an API that could be used to check health and/or reboot it?**  UIs are nice and all, but they are not well suited to automation.\n\n**Does anyone have any suggestions for what health metrics to look at to realize that the Peplink is acting up, or getting close to acting up?**  I would rather restart in response to detecting the start of a problem rather than do it every week, if I could.",

Looking at online reviews, it appears the included power adapter is interchangeable, but it doesn't state if other adapter types are included.\n\nAustralia uses Type I connector, and runs on 50Hz / 240v. Looking at the documentation for the Surf SOHO, it seems to be able to handle up to 240v, so am just wondering if the Type I connector is included, or if an international adapter will be needed.

I could also be interested in a 5G Flex Module Mini.  \n\nI have a Peplink Balance 20X that I am using to bond connections between a T-Mobile 5G Home Internet device and a CAT11 LTE device.  I am able to connect both of these by using a USB-Ethernet adapter in the single USB port, and the single WAN port.  Now I am maxed out on WAN connections from the Peplink unless I use the CAT4 LTE modem that is built in (what a WASTE!) or if I can get something useful for the Flex Mini port.\n\nMy next internet connection will probably be Starlink, and once that is stable, I will probably cancel the LTE service.  It would be really sweet to have all of them connected at the same time.\n\nSpeaking of sweet... it would be really nice if Peplink succeeded in working with T-Mobile to get one or more (preferably all) of the Peplink 5G products approved for use with the T-Mobile Home Internet plan.  100 GB for $50 might work for a business backup, but it is a non-starter for the residential market.",

What I understand so far is that it make sense to separate the modem from the router. I was thinking to buy the SOHO router (is this a good choice for my needs?😅) but I am wondering if and how I can connect a phone to it. I don't know if that is important but I live in Germany. \n\nThank you very much for your feedback and suggestions in advance 🥰",

Sure, it is 2.5G, but there is still only one.\n* Two LAN ports, but they are only 1G each.\n* No USB port, which on the Balance 20X allows me to work around the limit of only one WAN port.\n* Not supported, as far as I can tell, by T-Mobile Home Internet, Verizon 5G Home Internet, or whatever AT&T will be doing to try to compete in this space.\n\nAdvantages:\n\n* Fast processor, supporting 1 Gbps router throughput.\n* Supports external antennas -- big improvement over TMHI device.\n\nOpportunities:\n\n* If Peplink were to work with T-Mobile and/or Verizon, I could see this becoming popular with power home users who hate the limitations of the vendor supplied devices.  The TMHI 5G device is really unpopular.  Unfortunately, TMHI service is locked to the IMEI range of their Nokia built devices.\n\nSo, who is this for?\n\n* You probably view your 5G connection as your backup connection.\n* You are not locked into using a vendor's device for 5G internet.\n* You are never need more than 1G on any LAN connection, and/or you have a switch that supports bonding across two 1G links.\n* You never care about being able to upgrade from the current built-in 5G device, and still use this router.\n\n**Bottom Line:**\n\n**Seems like this could have been a great device with minimal changes, but it was apparently designed to be handicapped.**",

Most of my multi wan testing has been with a combination of Verizon and TMobile wireless connections. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen trying to video stream remotely from a computer running OBS (open broadcast software) I found I would also get dropped frames (the green would turn to red light in the bottom right corner) when using SFC. In those instances (two attempts at different locations) if I would drop the SpeedFusion connection and simply use the Verizon connection alone, OBS was completely happy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few weeks ago I interacted with Peplink support and they remotely configured an SFC connection from my UBR-LTE to an SFC site that initially looked like an improvement in speeds over what I had been getting. But with closer examination I found that the encryption was not enabled which meant it was apples and oranges for comparison. My further tests between my two devices have suggested that I simply never get better speeds (up or down) with two WAN connections than I do with a single connection (the fastest one for either up or down).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm looking for success stories with bonded cellular connections with Peplink routers and perhaps some info about how you got there, how you have measured and verified the performance and how you use the bonded connection.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks,",

    "page_content": "From reading the documentation, it looks like a virtual server with one vCPU, 1 GB RAM is \"good\" for running FusionHub Solo.  (Why can't they just come out and say that at the top of the document?)\n\nVultr has a unit like this for $5 / month with 1 TB of bandwidth usage / traffic.  My concern is that this may work out to less than a half TB of actual SpeedFusion use.  There is some SpeedFusion overhead, and then most cloud providers charge both incoming and outgoing bandwidth to your quota.  \n\nSo even ignoring the overhead, any WAN Smoothing between 2 devices would APPEAR to use of 3x the amount of data used.  (2 devices each writing one copy of the data to FusionHub, and FusionHub writing 1 copy to the Internet --- and the reverse on the download side)   Bonding would be better at only 2x the effective usage.  (2 devices each writing 50% of data to FusionHub, and FusionHub writing 100% to the Internet, etc.  Plus overhead.)\n\nThe same price at [ionos.com](https://ionos.com) will get me their VPS Medium, which has 2 vCPUs, 2 GB RAM, and unlimited traffic, with up to 400 Mbps of bandwidth.  Both Vultr and Ionos have data centers in New Jersey, only a couple hundred miles away.  400 Mbps should be sufficient for a Balance 20X bonding / smoothing across 2 cellular connections that add up to less than 100 Mbps.\n\nAWS is much more expensive.  **What other companies should I look at?**",

    "page_content": "Please check my math here.\n\nI currently have two cellular connections via a CAT11 LTE modem, and a 5G /r/tmobileisp Home Internet device.  Neither as as fast as I would like, and the T-Mobile device speeds vary wildly.  I currently have them set up as primary and failover on my r/Unifi Dream Machine Pro.   I want to eventually replace the more expensive LTE connection with r/Starlink once that is available here.  I am considering adding a Peplink into the mix, but I am trying to understand the costs.\n\nI have been told that a Peplink Balance 20X is the most cost effective option.  It only has a single WAN port, but it has a USB port that could accept a USB to Ethernet adapter to be my second WAN port.  (It bugs me to \"waste\" the built in cellular modem, but it is only CAT4.)   Commonly available price seems to be $399 for the device.  (Add $20 for a USB-Ethernet adapter, based on a quick check at Amazon.)\n\nFor the first year, PrimeCare is included, which includes use of Peplink SpeedFusionCloud, limited to 100 Mbps and 500 GB of use.  Hopefully that lasts over half a month.    After that, I purchase \"add on\" data at $29.90 to $40 a TB.  The sweet spot appears to be 2.5 GB for $80, at $32 per TB.  \n\nSo, assuming 1 TB a month of usage, monthly service cost would be  about $35, factoring in the annual PrimeCare fee.  \n\nI was trying to talk myself into a much more expensive device, but this seems like enough to dramatically improve my experience.  Two connections that are normally about 40/20 and 30/10, and individually a little flakey could become a single 70/30 connection with higher stability.  \n\n**Did I get the basics right?**  \n\nWorst case seems to be that after I get Starlink, the SpeedFusionCloud might be my limiting factor, effectively capping me at 100 Mbps down.  However, the reliability would be even more important than max speed.  \n\n**What USB/Ethernet adapter do your recommend?**\n\nOne seller with 20x listed at $399:  [https://5gstore.com/product/9766\\_peplink\\_balance\\_20x\\_cat4.html](https://5gstore.com/product/9766_peplink_balance_20x_cat4.html)\n\nLink to SpeedFusion Cloud prices: [https://www.peplink.com/software/speedfusion-cloud/](https://www.peplink.com/software/speedfusion-cloud/)",

However, if I plug a laptop directly into one of the ports on the modem and set the laptop with a static IP within the modem's subnet I am able to connect.\n\nFor example, my Peplink LAN is on 192.168.100.1/24. The modem has an IP of 192.168.200.1, but that is inaccessible from the LAN on the Balance 210.\n\nI have read a number of forums mentioning static routes alone are not able to make the connection and that a second interface needs to be added to the WAN (I understand that last bit only very loosely). Aside from not understanding what the needed configuration is, I also do not see how I would make those additional configs to the WAN. I also tried SSHing into the CLI, but the only documentation I found seemed to have limited operations available.\n\nAny suggestions? Thanks in advance!",

My Balance 30 won't be able to handle the load. I've tried replacing it with a TP-Link TL-R605, but that product doesn't have the real-time indicators that I'm accustomed to (and that I rely upon for trouble-shooting when the connections are flaky).\n\nSo I'd like to stay within the Peplink product line.

The Balance 20 is the closest with its optional third WAN, but it tops out at 150Mbps.\n\nAm I missing something? Any suggestions for my use case?\n\nThanks!\n\n\nEdit for anyone who ends up here from google... Thanks to all for pointing me to the Balance One.

Cell Tower shows bands [2,4,5,17,30,66] on cell mapper.  I have used a laptop recently that pulled down 60Mbps inside the building.\n\n\nA few questions:\n\nWhat antennas and setup do you recommend for best performance?\n\n\n(1) Four single yagi antennas (700Mhz-2700Mhz ?)\n\n(2) Two 2x2 MIMO antennas (can they point in the same direction ?)\n\n(3) One 4x4 MIMO antenna (can you get these yet?)\n\n\nI would prefer a directional antenna but not sure how the setup works with four singles (Angling the antennas at 45 degrees etc.) or two antennas.\n\nThank You!",

Both devices have served me well for the last 4-5 years.\n\nWithin the last year or so, the One randomly reboots and has become unreliable. In an 1,100 sq ft space, it has a hard time getting a strong WiFi signal to the perimeter edge. There are many WiFi signals nearby so I suspect that has something to do with it. I bought a AC Mini to act as a wired signal booster but that didn’t work out too well. Devices connected to it didn’t perform any better.\n\nIs there anything consumer grade’ish that could replace the dying One? I see the Two is out, but I can’t justify the price. I am a “power user” and have a 20+ devices connected to the One at any given time, split between Ethernet and WiFi. I like being able to control which MAC addresses use the two different WAN connections.\n\nThanks!",

See the detailed info at: https://spectreattack.com or https://meltdownattack.com\n\nThe discovered security flaws are caused by “speculative execution”, a technique used by most modern processors to optimize performance. These flaws could lead to disclosure of sensitive data stored in the privileged memory (which is normally allocated to privileged processes or the operating system kernel) to a malicious party. The reported flaws were later acknowledged by respective CPU vendors in official statements.\n\nWe have evaluated our products and online services to assess the impact of this vulnerability.\n\n**Products**\n\n* The only affected products are Balance with MediaFast 200, MediaFast 500 and MediaFast 750. A patch to fix the vulnerabilities will be released within firmware 7.1.0.\n\n **Temporary solution** is to switch off Docker and ContentHub functionality on affected devices.\n\n\n* All other Balance series besides the above are not affected.\n\n \n* MAX, FusionHub, Surf and AP series are not affected.\n\n***FAQ***\n\n**Malicious Code**\nMost of our products are closed systems that do not allow customers to run custom code on the device -therefore most products are not vulnerable.\n\nIn order to exploit the vulnerabilities, an attacker must be able to locally run the code on an affected device. Device administrators of affected devices are recommended to review access rights of all parties with admin privileges until the vulnerability is patched.\n\n**Performance Impact**\nPerformance impact (if any) on MediaFast Series will be shared after the firmware update release. We expect negligible impact on performance. Learn more in the following Security Blog: https://security.googleblog.com/2018/01/more-details-about-mitigations-for-cpu_4.html\n\n**FusionHub and InControl2 Virtual Appliance on AWS, GCE and Azure**\nAccording to official statements from Amazon, Google and Microsoft, AWS, GCE and Azure platforms have already been successfully patched.\n\nIf you are using services of other cloud platform vendors, make sure their platforms are successfully patched.\n\n**Private Virtual Machines (VMware, Citrix XenServer, Oracle VirtualBox and Microsoft Hyper-V)**\nMake sure you are using the latest versions of hypervisor software (that include fixes to the above vulnerabilities) in your deployments.\n\n**Further Updates**\nThis advisory may be updated if any additional information regarding the above vulnerabilities becomes available.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\\###\n\n&nbsp;\n\nsource: https://forum.peplink.com/t/peplink-security-advisory-cve-2017-5753-cve-2017-5715-spectre-cve-2017-5754-meltdown/13814",
