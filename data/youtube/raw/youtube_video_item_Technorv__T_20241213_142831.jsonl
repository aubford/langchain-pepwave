{"id": "QYEYL5HQJ3Y", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "vC7CmgvgXuLHOw95DRHG51udiBo", "transcript": "hey it's Eric over at techno RV got Tammy behind the camera she's going to make an appearance in this video and today we're going to give you the tour of our ATC toy hauler it's the 2015 model so to get started the Box length is just a little bit over 20 ft and then the rest of the tongue area here is just a little bit over 5T so I'm maybe about 26t or so going down the road and then the width is about 8' 5 in so let's just start from the front do the entire circle outside and then we'll go inside and show you what's in there all right the ATC comes with a Lippert power jack uh two propane tanks and then it's got this generator tray up here that you can uh have them install like a permanent generator we opted not to do that because we've got our own portable generator so maybe we've got a little extra storage there uh we do use the Anderson weight distribution hitch that's installed on here that you can see and these atcs are all aluminum the box is all aluminum the the frames all aluminum and this aluminum frame is actually 8 in and uh so that seems pretty stout to me so I'm pleased with that so moving to the front uh here we do have just a little bit of storage in the front uh here uh not a lot but this kind of goes all the way through here so let's just kind of go around the other side and take a look all right here's the other uh storage area here and then of course you've got uh your water uh on off for your uh winterization and you've got a couple of lithium batteries here and we do have a solar panel on the roof and uh so anyway not a whole lot of storage here but just a little bit I do have an outside water spigot here and then of course we've got our stabilization uh Jacks here they're not powered so I got to hand crank those and uh so anyway if we move down the side you can see we have a door here that's just a pass through to what you already saw there uh we've got our uh Suburban uh water heater up up here we've got our freshwater connection here and our black water flush here moving down we have a cable connection here and then our 50 amp hookup now this unit is 50 amps which I thought was a little bit strange in that this unit only has one AC unit so I did ask them why did they do 50 amp they said it's just a manufacturing thing so they didn't have to have all the different parts for 30 amp and 50 amp units so anyway with 50 amps obviously I'm going to have plenty of power to run this thing uh my black and gray tanks uh flushes are here uh and then obviously that's where you connect your sewer hose to it does come with uh Goodyear tires and it comes because this is a toy hauler and we're going to be uh hauling around our four-wheeler in it it does come with a gasoline tank on it of 36 gallons which I think is pretty cool so we can use that for our generator and for our four-wheeler when we're off grid uh this unit has a 100gal fresh tank that's bigger than our class A that we had uh 45 gallon gray 45g uh black tank 6 gallon hot water heater the exterior height is about 113 all right so this is the back so obviously this folds down it's going to make a patio we're going to show you that and then of course it goes all the way to the ground so that you can run uh in our case a four-wheeler up going down the side of the unit here it does have a fulllength uh awning here and uh up underneath here it's actually got uh your spare tire and it's kind of got this cool Contraption to where you just take the pen out grab this handle and you can pull it out and the tire comes out and I noticed also under here it does have a speaker up under here and a speaker underneath over here so that if you have your TV or you want to listen to music outside it's got that and then this is a place that you can uh attach a TV outside you can take the inside TV put it out here it's got another cable outlet here couple of electrical outlets your grab handle front door does have a light on the outside uh and then this door up here is actually locked this door is actually locked but I can handle this check this out okay all right remember that gas tank I was telling you about it's literally got do this a gas nozzle here how's that come out it's like you're at a gas station like literally except except it's easier than what you're seeing here so I've never used that but anyway it's the full thing you pull it out you you gas something up uh that didn't go as planed but you get the idea there let's go inside up our uh liard solid steps here and uh check out the inside of the AR RV welcome to the inside of our RV come on in now remember we're under 200 squ feet here so uh I'm in the dining room and now I'm in the kitchen now I'm in the living room and the bedroom oh and the bedroom yeah because the bed's up here uh so just a quick look here so there's a a couple of different scenarios obviously this is the bed it's on a happy jack system so that's going to come down when we're ready to sleep uh that door goes down and creates a a deck and that's the railing for the deck back here that we'll show you it does have a couch back here that does fold into a bed which will never use but when my four-wheeler in here you roll it out like this and then this whole thing goes up against the wall we'll show you that on another video when we load our our four-wheeler up uh we added this table here to put our Burk key on and then also because the TV's up front and we don't like sitting here and kind of doing this we thought well we'll just buy this and when we want to watch TV we can just set the TV right here and then it's just a much more more comfortable position uh moving forward into this area this is obviously the dinette this table whenever you put your toy in here whatever in our case a four-wheeler this actually folds up and slides down into a slot here so it'll sit flush against this and then when you get somewhere you can just pull it back out all right let's talk about our dining room and then the storage area up here which I think Tammy's going to use this as a pantry so uh let me step into our dining room here and uh you've got this uh table here and when we got it it had two big benches here that were similar to the big couch over here just not as long but they really came out to maybe right here and out to here and kind of equally on this side very bulky took up a lot of room we we didn't like it and uh so we took them out and then we just got a couple of chairs and you got these chairs from a church outlet store okay all right so all right so if we miss church we just come sit in these chairs here and we're good they were 30 bucks okay good $30 chairs they're pretty comfortable so uh anyway it really created a lot more space in here and so onto the cabinets uh this is all aluminum and I I really love kind of the utility type look in here and you'll notice these cabinets are very tall and so Tammy put uh a shoe rack is that a shoe rack yeah okay Tammy put a Sho Rack in here to create some different levels so that the pantry yeah so we can use the space uh that's provided here and create uh those levels and then uh up here is just your your Breakers and so again this a a 50 amp unit so you've got the two 50 amp Breakers in there uh and then moving over to the kitchen more storage up top and Tammy did the same thing over here and put another shoe rack in here for uh dishes and things like that and then we've got like a a coffee maker and and it's not packed complely yet no it's not but uh anyway we feel like for a unit this size that it's it's got some pretty decent storage all right moving into the kitchen you've got a two burner propane stove top that closes to create a little bit more counter space a microwave convection convection microwave uh and then pretty big sink right yeah you got kind of this thing here and I don't know that can create some more counter space but yeah I thought it was a good size sink for this and then you've got uh this is all drawers here um on down and and then this is just a little bit more storage and there's a little uh false wall back here that uh gives you access to you know all the stuff back here in in case you need to uh work on your RV uh we do have a a radio system this also controls the volume for your TV because we do have speakers in the ceiling and then we have our refrigerator uh few more yeah a little bit more storage up here so deep very yeah uh that's the challenge is the storage space that you have in like a cabinet like this even the bathroom will go in there and look there're so deep uh but anyway 12vt fridge and freezer and we we again we thought we were kind of impressed that they they put one this size in here um yeah pretty pleased with that uh and then up front we've got our TV up here and then we've got a a closet that for more storage it's got a little bar up here so you can hang some closeth and uh so thought they did good there oh before we move on uh my favorite thing about the whole ATC is oh gosh ATC actually went through the trouble of putting some undercounter uh LED lights and oh hold on what in the world is going on here okay uh you can do different colors and I try and put it on crimson uh for Alabama yeah and I turn it off and then not because of the Alabama thing because you just you're kind of but but I like doing this and really creating the atmosphere in here right so uh if you ever come visit this uh I'll probably put the light show on for you so again like that and then the other remote control you have over here is your max air we've got uh a fan here in the kitchen and then we got one in the bathroom and then we have the Firefly uh unit here that kind of controls everything in the RV and this is I suspect it's coming standard on a lot of RVs these days but the big Class A that we had was a 16 and it it didn't even have anything like this so all my lights I can control from here I can see all my tank levels I can see my uh Power uh what I'm get I'm getting 125 volts from the shore power right now um you can control your AC your heater from here you can lift lower the bed and put the awning out uh and it has an app for your phone as well oh yeah yeah because you downloaded the app I haven't done that yet but you can do it from the app too so that's kind of cool all right before we go into the bathroom uh we did a trip to Colorado in which case I wanted to downsize and we did it all in a 6x1 12 cargo trailer like just an empty box and uh Tammy's got standards and so she said look I'm all about all this off grid and stuff uh but I need a bathroom uh and a kitchen and a bed because we just threw a mat down so uh I was okay with that so quick story about how we ended up with the ATC all right the bathroom is important uh I'm kind of a big guy 63 so I like to come in here and kind of see what kind of space I have so I've got plenty of room with the toilet here um it's got a decent size little vanity area here with a couple of little storage uh doors and then there's just more storage in here and these are so deep can you get that like look how deep that is 24 in deep yeah look here I don't even know if I can reach the back there see uh there's that one this one and this one they're all that deep and then the shower of course anytime I go look at an RV I always got to get in the shower again I'm 63 and I mean it's not like a regular home shower but it does have this neat Rod that goes out so I can kind of get in here and move around wash my hair right plenty of head room removable shower head oh yeah yeah that helps okay the bed uh it's up here Tammy's going to go ahead and lower it for you uh these two right here it comes with like a little ladder but we're not even going to bring that with us because we're going to lower it enough to where we can just jump up in there uh it's a happy jack system and the this is not the original Mattress oh no uh ATC I'm not sure they did very good on the mattress it was like a Saltine cracker and we slept on it one night and decided we're too old for that that should be good and it can go go lower but we ordered this mattress online and it comes in a box like this in this tall and then it just poof it just comes out I don't know how they get it in the box but uh anyway we have not slept on this one but visually I can tell you it's got to be better than what came in here so uh anyway this is the sleeping quarter it just goes up and down and uh so we're going to move this back up and then we're going to go ahead and put the back down for you so we can look look at the patio area all right let's lower the deck and show you what the back patio looks [Music] [Applause] [Music] like [Music] all right so you saw how to put it together and then you can kind of see from the inside really flows nicely from the kitchen and dining room in the living room uh right out to the back it's really stable and uh the uh railing makes it nice kind of a safety feature there and then uh you can always get a you know a nice view no matter where you're at and then also up top here it does have some roll down panels so if you were somewhere and you wanted like the inside uh to not get the outside air you could uh roll those down as well so there you have it there's our ATC 2015 model we couldn't be more excited we're ready to hit the road in it in upcoming videos we're going to do all kinds of upgrades and things like that so keep an eye out for that as well and in the meantime safe travels", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2023-11-19T23:51:15Z", "channelId":

I thought that a propane tank surely had something safety built in that would shut the propane off if there were a leak or cut in the line but it actually does not so this tank is actually filled with air and I've got a line connected to it as if this was your RV and if I turn this tank on and then I feel it pressurized to my thumb if I let this go as if I've got a leak you can see that there is still propane coming out of the tank so gas stop developed a device that goes in line in your propane tank uh and actually it detects a leak or rupture in the line it will 100 shut off your propane they're so easy to install and use that we recommend it for all rvers they're relatively inexpensive and what what's going on here is that this device here has a a ball bearing that is tuned that it will shut off and drop into an O-ring if the flow gets above 75 000 BTU so anything below that would be just your normal usage uh that in your RV whether it be a heater hot water heater or something like that all that's going to be fine but if you were to have a rupture or a cut that's where this is going to jump into action and I want to show you just kind of how easy this is so this is your propane line from your RV literally all you do is screw the gas stop onto the propane tank and then connect your RV back up to the gas stop and the install is done okay so now if I turn the propane back on in order to set the ball bearing I just need to pump the gauge a few times and now I feel it pressurized on the end of my thumb here and now if I were to have a leak this automatically shut the propane off so I don't have any propane coming through the line and that was all thanks to the gas stock so that's how that device works and I think it's essential for RVs [Music]", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2023-01-31T16:19:30Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "GasStop and RV Propane", "description": "GasStop is the only device on the market that automatically shuts 100% of propane in the event of a major leak, cut, or rupture in your propane system.\n\nGet your GasStop Propane Shutoff and other important RV safety devices at TechnoRV:  https://technorv.com/collections/propane-safety", "channelTitle": "TechnoRV", "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT3M10S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "projection": "rectangular"}, "status": {"uploadStatus": "processed", "privacyStatus": "public", "license": "youtube", "embeddable": true, "publicStatsViewable": true, "madeForKids": false}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "3280", "likeCount": "116", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "6"}}
{"id": "g8hNKywD828", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "qcRGsU1DrS9SVHl-oSi8_ZnudVQ", "transcript": "hey this is Eric over at technol RV and in this video I want to talk to you about the features of the TST tire pressure monitoring system 770 model if you're not familiar with what a tire pressure monitoring system is essentially you'll have a sensor that screws onto each valve stem on your RV and that will broadcast forward to the monitor that sits with you while you're driving and display your temperature and your pressure of each tire and if either one of those points of data gets out of spec then it will alarm you so oftentimes a blowout is preceded by low pressure and high temperature so if you can be alarmed of these conditions as they're starting to occur oftentimes these systems can prevent those blowouts give you time to get off the road to deal with whatever that situation is this is the 770 model and right out of the gate the the model that's always been the Workhorse for TST is the 507 model here and the first thing that you'll notice is that the 770 is a larger screen so this is a five inch screen and so from a visibility standpoint I think that you'll really like that in addition it's touch screen so you're basically just touching the screen and I have tested this out thoroughly and the touch screen is very sensitive and works very nicely to move from screen to screen this system is very user friendly first of all with the touch screen it makes it very user friendly but a lot of the functions that you perform in this quite honestly they've just made it easier with this 770 model like even programming sensors and things like that so let's talk about the features of the 770 this unit actually has a a GPS sensor in it now that's not for navigation purposes but by it having a GPS sensor in it it will give you your direction of travel which is nice to have your altitude and your speed and it's also got a resettable trip odometer in it so this is a nice addition that TST is added to the 770 model that I think that you'll really appreciate this 770 model can monitor up to five trailers uh the pre the the 507 model did up to four trailer so this one does up to five and let me stop real quick and and make sure that I'm clear here the 507 model will be sold alongside the 770 so this is not replacing the 507 it's just basically an upgrade and it will be a bit more expensive so you can choose either one on the 507 or the 770. um so let's get back into the to the features here as far as whenever you go to program your sensors again when you go into the screen you'll see that it has icons on the screen and you'll see one that just says Hey program sensors you click that and and quite honestly the 507 was easy to program but I used to do it all the time right so for somebody who had never done it before you know it would take them a bit of time to kind of get used to that with this model here whenever I got it I was actually able to go through and program sensors without even looking at the manual it was it was just that easy in addition setting parameters we always recommend that whatever your cold tire pressure is that you set your low pressure alert and your high pressure alert at 10 percent below your cold tire pressure and 25 percent above now on the 507 unit you used to have to go in there and do that calculation and manually enter that on this system basically you just enter what your cold tire pressure is and it automatically sets the 10 percent below and the 25 percent above now you can go in and manually adjust those if you like but having that already kind of pre-set up for you I find is is nice another nice feature about the 770 is that you know you're always wondering about your battery life in your sensors uh and while uh the 507 and the 770 uh will both alert you if you have low battery life a lot of times people put their RVs up for periods of time so maybe a battery dies during that period of time and so whenever you turn on your monitor you know the the time has already passed there's going to be no alert there right because it's not like it's going low it's already dead so it's not broadcasting anything with the 770 you can actually go and look at each sensor and see what the voltage is on each sensor so you'll know like at all times if you want to check periodically and see hey what is my voltage now we recommend you change your batteries and your sensors once a year just when you get ready for the new season we know people that that get longer out of that and that's that's fine but for me and what my recommendation is it's it's just once a year just go ahead and change them and then you kind of never have to worry about that another nice feature of the 770 is it's got a tire rotation feature in it so if you go to rotate your tires you need to make sure with the 507 system that your your sensor stays with that tire position now with the 770 you can rotate tires and then you can just move those tires in the system so the sensor can stay with that tire the tire moves and then you just move that tire in this system so that makes it a bit easier whenever you go get a tire rotation to make sure that in your TST system that you know your sensor is in the right location all of the TST systems come with a repeater and that's just increasing your signal strength from your sensor forward to your monitor to ensure that if you were to go through a rainstorm or a high electronic interference type area that you've always got good signal strength and uh and so when you get your system and you install you want to make sure you always install that repeater the uh the the 770s got a little icon on it uh that lights up whenever it recognizes that repeater uh so that you'll always know that the repeater is working uh and that you're getting that extra boost so if you were using like alligator clips or something like that on your battery and one of those were to come off then you know that icon would go away so I kind of like that as well this does have a rechargeable uh internal battery in it so you basically just charge it up it's now got a USB C connection so you get a really quick charge with these on it and so I kind of like that upgrade with that USBC I like that type of connection the 770 does uh come with that the 770s got a a nice Mount that comes with it it comes with this suction cup mount that a lot of people are used to that you can suction cup it to uh you know your your window or if you've got a dash pad or something like that you can do that but it now comes with a magnetic mount a lot of GPS systems these days are using the magnetic mounts and we we love them on RGB GPS unit because you can easily take them on and off but as you can see it just it just snaps on and then you can just snap it right off so if you wanted to pull that off without having to take the suction cup off the window you can easily do that with that magnetic Mount and in addition it it will work with if you have a particular phone mount or something like that that's got a magnetic connection then it would work with that if you wanted to use that but it does come with that magnetic Mount which I find to be a nice feature so that is the features of the TST tire pressure monitoring system 7 170 model you can get these over at technorv.com and if you've got more questions we're always available to help you make your decisions at techno RV you can always call chat or email with us we appreciate it and we wish you safe

{"id": "mJJkUjZRGX4", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "UNsELJ5M6rxZjGvimeqhTbi4jBo", "transcript": "hey this is Eric over at techno RV and in this video I want to tell you everything that you need to know about the latest Max br1 Mini by pep wave and the newest model has a cat 7 modem in it that's exciting uh for a lot of reasons and the two main reasons is number one for you T-Mobile users out there cat7 will pick up the elusive band 71 uh and so that's exciting news in addition uh to that the upload speeds have been improved on this as well so again in this video I want to tell you everything you need to know about its features and then we'll go into the box and kind of see what you get in here so let's just go ahead first and talk about theoretical speeds on this unit right here and like I said they have increased the upload speeds quite dramatically over the uh Cat6 model br1 Mini Max because that model had 50 megabits per second upload and this one has a 150 megabits per second uh upload speed so it's 300 megabits per second download that this can handle and 150 megabits per second uh upload on this so quite a lot of power typically your limiting factor on speeds are going to be your cell plan or what the particular cell tower is even able to provide to you if you're looking for a unit that has faster speeds then we do have uh cat 20 LTE models we also have 5G models and we also have dual modems that have a cat 7 and a cat 12 modem in them and those will all produce higher theoretical speeds this unit will cover all of your carriers so we're talking a t Verizon the old Sprint stuff and T-Mobile it'll also cover your Canadian carriers like Rogers and bell and tell us uh and it's going to cover all of your updated bands that you could possibly want from any of these carriers including T-Mobile and that band 71. if you want to take a look at all of the listed bands for the carriers you can always go to technorv.com on the product pages and have a look at that so now we've talked about speed I want to talk about something called carrier aggregation because that's actually something a feature that actually helps you get better speeds carrier aggregation is something that actually just allows you to have access to multiple carrier bands at the same time so imagine a cell tower has say five six seven different bands that you can access but let's say your device can only access one of those bands and let's say that band is completely congested at the time that you were trying to access it so you would have a bad experience when you have uh aggregation multiple aggregation then that means you can access more than one band at a time and so this unit right here is two times aggregation which means that it can connect to two bands at the same time so even if one band was congested it's going to connect to another if that band is is nice and clean then even though somebody that can only connect to that one band would have a bad experience because you had two bands you would have a much better experience because of that aggregation we've already talked a little bit about Wi-Fi has Wan and so this unit is Dual Band Wi-Fi AP and Wi-Fi as when let's get the Wi-Fi AP out of the way first uh eight the AP is basically your device like your smartphone wirelessly connecting to this device so this this device is going to have cellular service coming in and then you'll need to connect wirelessly to this device so because it's dual band you'll be able to do that with either 2.4 gigahertz or five gigahertz so most smartphones these days are doing dual bands so it's nice that this also will do that the Wi-Fi is when is also dual band 2.4 and 5 that means this device connecting to say the RV part that may have uh Wi-Fi and if they have dual band for you to access this will be able to do that now I want to make it very clear that out of the box these Max br1 Minis you don't have access to that Wi-Fi is when unless you buy a failover license once you buy the failover license it's a one-time fee then it opens up that Wi-Fi is when uh and the WAN port on the back which is basically hard lining in a uh internet connection when you buy that failover license it will basically open those up and activate and that's a one-time fee and that's for life so out of the box you don't have Wi-Fi as Wan but when you get the failover license it opens it all up okay and then you'll have dual band from there um so anyway that's a good thing that they offer that dual band and most people that get this unit they do go ahead and get the failover license because it's a one-time thing and you just buy it and get it over with so the max br1 mini does use memo antenna technology for its Wireless communication Nemo is means multiple in multiple out antennas so basically using multiple antennas for your communication uh to the say the cell tower so if you have multiple antennas on your end and there's multiple antennas on the transmitter side then basically those antennas at each end of the circuit are combined to minimize errors in that communication to make it a much cleaner communication and by doing that it can increase and improve the performance of that Cellular Connection and optimize speeds as well so that's a good thing everybody is concerned about security because you may be sending sensitive information via Cellular Connection and so you'll be glad to know that pep wave utilizes VPN technology with its transmission and basically what it does is whenever you're transmitting information it breaks that transmission down the data into very small pieces I'm just talking from a high level here so it's going to break that transmission down into very small pieces and then each of those small pieces is going to be coated with military grade encryption so each individual piece uh you know is not enough to make up the whole picture anyway and then those individual pieces are highly encrypted so pep wave has always been known for its security because of the measures that they take to ensure that your Transmissions are secure and safe and so that's basically how they do it and that's uh that's across all the pep wave products but it is also the case in the br1 Max Mini hey before we move on to the open box portion of this video I want to talk to you just real quickly about why you would buy your pep way from techno RV and there's just a few quick reasons I want to review one pricing is always a concern for a consumer and we will always have the lowest price pep wave has minimum pricing guidelines for all of its certified manufacturers we are a certified pep wave dealer and so they say hey here's the lowest you can sell it at and we always sell at that lowest price now if you happen to find somebody that was going below with the manufacturer allows uh then you can always call us and we will always match that from a certified dealer so uh price always going to be the lowest at techno RV and then probably the most important thing is our support uh we have built our entire business on uh great support we have agents that are highly trained in pep wave and I guess what sets us apart from everybody else is that not only do we have email live chat but I believe that we're the only uh people in the market that actually do good old-fashioned phone support and so uh that's important because you know you may have questions you may want somebody just kind of walk you through something and if you're the type person that every now and again just wants to pick up the phone and talk to somebody then we're going to give that for you in addition it's free we don't charge you for anything for our support uh we never charge you for that so free support is a big deal when you order from us you're going to get the Techno RV learning series which is going to uh is documents and videos that we walk you through how to work your unit and get it all set up we're always going to make sure you're successful with your unit that's the bottom line so when you're paying this kind of money for a device you want to make sure that you have that support and that somebody's going to be there for you and techno RV will absolutely be there for you so let's get back into the open box portion of this all right to save us a little time I went ahead and unloaded the Box because I want to make sure that you know what's in here and we're going to talk about all the ports on the max br1 mini as well so when you get it get your box of course you've got your main unit here and you're also going to get two cellular antennas uh which I'm sorry are actually here and you're going to get two Wi-Fi antennas as well because remember we have the 2.4 and the five gigahertz Wi-Fi channels on this in addition uh they upgraded this unit from the older units from a barrel style connection for your power supply to the four pin Molex connection which actually kind of snaps in there so that is an upgrade and this unit comes with an AC power supply with the Molex 4 pin on the end when you buy from techno RV we also Supply you and this is an exclusive thing when you buy from us is we give you another power supply that just comes with this for the same cost a cigarette lighter style 12 volt plug to the Molex so if you wanted to run it from 12 volt then you would have the ability to do that in addition it does have the GPS receiver here as well and this is basically just sort of tracking where this where this unit is you don't have to connect it if you don't want to but it is there for you if you would like to do that and then they give you some velcro tape to help you sort of manage the wires in a cabinet or what have you uh so let's go ahead and talk about what you get on this unit as it relates to Ports you do have three Lan ports out of the box you're getting three Lan ports land is basically a hard wire ethernet connection going from this device to say your laptop okay so instead of you wirelessly connecting to this you can hardwire uh to that so a lot of people just wirelessly connect but if you're doing a lot of business or uh and you just want that little extra Assurance then a lot of times hardwire is the way to go but most people don't do that they're typically Wireless now one of these ports uh can be converted to a Wan port and if you'll remember whenever I said that if you're going to get the Wi-Fi as when so that you can say connect this unit to a RV Park's Wi-Fi then you have to buy that failover license once you buy that then it this Wan Port right here or I'm sorry this Lan Port can be converted to a Wan Port which is basically a hard line coming in now you can use that for uh if you happen to be somewhere where you've got a Hardline DSL cable or maybe you're even using like a starlink type thing you can plug that directly into here and then this will be managing your cellular Plans uh your your cable DSL starlink whatever it can all be managed from the pep wave so that is very nice there as far as your ports here you're going to have your two Wi-Fi uh typical SMA Type connections here and then you're going to have your two antenna ports for your cellular and Tennis to screw in the back and then in the middle here you've got your your GPS connection here if you wanted to use that now you do have a SIM slot here this takes a nano SIM that's the smallest size and this has the dust cover on it right now but you would basically take that screw out to where you could see the two SIM ports so it can take two uh SIM cards but it's only using one at a time because this is a single modem right but if you had say a a t and a Verizon or a T-Mobile you could put both of those cards in here and then from the console uh you can manage how you want to use those designate which one you want to use in certain circumstances and so we really like it because we can just put them in there and kind of forget about that part of it and then manage everything from the console so you do need to supply your own data plan so this is just the Hub that gets everything done but you do need a data plan and techno RV does have data plans and you can check them out on our website at techno rv.com we're very proud that we have negotiated contracts with the carriers like directly with the carriers this is not any of this third-party business that you you read about that you know people are getting cut off and things like that we went straight to the carriers negotiated exclusive contracts with them and you can when you get your pep way from us you can just go ahead and pick your data card up as well now this unit does come with one year of prime care and basically Prime Care is going to give you your your one year warranty it's going to give you one year of in control two which is the platform to manage this system say from a desktop or a laptop it's going to do all your software updates and then it'll also give you you access to speed Fusion I've got another video where I talk a little bit more about those different features and what speed Fusion is speed Fusion on this model really isn't going to do you a whole lot of good unless you get that failover license because part of speed Fusion is is something called hot failover and if you don't have the Wi-Fi as when you know on this from buying that failover license then you don't have anything to fail over to so if your cellular went out hot failover would automatically jump to another service like Wi-Fi so if you don't get the failover license then that really doesn't do you any good but anyway there's some other features of speed Fusion that again with this unit right here really only do you some good if you go ahead and get that failover license and again most people that buy this unit do go ahead and get the uh the failover license so that's it that's everything that you need to know about the max br1 mini if you need more information or assistance you know we're always here for you at techno RV you can call us you can live chat with us or you can email us at info technorv.com we want to help you make the

{"id": "DEAlGgBJGg4", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "WFytGYlGfy_BTpsJe1MWhWgHN-0", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and in this video i want to give a comparison of our current pep wave lineup now i'm a full-time rver and i've been running my business from the road for a long time and over those years i know what needs to uh what units are best for different rvers based on what their needs are some people are just you know wanting to you know stream some video or stay connected with family through email surf a little internet and some people are running full-blown businesses one of these units will meet your needs regardless of what those needs are and the the reason that we brought this these units down to just four is because pep wave has more units but there's a lot of duplications with them and it just creates a lot of confusion so we have curated these to avoid that confusion and just know that whatever your needs are one of these will certainly cover that so today we're going to talk about the single modem max br1 mini this is a category 7 unit here this unit here is the max transit pro this is a dual modem so it has two modems in it a cat 7 and a cat 12 modem this is the max br1 pro this is the cat 20 lte model and then this one is the max br1 pro 5 g model so you can get the prices for obviously there's different price levels on these and you can get the prices for all of these at techno rv.com if you want to hop over there and check that out all right let's talk about the uh category levels here in these units and what that means as it relates to speeds uh this is a category 7 this max br1 mini over here it's a category 7 modem and when we talk about theoretical speeds these are like laboratory condition speeds that these are capable of that's not real world but it does give you uh you know the ability to see that these units can handle a lot typically your limiting factor will be your cell plan or the cell tower even having the ability to give you the bandwidth that these units can handle but it is good to know at least what their theoretical speeds are and again this cat 7 right here has a the theoretical speed of 300 megabits per second download speed and 150 megabits per second upload speed so very respectable on the cat 7 there and uh being our lowest cost model uh for those that are just looking to search some internet maybe you know stream a little video nothing nothing too intense uh you know this is going to be a great model if you're running a full-blown business this probably ain't going to be be the model for you the next one is the max transit duo so this is going to have dual modems in it which means that it can take multiple cellular cards in different modems to where you can go back and forth between those very quickly and so the category 7 side of this the theoretical speed is 300 megabits per second download and 150 megabits per second upload and the category 12 side of this modem is 600 megabits per second on the download side and 150 megabits per second on the upload side uh plenty of power and more than enough for most uh this is the uh cat 20 4g lte model right here and its theoretical speeds are two gigabits per second on the uh on the download side and 150 megabits per second on the upload side this is the 5g model and it's theoretical speeds on the on the download side or 4 gigabits per second on the download and 700 on the upload again theoretical speeds but that just kind of gives you an idea here of kind of what we're dealing with and again your limiting factor is rarely ever going to be the pep wave especially when you start getting up into these models uh you're not going to find a cell tower that's even going to provide that but this does offer you some future proofing as technology improves these pep wave units will be prepared for that let's talk real quick about something called carrier aggregation and basically that is just the ability for these units to connect to more than one cellular band at one time so if you were only able to connect to one band uh in a cellular band at a time because a cell tower could you know have many many bands available but if you could only connect to one and that was congested you would have a bad experience but if you could connect to multiple bands at the same time then you would have a much better experience because while one might be congested another might not be so you're on the same cell tower but because you have carrier aggregation you're having a better better experience than someone that does not have that so basically when we talk about this it's in relation to how many bands can these units connect to at one time so on the uh cat 7 mini down here it can connect to uh two bands at a time on the uh duo model here on the cat seven side of this it's it's again two times on the cat 12 it's three times carrier aggregation on download and two times carrier aggregation on the upload on your 4g cat 20 modem here it can do five times carrier aggregation on the downloads that's five bands and three on the upload and the 5g is also five down and three up so that is is carrier aggregation and kind of what it means and how it works and having that ability in these pep wave units can improve your experience quite a bit all of these units uh cover all of the carriers including att verizon the old sprint stuff t-mobile even your canadian carriers like rogers and bell and telus and it's gonna cover all of your updated uh bands uh including t-mobile's band 71 a lot of people uh with with t-mobile are concerned about doesn't cover band 71 every one of these units covers band 71 so all your carriers um you know again all of your bands that you would expect if you're interested in seeing like all of the bands specifically you can go to technorv.com and go to the product pages on these and read through those individually uh so uh all of these units are capable uh dual band wi-fi ap and dual band wi-fi is when dual the the wi-fi ap is me connecting my device like my smartphone connecting that to this device so my smartphone can connect in 2.4 gigahertz or 5 gigahertz and these pep waves can can do that as well right so that's me connecting to this the wi-fi as well as these units connect into the rv parks wi-fi system uh and it can also do that in dual bands so if a park you're at has 2.4 and five gigahertz then these units will do that i do want to talk about one small point that i need to bring up here is that your your duo and your uh pro your pro 5g and your cat 20 out of the box they have the wi-fi as well nothing you need to do there this the br1 pro mini has the capability to do it but it's not fired up out of the box to be able to do it so you'll have the option to purchase what's called a failover license it's a one-time purchase and once you purchase that then it opens up the wi-fi is wan and the the ethernet port that's the win on this unit as well so if you don't buy the failover license then on the cat 7 you actually don't have wi-fi as wan or the the ethernet port uh wan either most people almost all buy the failover license whenever they get this unit right here so all these other ones that's out of the box you get it you don't have to buy a failover license but anyway i wanted to explain that for you another thing as it relates to the wi-fi is that the br1 mini uses wi-fi 5 technology and the pro and the 2br1 pros use wi-fi 6 technology all good but wi-fi 6 is the newer wi-fi technology it offers better range faster ability for downloads and upload speeds uh works a bit better in congested areas and it's just a more efficient chipset so wi-fi six from here down and then uh don't mean to pick on the br one mini here because it is a great unit but it is using the wi-fi 5 technology i know security is important for everyone as you transmit sensitive data and bring sensitive data in and pepwave is known for its high levels of security they do use vpn technology and from a high level maybe more of a simplistic way to explain this is when you're transferring data with one of these pep wave devices they break that uh piece of data down into very small pieces to where one individual piece would not show the whole picture of the data that is sent then those individual pieces are then coded with military grade encryption and so you know it's it's basically they have sort of refined the the art of internet security with this uh method and i've been using a pepway for many many years running my company from the road transmitting sensitive data a lot and i have never had a concern with the pep waves ability to protect that information now when you get one of these units from techno rv in the box you're going to get everything you need to fire this unit up right so you're going to get all of your antennas you're going to get your power supply and all pep waves have moved to the 4-pin molex connection instead of the barrel style that they used to use so that's an improvement and with any one of these units when you get it from techno rv we're gonna send you at no extra cost a a power supply that is a cigarette lighter style plug for 12 volt to that 4-pin molex connection that comes on these pep waves so you'll have the ac power plug that comes with this when you get it from us we're also going to send you that dc power supply to connect to a cigarette lighter style plug if you want to use uh 12 volt so a lot of different uh power options there when you get it from techno rv also in addition all of these units are using nano sim cards that is the smallest sim card that you can get and you have to provide your data plan with that sim card when you get the pep wave now techno rv sales data plans and we're very proud of them because we went out and negotiated deals directly with the carriers a lot of times you'll see people that are working for third-party uh people and and you know you can see we see and read all kinds of problems that that may arise from that and we made the decision early on that we're only going to deal with carriers directly we'll we'll negotiate exclusive contracts we'll have great pricing and that's exactly what we've done so when you're looking at your pep wave go look at our data plans as well and you can go ahead and pick all that up all of these units do include a year of pep waves prime care and what that includes is a one-year warranty it includes your one-year access to their in control to system which is their platform to operate these systems remotely from say a computer customers fall in love with this in control 2 system because it makes operating and making changes to these systems very very easy it also provides your software any software updates and it also provides uh speed fusion um i'm not getting into speed fusion right now because uh i've made another video that gets into the different aspect of that suite of basically products that you get it's it's includes hot failover something called wand smoothing and something called bonding again you can check that other video out that i made that i talked specifically about what all that means a lot of those services are great for people that are maybe needing unbreakable connectivity because maybe they take a lot of zoom calls or skype calls and these suite of services really like make sure you have unbreakable connectivity so they really are great uh now i will say that on the the max br1 mini the the suite of speed fusion products is really not applicable if you don't get that failover license to activate the wi-fi as when because if you didn't have you know the wi-fi is when for example on the failover uh product or service there would be nothing to fail over to because you would have a cellular connection so the hot failover is basically when one if one service fails it automatically goes to the other one again on the cat 7 if you didn't get the that license then there's nothing to fail over to so it still gets the speed fusion suite of products but really only applicable if you get that failover license so that is it that is a the overview of these units if you have any other questions at techno rv we we have people answering our phones that are highly knowledgeable in these units and we're here to help you you can email us you can live chat with us and yes we do have old fashioned just pick up the phone and call us and we'd be happy to talk to you about these units so i hope that this comparison video has been helpful", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2022-08-06T15:37:33Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "Pepwave Cellular Router Comparison", "description": "Shop the Pepwave

{"id": "sUNghWwvyR0", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "rSOHOJPCQVyxstPToCL_qufwQHM", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and in this video i want to tell you everything you need to know about the max br1 pro 5g pep wave and the max br1 pro cat 20 lte model and the reason i've only got one unit out here is because the form factor on both of these units is exactly the same so a bit a little bit later in this video we'll be talking about all of the ports and the antenna connections here and so just know that this form factor is the same for both of these but the obvious question out of the box here is that one is 5g that is also backwards compatible to the 4g lte and then one is just the 4g lte model and does not connect to the 5g networks if you're looking to completely future proof yourself then you know the 5g model is the way that you would want to go however the 5g network continues to evolve and it's you know honestly the 5g network doesn't do you much good in rural areas and the 4g lte network is the one we've been using for quite some time now and we've all been rather happy with it so um the uh 4g lte you might be asking well when when is that just going to completely phase out and then it'll be you know just like nothing but 5g and i don't have a crystal ball on that but i've done a bit of reading from the experts and everything that i see the 4g lte network should be around for another 5-10 years likely longer than you would you would even uh have your device or want to switch out for another one anyway this decision for you may very well come down to a if you're if you're the type that's like that i just want a future proof i don't care about that it costs more give me the 5g then your decisions made if you want to save uh some money and and then you would you would get the 4g cat 24g lte model and that is going to be a great unit and it is going to be in most cases more than you would ever need anyway uh with that said let's move on and just talk about the specifics of these models and uh and then we'll start talking about uh what you get in these boxes okay let's start off by talking about uh the the compatibility with both of these units with the cell carriers and there is really no concern here all the all the major cell carriers so we're talking a t verizon the you know the old sprint stuff t-mobile even your canadian suppliers rogers bell and telus and it is going to also be able to connect with all of the updated bands that you know and love including ut mobile users out there uh that are interested in the ever elusive band 71 uh either one of these units will connect to that uh just fine so just know that on on all the all the you know the bands and the carriers you're good and if you do want to look at just a list of the bands you can always take a peek at that over at technorv.com on the product pages let's talk about speeds both of these units have one gig throughput but when we talk about theoretical speeds uh this is more of laboratory type speeds that can be attained in a laboratory so it's just like what this unit can handle what this unit can handle is highly uh it's highly unlikely that that you would ever get this out in the real world but not because of the pep wave your limiting factors will typically be your cell plan uh and the cell towers that you're connecting to are are not going to be able to give you the speeds that these pep waves can handle so as it relates to the future and cell towers getting better and things like that you have a ton of head room on the pep wave on the cat 20 4g lte side uh the the theoretical speeds on this are two gigabits per second on the download side and 150 megabits per second on the upload side and on the the 5g model uh it has capability of uh two gigabits per second on the download side and 700 megabits per second on the upload side i've never ever ran a speed test and gotten anything near what this this can handle either one of these so in my mind i really look at that like hey i've got a system that can handle whatever the future can throw at it um as it relates to speed it's gonna be more than you're you're likely ever gonna need what this can handle uh while we're talking about speeds let's go ahead and talk about carrier aggregation and it has the ability of these units to connect to multiple cellular bands at the same time to bring you a better experience if you were only able to connect to say one band that a cellular tower provided and that cellular band was congested then you would have a poor experience but if you have a unit that can connect to multiple bands then you're going to have a better experience because it will be able to connect to bands that aren't as congested and so both of these units uh have five times uh carrier aggregation on the uh on the download side and three times carrier aggregation on the upload side so basically what this means is that it it can on the download side it can connect to five different bands now this is huge um as it relates to optimizing performance and speeds giving you a better experience and uh five times carrier aggregation is amazing and both of these units have that so uh this unit just before we get into more specifics i just want to talk about the measurements on this this unit measures 5.8 by 5 inches by 1.6 inches so it's its form is quite uh compact and anytime an rver can get something that is compact that is a good thing let's talk about wi-fi and this is going to be us connecting with this unit to say a uh rv parks access point maybe you pull into an rv park and they have wi-fi both of these units are dual wi-fi ap and dual wi-fi as when let's talk about the wi-fi ap first that means that with my device say a cell phone or a computer that's me connecting to this wirelessly and that can be done with either 2.4 gigahertz or 5 gigahertz bands uh and and you know the newer smartphones and things like that they're dual band as well so it's great that the pep wave is dual band on the wi-fi is wan part that's this pep wave now connecting to the rv parks wi-fi system and if the rv park that you're in has 2.4 and 5 this is also dual band and can connect to that just fine this also uses both of these models use uh wi-fi six technology and that is uh well quite honestly it's better than wi-fi uh five technology it's gonna give you faster um download and upload speeds it's going to give you better range it's going to operate better in congested areas and quite honestly the wi-fi 6 is just a more efficient chipset so all good on the wi-fi side this uses memo technology from an antenna standpoint memo means multiple in multiple out and essentially what this is is that when you're connecting your your transmission from you to you know the the cell tower by doing that with multiple antennas on the transmit and receive side those multiple antennas can connect and provide a much cleaner uh pathway and it can omit errors in that communication and by omitting those errors it can optimize your data speed so memos a good thing anytime you hear that it's good and the both of these pep wave units do utilize that as it relates to security i know that's important to everyone because you may be transmitting sensitive information and or you know bringing in sensitive information so pep wave utilizes vpn technology and from a very high level simplicity uh type way to explain this is whenever you're transmitting data that data is is chopped up into very very small pieces to where no one piece of information creates the picture of the of the whole then those tiny bits of information are coded with military-grade encryption so you've got these tiny bits of information they're totally encrypted and so for someone to hack that information would be nearly impossible so uh i have been using pepway for a long time and quite honestly running uh this business and constantly sending sensitive information i never have any reservations for that whenever i'm using the pep wave hey before we move on to the open box portion of this video i want to talk to you just real quickly about why you would buy your pep way from techno rv and there's just a few quick reasons i want to review one pricing is always a concern for a consumer and we will always have the lowest price pep wave has minimum pricing guidelines for all of its certified manufacturers we are a certified pepway dealer and so they say hey here's the lowest you can sell it at and we always sell at that lowest price now if you happen to find somebody that was going below what the manufacturer allows then you can always call us and we will always uh match that from a certified dealer so price always going to be the lowest at techno rv and then probably the most important thing is our support we have built our entire business on great support we have agents that are highly trained in pep wave and i guess what sets us apart from everybody else is that not only do we have email live chat but i believe that we're the only uh people in the market that actually do good old-fashioned phone support and so that's important because you know you may have questions you may want somebody just kind of walk you through something and if you're the type person that every now and again just wants to pick up the phone and talk to somebody then we're going to give that for you in addition it's free we don't charge you for anything for our support uh we never charge you for that so free support is a big deal when you order from us you're going to get the techno rv learning series which is going to uh is documents and videos that we walk you through how to uh work your unit and get it all set up we're always going to make sure you're successful with your unit that's the bottom line so when you're paying this kind of money for a device you want to make sure that you have that support and that somebody's going to be there for you and techno rv will absolutely be there for you so let's get back into the open box portion of this to save us a little time i went ahead and pulled everything out of the box here i want to show you everything that you get here uh pep wave packages these up very nicely i'm highly impressed with their packaging but let's go ahead and get through this of course you get your main uh head unit here when you uh purchase this in addition you'll get uh two wi-fi antennas internal antennas that will screw onto this unit you will get four cellular antennas and uh remember you're getting those those multiple antennas so you'll have um four of those and then you'll have the gps receiver and this basically connects to this device it is optional that you use this but this will track uh this device here so uh some people use it some people don't as far as powering this unit pepwave has gone to a 4-pin molex connection for all of its newer units and i really like this over the barrel connections because this actually kind of snaps in place one the one you get with this unit is a wall plug ac power supply when you buy from techno rv this is kind of exclusive when you buy from us we include no extra charge a 12 volt cigarette lighter style plug to the 4-pin molex so if you're wanting to operate this off your 12-volt system you will have that cigarette lighter style plug that you can do that with and again we don't charge for that we just include it with this system in addition you're going to get some velcro tape here to help you with your uh cables and your installation to kind of clean that process up what i want to do now is just talk about each side of this unit and kind of what we're looking at here so remember we talked about we had the two wi-fi antennas so we'll just start on this side the two wi-fi antennas you'll have your uh molex uh power uh where you're gonna plug in your ac power supply or that cigarette lighter style plug we're gonna send you that'll plug in here and then you have two lan ports and one lan port now your wan port would be if you're going to hard wire say a cable or dsl line i mean a lot of rvers don't have access to this when you're traveling typically you don't have a hard line like cable connection that you can plug into this but if you did then you do have that wind connection to do that uh if you're testing out like the the star link um that some people are talking about this system will manage all your cellular connections your starlink connections so you would just plug that into the wan port there you get two lan ports now the lan port is a more of an out to your like one of your devices like you're just a laptop and so you get two of those so sometimes uh you know especially people that are are working and need to do everything that they can to have the best connection uh you know hard wire is the safer way to go over a wireless connection although most people just wirelessly connect that's what i do but the lan connections are there you get two of them also that wan connection is assignable so most of the time you're not going to have a hard line that you can even plug into this so you can assign that lan port to be a lan port and if you did that you'd have you'd have three lan ports there let's flip over to the other side of course uh as i mentioned you're gonna have four cellular antennas they're just going to plug in uh here and then you're going to have that gps connection over here up underneath this dust cover is and i'll i'll show you what that looks like under the dust cover that's where your sim card is going to go it does take a nano sim card you can put two sim cards in here now the these units are single modems so it would only be using one sim at a time but if you had a verizon and a t or a t-mobile if you had multiple plans you could put them both in there and then manage both of those plans from this device but again they are nano so the pep wave does all the work for you but you do need to supply your own data plan and techno rv does provide data plans so when you buy this unit from us you should look at our data plans as well because we made exclusive agreements with the carriers we did not go to third-party suppliers that you you kind of hear that there's there's problems with we went directly to the carriers set up meetings um negotiated some exclusive contracts and they are spectacular so you should have a look at those for your data plans when you buy our pe your pep way from us and so anyway that is sort of the form factor on this unit right here and so uh the other thing that i want to mention as it relates to [Music] antennas is these are all the inside antennas some people opt to use an outside antenna and you can totally do that with this uh we sell them at techno rv as well and so this would be line of sights very important for wi-fi cellular most people know that but obviously having an antenna outside up high is going to perform better than antennas that are inside i love these inside antennas but most people do opt to get an outside antenna and i've actually got one myself but the uh antennas that we recommend for this are the um the for the mobility 42 g and the pointing seven and one antenna so you would basically have that antenna up and the cables would come inside and connect to this instead of these inside antennas here uh both of the units that we're talking about the 5g and the cat24g lte do come with prime care and what prime care is going to give you is it's going to give you your one year warranty it's going to give you one year of the in control ii platform which is basically allows you to control this system remotely from say a laptop customers fall in love with the in control too because it just makes things so much easier to just operate this thing remotely so you get that you get all your software updates and then you also get speed fusion now after a year it'll expire or you can re-up it for another year uh i would say 99.9 percent of customers just re-up it every year and you can re-up it uh with us at techno rv and when you do that it also just you know extend your warranty for another year and gives you all those other services for another year and you just keep doing that also with prime care you do get the speed fusion suite of services and basically that includes hot failover wand smoothing and bonding i made another video on what all those are and you can go check that out because i don't want to get into all that here while i'm talking about this unit but essentially those suite of services are something that is very attractive to people that need unbreakable connectivity typically people that are are working need you know they're doing uh zoom calls and skype and they're like i i can't have my connection break and uh those suite of services um basically give you this unbreakable connection it's it's it's very awesome so you can check that other video out to uh for an explanation on kind of how all that works so that's it that's uh everything that you need to know about the 5g and the 4g lte max br1 pro if you have more questions we are always here for you at techno rv it is our business model to take care of you so you can call us live chat or email with us whichever you prefer and if you ever have any more questions then feel free to do that and i hope that this video has been helpful to you", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2022-08-06T15:37:23Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "Pepwave BR1 PRO LTE and 5G Cellular Routers", "description": "Shop the Pepwave BR1 PRO LTE and 5G Routers here:  https://www.technorv.com/cellular-routers/\n\nSingle Cell Modem\n The Max BR1 Pro 5G has a single 5G cellular modem that also supports Cat 20 4G LTE-A.  The Max BR1 Pro LTE Cat 20 has a single cellular modem that supports Cat 20 4G LTE-A. This means you can only use one SIM card (cellular plan) at a time to access the internet. \nNote: This unit takes the smallest \"Nano\" SIM cards. If you have existing SIM cards are larger, check with your carriers about exchanging for a Nano SIMs.\n\nDual Sim Card Slots\nAlthough the Max BR1 Pro LTE and 5G have one cellular modem, it allows you to use 2 SIM cards (cellular plans) in the one modem and switch between the two plans as needed. This allows for the redundancy often needed to stay connected while on the road.  You can also set limits and rules for when you want to use one cell plan over the other which is a great feature when you are trying to conserve one plan and only use it as a backup. You are not using both cell plans at the same time with this router; however, there are routers available that allow you to use 2 SIM cards at the same time which will improve your connectivity. (See the Max Transit DUO Cat 6 and Cat 12 routers.)\n\nWiFi as WAN Capabilities \nThe Max BR1 Pro LTE and 5G has WiFi as WAN capabilities which means you can use it to access campground WiFi using 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. \n\nSupports All Major Carrier Networks\nUS Carriers: AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon and US Cellular \nInternational Carriers: Rogers, TELUS, and Bell\n\nSupports Carrier Aggregation \nThe Max BR1 Pro LTE and 5G supports Carrier Aggregation (CA), which means it has the ability to connect to up to 8 cellular bands (from the same plan) at the same time, though realistically you may only see a max of 4 bands being used at one time. By combining more than one cellular band together, it is possible to increase the bandwidth available. Traditional hotspots and phones are usually only able to connect to one cellular band and the tower selects which band you are using. With the Max BR1 Pro, you can choose which primary band you want to use (the tower selects the second), which allows you to avoid the crowded primary band used by phones and hotspots.\n\nIncreased Throughput and Speeds\nBecause of Carrier Aggregation, the Max BR1 Pro 5G has higher throughput and speeds than your traditional cellular router or hotspot.\nThe Max BR1 Pro 5G has the following theoretical speeds:\n5G: 4 Gbps download and 700 Mbps upload\nLTE CAT-20: 2 Gbps download and 150 Mbps upload\nReal world speeds will be less than theoretical speeds.\n \nKIT CONTENTS:\nPepwave MAX BR1 Pro Router\n1 - Molex 4-pin AC Wall-Style Power Supply\n1 - Molex 4-pin Cigarette Lighter Style 12V Power Supply\n1 - GPS Antenna\n2 - WiFi Antenna (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz)\n4 - 5dBi LTE/5G Antennas", "channelTitle": "TechnoRV", "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT19M51S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "projection": "rectangular"}, "status": {"uploadStatus": "processed", "privacyStatus": "public", "license": "youtube", "embeddable": true, "publicStatsViewable": true, "madeForKids": false}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "6222", "likeCount": "120", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "13"}}
{"id": "Za6eS735I6k", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "VhCdJnEG2kd7UIk14_0SNrrkKZk", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and in this video i want to tell you everything that you need to know about the pep wave dual modem it's a cat 7 slash cat 12 modem we're going to talk about its features and then we're going to dig into this box and show you what all you get with this this is their dual modem flagship model it is a rebuild from their older model the dual cat 12 system and it does have a faster processor and again instead of two cat 12 modems you get a cat 7 and a cat 12 and i feel like i need to explain why that's better it is better because it's going to give you more flexibility across the carriers and across the bands from the carriers so the cat 7 and that the cat just means category typically what they did in the past is they would say hey here's a cat six and you know here's a cat 12 and each new category level was a higher number oddly enough the cat 7 actually came out after the cat 12 so it's actually a newer version than that and basically what it does for those t-mobile users out there is cat 7 allows you to access the elusive band 71 so as it relates to verizon a t and t t mobile having a cat 7 and a cat 12 modem in one unit it kind of covers it all so that is what makes it spectacular and so i want to go ahead and start getting into the details about this unit with you so the first thing that you need to know is that this is good we've already talked about some of the carriage but it is good with all the carriers your your att your verizon the old sprint stuff t-mobile including uh band 71 uh and also uh canadian uh cellular providers like rogers bell and telus and it's gonna have all of your your updated bands for all of these and that's kind of the beauty of this this dual cat 7 cat 12 is that you're kind of getting the the best of of both worlds there as it relates to uh speeds there's plenty of speeds with this that it can handle and typically what we'll do is we'll talk about theoretical speeds like what can this handle in the laboratory and we do that just to say hey this is going to be able to handle anything you can throw at it right because the real world you're not going to get speeds like you can in the laboratory but this unit can handle that and so that's why we talk in theoretical speed so on the uh on the cat 7 side of this modem you're going to have speeds up to 300 megabits per second on the uh on the download side and you're going to have 150 megabits per second on the upload side on the cat 12 side of this modem you're going to have 600 megabits per second um capabilities on the download and 150 megabits per second on the upload again in most cases uh your limiting factor will typically be you know potentially your cell plan or the cell tower that you're connected to that will be your limiting factor on what you can get pepwave just kind of likes to have a scenario where your limiting factor isn't the pep wave and you'll have a lot of headroom with this unit here with those theoretical speeds so let's talk about something called carrier aggregation and i like to talk about this right around the same time i'm talking about speeds because carrier aggregation is basically the ability of the unit to connect to multiple cellular bands at the same time to help improve your performance so most cell towers will you know they'll have multiple bands that you can connect to and your device will you know if it can only connect to one band uh and that band happens to be congested you might not be having a great experience but if you have a device that can say connect to two uh bands uh then all of a sudden you're you're on the same cell tower but you're having a much better experience because of that so on the category seven side of this the uh it has two times carrier aggregation which means that it can connect to two cellular bands at the same time and on the cat 12 or yeah on the cat 12 side of this it is three times carrier aggregation on the download and two times carrier aggregation on the upload side so carrier aggregation is a great thing uh it work it's it's just happening for you and the in the in the console on operating this unit you you do have the ability to uh manual make manual adjustments on the different bands and things like that so there's a lot of flexibility with this unit as it relates to bands as well before we get into uh more of the capabilities let's just talk about the measurements on this unit here it does measure 6.3 inches across 3.8 inches wide and it is 1.3 inches tall so it's quite compact and that is a good thing for our viewers of course so let's get into a wi-fi and that would be this unit say connecting to an rv park that has wi-fi access points that you can connect to this does have dual band wi-fi ap and wi-fi as well the wi-fi ap dual band just means that's like your smartphone or or a computer or whatever is is will be wirelessly connecting to this device and it can do that with either the 2.4 wi-fi band or the 5 gigahertz wi-fi band so that's the wi-fi ap the wi-fi is when that is this unit connecting to the say the rv parks system and if they have 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz wi-fi then this unit will be able to connect to that this unit is using wi-fi six technology and uh that is an improvement over um the previous generation of this model that used wi-fi five technology so the wi-fi 6 technology is going to give you faster download and upload speeds it's going to give you it's going to operate better in congested areas and the truth of matter is is just a more efficient chipset so just everything about wi-fi six is is gonna be better it's the latest technology and this pep wave does have that in it this pep wave does also use memo antenna technology memo just means multiple in multiple out and that's using multiple antennas on the on the receive side and then you'll have multiple antennas if you have it on the transmit side then basically those multiple antennas will complete the communication and because there's multiple antennas it can make a much cleaner communication and omit uh errors with that communication because of the multiple antennas and by omitting any errors in that communication it can optimize speed so typically if you have memo technology then you are going to have higher speeds so let's talk about security i know that's important to everybody because you know you're transmitting information out receiving information and so pep wave has always been known for their high levels of security and um and understanding that that's important to the consumer so they do use vpn technology and basically at a high level what they're what they do is whenever you're transmitting data out that data is cut up into very small pieces and then each one of those pieces is then coated with military-grade encryption so each individual like piece is not enough information to even complete a picture of what has been transmitted and then those tiny pieces are then coated with this military-grade encryption so that's kind of a high level on that on on what they're doing there but uh you know i can tell you that you know we've been using the pep ways for a long time and i have no reservations about anything that i do as it relates to the internet whenever i'm going through my pep wave device hey before we move on to the open box portion of this video i want to talk to you just real quickly about uh why you would buy your pep way from techno rv and there's just a few quick reasons i want to review one pricing is always a concern for a consumer and we will always have the lowest price pepwave has a minimum pricing guidelines for all of its certified manufacturers we are a certified pepway dealer and so they say hey here's the lowest you can sell it at and we always sell at that lowest price now if you happen to find somebody that was going below what the manufacturer allows then you can always call us and we will always match that from a certified dealer so price always going to be the lowest at techno rv and then probably the most important thing is our support we have built our entire business on great support we have agents that are highly trained in pep wave and i guess what sets us apart from everybody else is that not only do we have email live chat but i believe that we're the only uh people in the market that actually do good old-fashioned phone support and so that's important because you know you may have questions you may want somebody just kind of walk you through something and if you're the type person that every now and again just wants to pick up the phone and talk to somebody then we're going to give that for you in addition it's free we don't charge you for anything for our support uh we never charge you for that so free support is a big deal when you order from us you're going to get the techno rv learning series which is going to uh is documents and videos that we walk you through how to uh work your unit and get it all set up we're always going to make sure you're successful with your unit that's the bottom line so when you're paying this kind of money for a device you want to make sure that you have that support and that somebody's going to be there for you and techno rv will absolutely be there for you so let's get back into the open box portion of this all right we're in the home stretch here and i went ahead and took everything out of the box here to save us a little bit of time so uh when you order this unit obviously you get the main unit with your dual cat 7 and cat 12 modem and then you will have a set of antennas that will basically screw right onto the unit here and you're going to get two wi-fi antennas and that's going to cover that 2.4 and 5 gigahertz spectrum and then you're going to get four cellular antennas and that's because you'll have two antennas for each modem and so you'll also get a gps receiver that just screws onto this unit this is optional you don't have to use this but if you want to track where this device is then this is the device that will do that as it relates to power uh pep wave has gone to the 4-pin molex connection which is is uh it snaps into place so it's actually a more secure connection than the old barrel style styles that they used to use so you get a ac power supply like a wall outlet with the molex with the kit when you buy from techno rv and this is completely exclusive when you buy from us we're also going to give you at no extra charge a 12 volt cigarette lighter style plug with the molex so if you wanted to run this on your 12 volt system then you could use that to to do that in addition uh you also get some velcro tape here to help you manage your cables and then we also have a couple of brackets here if you wanted to mount this system uh instead of just like laying it in a cabinet or something like that okay so that handles what comes in the box now i want to talk to you about each end of this unit because i want to make sure you understand all what's on here right so on this side of the unit you're going to have your four sma connections for your uh cellular antennas you're going to have your two connections for your uh wi-fi antennas and then right here in the middle is going to be that one for this gps connection as well down bottom here is your sim card slots there's cellular one and cellular two cellular one is your cat 7 modem cellular 2 is your cat 12 modem so if you have t-mobile you're going to want to put your t-mobile card in cellular one because uh that would be the one that can pick up that band 71. uh if you have a verizon card you know that can go in either one and if you have an att card we do recommend you put that in cell number two it'll work in cell one but the cat 12 modem um actually picks up a few a little a few additional things for the uh for the att network so again t-mobile side one verizon side one or two doesn't matter and a t you want to shoot for putting that inside too now there are four sim slots here two for each side so you can load this up with four sim cards uh from you know different carriers and then you can manage those uh different sim cards and data plans from your your console and so that is uh you know kind of makes it a very flexible system uh for you let's go to the other side so this is your power uh connection here that's the four pin molex connection here you do have a lan and a wand connection so again your wan connection is going to be if you have like a dsl or cable hard line most people if you're rving most of the time you're not going to have access to that but if you did like if you had a you know cable from a hardwired modem you could connect it here uh also if you're using like starlink i know some people are starting to try to use that this pep wave will manage all those connections all your cellular connections if you had star link you could plug it into this wind connection here and it would manage all of that for you so that's pretty spectacular you'll have this one lan line and so basically that ethernet port would be this is an out to your machine like your laptop or whatever if you want to hard wire instead of wirelessly connecting to this you can hardline one line into your device now the uh the wan line is is assignable you can if you don't have a wan line you can convert that to a lan line so then you would have two devices that you could hardwire to so that's pretty cool that you can you can assign those it does have a terminal block here if you wanted to do a say a hard wire connection with 12 volt with like two open lead ends then this terminal block would help you do that but honestly uh you know if you're wanting to do 12 volt we're gonna send you that uh molex to cigarette lighter style plug for you to do that with in addition uh down here on the bottom they've added this on this unit it's a usb c n there's two of them here and so this is just more power management if you wanted to run this device from say a battery pack uh then you could do that here with your usb cm so pep waves really thought about like you know the rver and the person that's always on the move and the different kind of power connections that they may have access to at different times and they've kind of got it all covered in this unit right here so that is what you get on uh both sides here as far as your your ports and the antennas i do want to mention one thing as it relates to the uh sim cards uh you know this pep wave device is the unit that kind of makes everything happen but you do need a data plan with with uh sim cards this does take nano size sim cards which is that smallest size and techno rv does have data plans that you can get and we're very proud of this because what we did is we went to the carriers and we negotiated directly with the carrier we didn't do any of this going to a third party this and that things that you read about kind of like nightmares on the on the internet about people that got some data planned and and you know it just didn't quite work out we didn't want to deal with that we go straight to the cares we've got exclusive contracts with them and we're very proud of that so when you buy your pep wave check out our data plans as well now before we move on we talked about the internal antennas and they are great but some people do like to have external antennas with these units and line of sight is very important for you know connecting with cell towers so you will get better performance if you have an outside antenna but it's not necessary a lot of people get them i actually use one myself so if you are going to connect a external antenna to this when you go to techno rv to get your device you'll see that we are recommending the mobility 42g antenna or the pointing seven and one antenna uh for this unit so just having that antenna outside you would run the cables inside and then instead of connecting your internal antennas to this device you would just connect the outside antenna wire connections to this unit here uh the other thing that i want to talk about is that this unit does come with prime care and basically what that is is that gives you one year a one year warranty it gives you one year with their in control ii platform which that's the the management device that you would use to control this from say a laptop or something like that uh customers tend to fall in love with the in control too once they use it because it makes it very easy to make adjustments to this unit right here it also uh the prime care gives you your software updates and it also gives you access to what pep wave calls as speed fusion and speed fusion it includes hot failover wand smoothing and bonding i made another video that explains a lot of these terms and exactly what that means you know speed fusion is going to give you uh a lot of flexibility and for those that are like working on the road and doing like you know zoom calls and they need unbreakable connection speed fusion is the answer to that and you get a year of that with the prime care and then after a year uh you if you can let it expire or you can re-up it for another year so that is it everything you need to know about this unit uh and if i uh if you have more questions we are always here for you it's kind of what we do we want to make sure you're supported when you're going to buy something from technorv so you can email us at info technorv.com you can live chat with us monday through friday or you can give us a phone call monday through friday as well we're always happy to talk to you and i hope this video has been helpful", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2022-08-06T15:37:16Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "Pepwave Max Transit Pro Duo Cat 7 12 Cellular

7/12 Dual-Modem Router\nThe Max Transit Pro DUO has one Cat 7 cellular modem and one Cat 12 cellular modem. This means you can use two SIM cards (cellular plans) at the same time to access the internet, which increases speeds. \nNote: This unit takes Nano SIM cards, which is the smallest SIM size.\n\nDual Sim Card Slots\nBecause the Max Transit DUO Cat 7/12 router has two cellular modems, it allows you to use 2 SIM cards (cellular plans) at the same time (one per modem).\n\nWiFi as WAN Capabilities \nThe Max Transit Duo Cat 7/12 has WiFi as WAN capabilities, which means you can use it to access campground WiFi using 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. \n\nSupports All Major Carrier Networks\nUS Carriers: AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, and US Cellular \nInternational Carriers: Rogers, TELUS, and Bell\n\nSupports Carrier Aggregation \nDual modem routers like the Max Transit DUO support Carrier Aggregation (CA), which means they have the ability to connect to 3 cellular bands (from the same plan) at the same time.  By combining more than one cellular band together, it is possible to increase the bandwidth available.  With the Max Transit DUO Cat 12 Modem you can choose which primary band you want to use (the tower selects the others) which allows you to avoid the crowded primary band used by phones and hotspots. \n\"Cellular 1\" modem is a Cat 7 modem - Cat 7 covers every LTE band available, including T-Mobile Band 71\n\"Cellular 2\" modem is a Cat 12 modem\n\nIncreased Throughput and Speeds\nBecause of Carrier Aggregation, the Max Transit DUO Cat 7/12 has higher throughput and speeds than your traditional cellular router (Jetpack, MiFi, hotspot, etc.). \nThe Max Transit DUO Cat 7/12 has theoretical speeds of 1Gbps down. Of course, real world speeds will be less than that.\n\nThis router features Wifi 6, the latest and greatest wifi technology, promising faster, more efficient wifi performance.\n \nKIT CONTENTS:\nPepwave MAX Transit DUO Cat 7/12 Router\n1 Molex (4-pin) to AC Wall-Style Power Supply\n1 Molex (4-pin) to Cigarette Lighter Style 12V Power Supply\n1 GPS Antenna\n2 WiFi Antenna (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz)\n4 - LTE-A Antennas \n1 Pair of Mounting Brackets\n \nRECOMMENDED EXTERNAL ANTENNA OPTIONS:\nPermanent Omnidirectional 7-in-1 Antenna (4x4 MIMO, 2 WiFi, 1 GPS): Pepwave Mobility 42G 7-in-1 MIMO Antenna\n\nTemporary directional antenna (2x2 MIMO): Poynting A-XPOL Directional MIMO Antenna  (NOTE: The XPOL will only have 2 cellular connection so it would work to improve signal on one of the modems in your dual modem unit)", "channelTitle": "TechnoRV", "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT20M44S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "projection": "rectangular"}, "status": {"uploadStatus": "processed", "privacyStatus": "public", "license": "youtube", "embeddable": true, "publicStatsViewable": true, "madeForKids": false}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "1976", "likeCount": "40", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "3"}}
{"id": "d2P4Wg6d3wo", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "g5_Co4P0bZxO0urZqFUatLSMTH8", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and today i'm going to tell you everything that you need to know about the pepwave max br1 mini cat6 this is the newest generation of cat6 and the improvements of this generation over the older generation cat6 is they have increased the throughput uh dramatically from 100 megs to 300 megs throughput so that is an incredible improvement and also another thing that they did with this is that they also made it to where it is dual wi-fi is when so now that if you get the failover license with this that we'll talk more about here in a little bit you now can access 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz wi-fi as when so that is a great improvement there this is also the lowest price pep wave that we offer so that makes it quite popular because it packs a lot of power and it is at a great price point so in this video we're going to talk about all the features of this and then we're also going to go through what is in the box here and so let's go ahead and get started the first thing that i want you to know is that this unit can handle all of the major carriers so we're talking a t verizon the old sprint stuff t-mobile and it also covers uh canadian carriers like rogers bell and telus and it has all of the updated bands that you would want access to now if you're a t-mobile user the cat 6 modem does not access that that band 71 but you're going to be good on every everything else if you want the band 71 then uh you're going to need to look at either the cat 20 models or the cat 7 models they'll they'll all do it so if that's a concern or you have more questions about that you can contact us about that so let's just go ahead and talk about the speeds that uh this unit can handle so now when i say theoretical speeds this is more like laboratory type speeds obviously real world when you start talking about line of sight what the cell tower can actually provide typically your limiting factor on speeds is going to be your cell plan uh what that particular cell provider can even provide or the cell tower can actually provide for you and it's typically not going to be a pep wave device because they have plenty of downloads speeds and upload speeds so the the max br1 mini is rated at 300 megabits per second down and 50 megabits per per second upload speeds so again if yeah i mean you can do a lot with 300 down and 50 up if you're looking for you know more speeds than that then you just need to go up on the category levels and again we have you know cat 20 uh modems uh 5g type modems and we also have dual band modems that have a cat 7 and a cat 12 modem in them so now we've talked about speed i want to talk about something called carrier aggregation because that's actually something a feature that actually helps you get better speeds carrier aggregation is something that actually just allows you to have access to multiple carrier bands at the same time so imagine a cell tower has say five six seven different bands that you can access but let's say your device can only access one of those bands and let's say that band is completely congested at the time that you were trying to access it so you would have a bad experience when you have aggregation multiple aggregation then that means you can access more than one band at a time and so this unit right here is two times aggregation which means that it can connect to two bands at the same time so even if one band was congested it's going to connect to another uh if that band is is nice and clean then even though somebody that could only connect to that one band would have a bad experience because you had two bands you would have a much better experience because of that aggregation we've already talked a little bit about wi-fi as when and so this unit is dual band wi-fi ap and wi-fi is when let's get the wi-fi ap out of the way first uh the ap is basically your device like your smartphone wirelessly connecting to this device so this device is gonna have cellular service coming in and then you'll need to connect wirelessly to this device so because it's dual band you'll be able to do that with either 2.4 gigahertz or 5 gigahertz so most smartphones these days are doing dual bands so it's nice that this also will do that the wi-fi is when is also dual band 2.4 and five that means this device connecting to say the rv park that may have wi-fi and if they have dual band for you to access this will be able to do that now i want to make it very clear that out of the box these max br1 minis you don't have access to that wi-fi is when unless you buy a failover license once you buy the failover license it's a one-time fee then it opens up that wi-fi is when uh and the wan port on the back which is basically hard lining in a uh internet connection when you buy that failover license it will basically open those up and activate and that's a one-time fee and that's for life so out of the box you don't have wi-fi as wan but when you get the failover license it opens it all up okay and then you'll have dual band from there um so anyway that's a good thing that they offer that dual band and most people that get this unit they do go ahead and get the failover license because it's a one-time thing and you just buy it and get it over with so the max br1 mini does use memo antenna technology for its wireless communication nemo is means multiple in multiple out antennas so basically using multiple antennas for your communication to the say the cell tower so if you have multiple antennas on your end and there's multiple antennas on the transmitter side then basically those antennas at each end of the circuit are combined to minimize errors in that communication to make it a much cleaner communication and by doing that it can increase and improve the performance of that cellular connection and optimize speeds as well so that's a good thing everybody is uh concerned about security because you may be sending sensitive information uh via cellular connection and so you'll be glad to know that pep wave utilizes vpn technology uh with its transmission and basically what it does is whenever you're transmitting information it breaks that transmission down the data into very small pieces i'm just talking from a high level here so it's going to break that transmission down into very small pieces and then each of those small pieces is going to be coated with military-grade encryption so each individual piece you know is not enough to make up the whole picture anyway and then those individual pieces are uh highly encrypted so pepwave has always been known for its security uh because of the measures that they take to ensure that your uh transmissions are secure and safe and so that's basically how they do it and that's uh that's across all the pep wave products but it is also the case in the br1 max mini hey before we move on to the open box portion of this video i want to talk to you just real quickly about why you would buy your pepway from techno rv and there's just a few quick reasons i want to review one pricing is always a concern for a consumer and we will always have the lowest price pepwave has minimum pricing guidelines for all of its certified manufacturers we are a certified pepway uh dealer and so they say hey here's the lowest you can sell it at and we always sell at that lowest price now if you happen to find somebody that was going below what the manufacturer allows uh then you can always call us and we will always match that from a certified dealer so price always going to be the lowest at techno rv and then probably the most important thing is our support we have built our entire business on great support we have agents that are highly trained in pep wave and i guess what sets us apart from everybody else is that not only do we have email live chat but i believe that we're the only people in the market that actually do good old-fashioned phone support and so that's important because you know you may have questions you may want somebody just kind of walk you through something and if you're the type person that every now and again just wants to pick up the phone and talk to somebody then we're going to give that for you in addition it's free we don't charge you for anything for our support uh we never charge you for that so free support is a big deal when you order from us you're going to get the techno rv learning series which is going to uh is documents and videos that we walk you through how to uh work your unit and get it all set up we're always going to make sure you're successful with your unit that's the bottom line so when you're paying this kind of money for a device you want to make sure that you have that support and that somebody's going to be there for you and techno rv will absolutely be there for you so let's get back into the open box portion of this all right to save us a little time i went ahead and unloaded the box because i want to make sure that you know uh what's in here and we're going to talk about all the ports on the max br1 mini as well so when you're going to get your box of course you've got your main unit here and you're also going to get uh two uh cellular antennas uh which i'm sorry are actually here and you're going to get two wi-fi antennas as well because remember we have the 2.4 and the 5 gigahertz wi-fi channels on this in addition uh they upgraded this unit from the older units from a barrel style connection for your power supply to the 4-pin molex connection which actually kind of snaps in there so that is an upgrade and this unit comes with an ac power supply with the molex four pin on the end when you buy from techno rv we also supply you and this is an exclusive thing when you buy from us is we give you another power supply that just comes with this for the same cost a cigarette lighter style 12 volt plug to the molex so if you wanted to run it from 12 volt then you would have the ability to do that in addition it does have the gps receiver here as well and this is basically just sort of tracking where this where this unit is you don't have to connect it if you don't want to but it is there for you if you would like to do that and then they give you some velcro tape to help you sort of uh manage the wires uh in a cabinet or what have you uh so let's go ahead and talk about uh what you get on this unit as it relates to ports uh you do have three lan ports out of the box you're getting three lan ports land is basically a hardwire ethernet connection going from this device to say your laptop okay so instead of you wirelessly connecting to this you can hardwire uh to that so a lot of people just wirelessly connect but if you're doing a lot of business or uh and you just want that little extra assurance then a lot of times hard wire is the way to go but most people don't do that they're typically wireless now one of these ports uh can be converted to a wan port uh and if you'll remember whenever i said that if you're going to get the wi-fi as when so that you can say connect this unit to a rv parks wi-fi then you have to buy that failover license once you buy that then it this wand port right here or i'm sorry this lan port can be converted to a wan port which is basically a hard line coming in now you can use that for uh if you happen to be somewhere where you've got a hardline dsl cable or maybe you're even using like a starlink type thing you can plug that directly into here and then this will be managing your cellular plans uh your your cable dsl starlink whatever it can all be managed from the pep wave so that is very nice there as far as your ports here you're going to have your two wi-fi typical sma type connections here and then you're going to have your two antenna ports for your cellular antennas to screw on the back and then in the middle here you've got your your gps connection here if you wanted to use that now you do have a sim slot here uh this takes a nano sim that's the smallest size and this has the dust cover on it right now but you would basically take that screw out where you could see the two sim ports so it can take two uh sim cards but it's only using one at a time because this is a single modem right but if you had say a at t and a verizon or a t-mobile you could put both of those cards in here and then from the console you can manage how you want to use those designate which one you want to use in certain circumstances and so we really like it because we can just put them in there and kind of forget about that part of it and then manage everything from the console so you do need to supply your own data plan so this is just the hub that gets everything done but you do need a data plan and techno rv does have data plans and you can check them out on our website at technorv.com we're very proud that we have negotiated contracts with the carriers like directly with the carriers this is not any of this third-party business that you you read about that you know people are getting cut off and things like that we went straight to the carriers negotiated exclusive contracts with them and you can when you get your pep wave from us you can just go ahead and pick your data card up as well now this unit does come with one year of prime care and basically uh prime care is going to give you your your one year warranty it's going to give you one year of in control 2 which is the platform to manage this system say from a desktop or a laptop it's going to do all your software updates and then it'll also give you access to speed fusion i've got another video where i talk a little bit more about those different features and what speed fusion is speed fusion on this model really isn't going to do you a whole lot of good unless you get that failover license because part of speed fusion is uh is something called hot failover and if you don't have the wi-fi as when um you know on this from buying that failover license then you don't have anything to fail over to so if your cellular went out hot failover would automatically jump to another service like wi-fi so uh if you don't get the failover license then that really doesn't do you uh any good but anyway there's some other features of speed fusion that again with this unit right here really only do you some good if you go ahead and get that failover license and again most people that buy this unit do go ahead and get the uh the failover license so that's it that's everything that you need to know about the max br1 mini if you need more information or assistance you know we're always here for you techno rv you can call us you can live chat with us or you can email us at info technorv.com we want to help you make the decision on which pep wave is right for you and i hope this has been

A single cellular modem means you can only use one SIM card (cellular plan) at a time to access the internet. \nNote: This unit takes the smallest \"Nano\" SIM card.\n\nAlthough the Max BR1 Mini only has one cellular modem, it allows you to use 2 SIM cards (cellular plans) in the one modem and switch between the two plans as needed.  This allows for the redundancy often needed to stay connected while on the road.  You can also set limits and rules for when you want to use one cell plan over the other which is a great feature when you are trying to conserve one plan and only use it as a backup.  You are not using both cell plans at the same time with this router; however, there are routers available that allow you to use 2 SIM cards at the same time which will improve your connectivity. (See the Max Transit DUO routers.)\n\nWhat is the optional Failover License?\nThe Max BR1 Mini does not come out of the box with WiFi as WAN capabilities, which means you cannot use it to access campground or local WiFi networks. You can add an optional failover software license for $99, which enables Ethernet and unlocks the WiFi as WAN feature. The failover license will allow you to use the BR1 Mini to connect to campground WiFi using a dual band connection (2.4 and 5 GHz).\n\nIf you plan to use your Max BR1 Mini for cellular only, then you do not need to purchase the additional $99 failover license. If you choose to not add it at the time of purchase, don’t worry; you can add it at any time.\n\nSupports All Major Carrier Networks\nUS Carriers: AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, and US Cellular\nInternational Carriers: Rogers, TELUS, and Bell\n\nSupports Carrier Aggregation \nCat 6 routers like the Max BR1 Mini support Carrier Aggregation (CA), which means they have the ability to connect to 2 cellular bands at the same time.  By combining more than one cellular band together, it is possible to increase the bandwidth available.  With the Max BR1 Mini you can choose which primary band you want to use (the tower selects the second) which allows you to avoid the crowded primary band used by phones and hotspots.  \n\nIncreased Throughput and Speeds\nBecause of Carrier Aggregation, the Max BR1 Mini has higher throughput and speeds than a Cat 4 router or phone.  The Max BR1 Mini has theoretical download speeds of 300 Mbps and upload speeds of 50 Mbps. This router features Wifi 6, the latest and greatest wifi technology, promising faster, more efficient wifi performance.\n\nKIT CONTENTS:\nPepwave MAX BR1 Mini Router\n1 Molex (4-pin) to AC Wall-Style Power Supply\n12V Molex 4-Pin to Cigarette-Style Power Supply\n1 GPS Antenna\n2 WiFi Antennas\n2 2dBi LTE Antennas\n\nRECOMMENDED EXTERNAL ANTENNA OTIONS:\nPermanent Omnidirectional 5-in-1 Antenna (4x4 MIMO, 2 WiFi, 1 GPS): Pepwave Mobility 22G 5-in-1 MIMO Antenna\n\nTemporary directional antenna (2x2 MIMO): Poynting A-XPOL Directional MIMO Antenna  (NOTE: The XPOL will only have 2 cellular connection so it would work to improve signal on one of the modems in your dual modem unit)", "channelTitle": "TechnoRV", "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT17M33S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "projection": "rectangular"}, "status": {"uploadStatus": "processed", "privacyStatus": "public", "license": "youtube", "embeddable": true, "publicStatsViewable": true, "madeForKids": false}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "1213", "likeCount": "26", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "1"}}
{"id": "d5b_bT28iQs", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "sRYMTprM4HgqKiJ4BcqYXacbhHI", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and we have a full line of garmin dash cameras for you to choose from we've made individual videos on each one of these and a comparison video of all of them in this video i'm going to tell you everything that you need to know about the garmin dash cam 57. all right this is the dash cam 57 and it is nice and compact pocket size as they call it just like you want for a dash camera and it does have a two inch measured diagonally screen on this unit and it also has a magnetic mount that is one of my favorite features about this this comes with two magnets and basically you just put the magnet onto your windshield and then with your camera you can just easily pop it on and off and then the actual structure of this the what mounts to the magnet is actually on a ball joint so this can rotate in any direction so no matter what angle your window is you're going to be able to get that camera nice and straight on that the uh display resolution on the actual screen here is 320 by 240 pixels now that's on the screen that is not the resolution of the camera and what you're actually shooting from the camera that's uh for the for the screen it is a color lcd screen and this unit weighs just a little bit more than two ounces so again very small very lightweight exactly what you want out of a dash camera it does have a lithium ion battery built into this but these units are designed to be plugged in with constant power while you're using them that battery is only in case you need to unplug it for a little bit to maybe make an adjustment to it or something like that the battery is not designed just to run full time for a trip so make sure that you plug the unit in this unit does come with two power supplies and the only difference in the power supplies is the uh the angle on the connection point so you can you can either use the power supply to where this is going down or you can use the power supply where this is going up depending on what your situation is and what works best for you so it comes with both of those and it comes with the cigarette lighter style adapter so you'll plug this into the cigarette lighter and then plug your power supply into this now this does come with two usb ports so you're not completely eating up your power supply in your vehicle or rv so you'll plug your dash cam into one of these and then you'll have a free usb port to charge a phone or whatever you want to do with that this unit comes pre-installed with a 16 gig sd card and you can put your own sd card in it if you want to up to 500 512 gigs that needs to be a class 10 or faster sd card and so maybe a reason that you would want to put a bigger sd card in it is that these systems do loop over old information typically when you're using a dash camera i mean if you're on a eight-hour drive you're really not wanting to keep eight hours worth of information there might be bits and parts of that trip that you want to keep and you can certainly save those as you go along or at the end of the day but again it is going to loop and record over old information that you don't want to keep in the first place so if you want a little more uh headroom on that you can always just add your own sd card up to 512 gigs so let's talk about some of the additional features with the dash cam garmin 57 here it does have something called incident detection this has in what's called a g sensor and basically what that does is it can detect like a jolt uh something that might be an accident like if you were to get into an accident and this were to jolt then what it would do is it would automatically save that footage from that jolt onto the sd card now again you can go in and manually save whatever you want to on this but in those cases could be a stressful situation maybe you forget or whatever but if it senses that jolt it will go in there and save that on its own so i think that's a very nice feature the camera resolution on the 57 now this is what it's shooting in is uh 1440p and at a 60 frames per second record rate and so that is very high resolution you're going to get a very nice crisp clean uh video out of this and 60 frames per second is a very high rate and basically what that's going to do is that's going to minimize uh any motion blur that you might have so the less frames per second that you the camera might have you're obviously videoing a lot of things that are moving um and and so the less frames per second you have you can maybe start getting a little bit of blur on something that goes by you or a sign that goes past you so 60 frames per second is excellent and then again that 1440 uh pixels is an incredible um is going to be incredible clarity for you when you go back and re-watch the footage off of this this unit has a viewing angle of 140 degrees so that is quite generous and uh no matter the size of windshield you have whether you're in a truck or a big class a uh 140 is very generous and is really gonna going to get you a nice big picture out of the front of that windshield the dash cam 57 does have voice control so from my driver's seat i can say hey garmin take a picture maybe i come around a corner and there's a nice mountain pass and i want to get a picture of that from this i can say hey garmin take a picture and boom it'll it'll snap a picture hey garmin save this this video footage it'll do that uh it does have microphone um controls on this and you can turn that on and off with voice controls as well if you want a voice on your videos of y'alls your conversations in your rv or truck then you can certainly have that but you can also certainly take that off as well this unit does uh tag your gps location and your your speed at which you're traveling at any given moment that will be embedded on the screen or you can go into the settings and say i don't want that embedded in this on the screen that is totally up to you the garmin dash cam there's the family of garmin dash cameras uh can they can auto sync with up to four different dash cameras so what that means is if you were wanting to use this for uh maybe security reasons or maybe you have one out the front maybe you have one out of your back windshield maybe you're at an rv park and you want one out the side window you can certainly sync all those up and what that means is that whenever you go back and view these it'll line up the date and the time stamp on that to where your you can watch them simultaneously from all of the different camera angles the garmin dash cams work with the garmin drive app and you can just download that onto your smartphone and then bluetooth to this unit and then you can basically control the dash camera from that drive app so a lot of times when we're going down the road tammy will pull up the drive app and she can actually see on her smartphone what the camera is seeing to make sure she's got a good viewing angle and then if she wants to snap a picture along the way she can do that from her app she wants to save a particular video she can do that adjust a setting or something she can do all that from that uh that drive app so it is a very very handy app and it works very well with the garmin drive app you can from your phone go back and review footage now you can do it from the screen here as well but you can do that from your smartphone so maybe that'll give you a bit of a bigger screen to maybe go back and look at footage and see what footage you might want to save or not save so it kind of makes that nice to be able to do that from your from your smartphone with the drive app the garmin 57 has something called parking guard it's really a security feature so if let's say that you're not with your vehicle if you've got your camera set up and you're giving it you've given it consistent power uh if some if it were to detect a bump or some kind of movement or something like that then it can notify you of that uh and give you a a video clip of whatever happens to be going on so that might be a nice feature for those that are maybe you know have parked your rv somewhere for a period of time and you kind of want that extra security the garmin dash cam will do that for you with the garmin drive app you can also do live view and you do have to have wi-fi for that you need to be connected to wi-fi because you can from your smartphone with your drive app from another location actually see what this is seeing so that's a nice feature again just from a maybe a security standpoint or uh you know you just want to see the outside of your rv or the inside of your rv or or whatever the case may be you can absolutely do that but again this would need consistent power to it and you would need wi-fi as well to make that happen the garmin 57 has some driver assist features that are pretty nice so if you're driving down the road and you start floating out of your lane a little bit it'll give you a nice little audible nudge to let you know that you're getting out of your lane a bit uh if you are traveling uh too close to somebody or if you're coming up on somebody uh a bit too fast then again it'll give you that audible nudge to let you know that and then also let's say you're sitting at a stoplight and there's a car in front of you and the light turns green and the car takes off and and maybe you're you're looking at something you just don't recognize that it'll notice that car taken off and you haven't moved and it'll uh again give you a nice little audible nudge to uh to ask you to get moving so again those are driver assist features that just make life a little bit easier on the road another kind of fun feature that the 57 has it has a travel lapse feature so you can take a long piece of travel footage and it'll condense that down into a much shorter video for you to watch or share with your friends and and family so that is the the features of the the garmin 57 and again when you get this you get the camera two charging uh cables your 12 volt uh cigarette lighter style power supply your quick start guide and a couple of magnets to mount it with you can get all this over at technorv.com and again we do have several other models and we have made a video to where we compare all these different models if you're needing a little bit more information on which model is right for you and as always we are here for you so if you want to call chat or email with us hop on over to

47 so here it is the dash cam 47 and it is indeed pocket sized very small for your windshield and that's the way you want it it does have a two inch uh measured diagonally screen on the back of it and it mounts with actually one of my favorite features the mount it is on a ball rotation and it's basically just a magnet you get two of these magnets and basically the magnet will just go on your

resolution here that's not the camera resolution we'll talk about that here in just a minute and this is a color led screen that you have here it's very lightweight just weighs just a little bit over two ounces so really nothing to speak of there the it does have a lithium battery in this unit and that battery will last about 30 minutes off the cable but this is designed to be run on consistent power so the only reason that you would really need the battery in this is if you just pulled it off the power just for a little bit just to make an adjustment or something if you needed to do that but while you're going down the road it needs to have consistent power and you do get two power uh cables for this and the difference in these cables is one of them is uh in case you want to mount it in the down position and then the other one is so that you can mount it in the up position whichever you prefer you've got those options and then of course it's got the cigarette lighter style plug here with two usb ports in it so obviously you'll only need one of these usb ports for your power supply so that opens you up another one in case you want to charge a phone or something like that the unit comes pre-installed with a 16 gig sd card uh you can put up to a 512 gig sd card uh a class 10 or faster so it definitely has some headroom for you to add more space to this unit if you want to one reason that you might choose to put a larger sd card in this is that this does continuously loop so as it records it will loop over old information and so with a larger card it'll just hold a lot more information most people whenever they're using dash cameras they're not wanting to keep like eight hours worth of travel but there might definitely be some footage within that eight hour time period that you want to keep and you can certainly save those clips but for the most part it is a great feature that this actually goes through and just loops over old information that you have chose not to keep in the first place so let's get into some of the cameras features and this has something called incident detection so this has what they call a g sensor in it and if this if the g sensor uh detects a jolt uh something mimicking like an accident then it will automatically save that footage so if you were to have an accident you know you can always go in and save footage but this feature actually when it feels that jolt it'll actually go in and save that information for you automatically and the this camera does have uh gps coordinates uh time stamped and uh the the speed at which you're traveling and you can have that on the screen or you can choose to not have that on the screen the camera resolution what the camera is actually shooting in is 1080p and so it is high definition and it does have a 140 degree viewing angle so a lot of good field of vision there to really capture everything out of your out of your front windshield the frame rate at which it records is 30 frames per second and so that's good for a unit like this the higher the frames per second uh basically just means that anytime you're recording something in motion uh you can have some motion blur so the higher you can get on the frames per second the better and 30 is is a pretty good spot to be at the dash cam 47 does have voice controls so this really makes it easy like i can just say okay garmin uh record or save this video hey garmin uh take a picture because a lot of times when we're traveling and this is up there maybe we come around a corner and there's a great looking mountain or something that i want a picture of then i can just voice control and say hey garment to snap a picture and it'll just go ahead and snap a picture of uh of what's in front of it so that's a very nice feature you can also voice control like turning on and off the um the uh the microphone controls on here so it can record like the vocals within the car if you want that that's great if you don't then you can just turn that off the dash the garmin dash cameras do have a feature where you can sync up to four different cameras so if you wanted a camera in the front and maybe out the back or for security reasons you want one on a side window if you're an rv in an rv park or something it can basically sync all those together to where whenever you go back and watch footage it'll line up the the date and time and it can run those simultaneously the the garmin dash cameras work with an app called garmin drive and this is a really convenient feature because you can download load this on your smartphone and you can basically operate the functions of the gps from your smartphone so a lot of times when we're driving down the road tammy can actually have her smartphone out and she can actually on her phone see what the camera is seeing and so uh and if she wants to like snap a picture she can just do all that from her phone if she wants to save a recording she can do that from her phone so it's kind of nice for a passenger in real time to be able to make adjustments with the the dash cam through that garmin drive app also with the garmin drive app there is a feature called parking guard and basically what this means is that while you're parked uh if there was uh movement or if the sensor felt something bump the the the vehicle then this would actually record that and then it can actually send you the information in a video clip so that you can see what's going on it's also got a remote live view now you do need wi-fi for that from the camera and but basically what that means is from anywhere you can actually see what the camera is seeing so if you had your rv um you know parked somewhere and you weren't with the rv then you could have that now of course the camera is going to need consistent power to be able to do that and again it does need to be connected to wi-fi in order to use that feature as well but that all works through that garmin drive app the dash cam 47 also has some driver assist features you can turn these on you can turn them off if you want to but basically it has a lane assist if you start to drift out of your lane it will uh give you a little audible sound to uh let you know that you're starting to drift out of your lane uh it's also got if you're uh coming up on or following someone too closely it'll give you a little audible alarm for that as well and then also if you're let's say at a stop light and the person in front of you takes off and then you don't take off it'll give you a nice little nudge to tell you it's time to go so just a couple of driver assist features that i think are pretty nice and they're all included with the dash cam 47 another kind of fun feature of the garmin dash camera is it has something called the travel lapse feature and it basically can condense a long drive into a much shorter video that you can go back and watch or share with your friends and family so just a quick review of what you get with the dash cam 47 the camera you get your cigarette lighter style plug you get two different power supplies you get two magnets uh to mount with and then you get your quick start guide as well this is the dash cam 47 we do have other models that you can look at over at techno rv and we've got videos on those as well and then we do have that comparison video of all of them to help you

that you need to know about the garmin dash cam 67w all right this is the garmin 67w and it is indeed small in stature pocket size as they call it and that is exactly what you want for a dash camera something that doesn't take up a whole lot of windshield space it does have a two inch measure diagonally screen on this unit and it mounts with this clever magnetic mount here and this is basically you get two magnets and you basically just mount a magnet onto the windshield where you want to mount your garmin dash cam and then you can just easily pop it on and off so i really love how they've mounted this the mount on the camera actually comes on a ball joint so you can see it just rotates very easily and what this allows you to do is no matter what your windshield angle is you're always going to be able to get a nice straight shot out of the front this display resolution and when i say display i mean the the two inch display that is a color lcd display is 320 by 240 pixels now again that's your display resolution that is not your what you're going to be your pixels for what you're going to be shooting it's not that resolution so this unit weighs in at just a little over a couple of ounces so again very small very lightweight exactly what you want for a dash camera this unit does have a lithium ion battery in it that this unit is designed to be run on constant power while you're going down the road uh the lithium-ion battery will be good for about 30 minutes if you take it off of power and really that's just there if you took it off of power and you want to make some adjustments to it or something that you would have the ability to do that but whenever you buy this kit you do get two power cords here and uh they're they're basically almost identical except for the part that plugs into the camera is reversed on one of the cables so if you want to mount it with this facing down you've got a cable for that if you want to mount it with this facing up then you've got a cable for that and then of course these cables will plug into this cigarette lighter style plug that you'll plug in to give it power and this comes with two usb ports on it and so obviously your dash cam will take up one of those but they were thoughtful enough to give you another usb port here in case you want to charge up a smartphone or something like that this unit comes pre-installed with a 16 gig sd card uh you can upgrade that yourself if you want to up to a 512 gig sd card it needs to be a class 10 or faster sd card so as long as you check the boxes there you'll be good to go one reason you you somebody might choose to have a bigger sd card is that this unit does loop over old information typically whenever you're using a dash camera and you're maybe driving down the road for eight hours you really don't want to keep that full eight hours you can certainly go in and manually save certain parts that you do want to keep but the parts you don't want to keep this system's just going to go and just loop over that and record back over it so if you want a little bit more headroom on that amount of data then you can always add a bigger sd card uh to this system so let's talk about the resolution that the 67w had this is what the resolution that you're shooting video with it's 14 high definition and that is very good and it shoots at 60 frames per second which is also excellent so the more frames per second that you can shoot in that's going to minimize what they call motion blur so with a dash cam obviously you're in motion and there's things around you in motion and so uh if you don't have enough frames per second then you can get like so what they call motion blur like maybe on a sign or a license plate or something like that so recording in 1440p and having that 60 frames per second is really going to give you a nice clear crisp vivid video and obviously that's what you want out of a a dash camera uh this unit here does shoot uh it's it's uh viewing angles 180 degrees so this is the biggest viewing angle of any of the garmin dash cameras so uh it's 180 degrees which is basically a straight line so i mean you can imagine it's giving you a massive viewing angle so um so that's kind of nice to to know that you've got the biggest viewing angle and again that's that's where that w on the 67 comes because it's wide at wide angle this unit does time or stamp your gps location and your uh your time your miles per hour that you're going that will be stamped on the video if you want it if you don't want it then you can just turn that setting off and it it won't be on there so uh having it on there could you know help in the case of maybe an insurance claim or something like that but it's totally up to you if you want to leave that on there or not the family of garmin dash cameras uh can sync together which means that you can uh it'll sync up to four garmin dash cameras and what this means is maybe you've got a dash camera up front maybe you want one out the back window maybe when you're in an rv park you want one out the side window or something or just for a security purpose it's got this feature to where it can basically sync all those together to where you can watch them in frames and it'll go back and take the the date and time stamp and it can run those simultaneously together which is a very nice feature of this this camera reviewing footage is so easy there's an app called the garmin drive app and basically once you download that on your smartphone and bluetooth to this unit you can basically see everything that you saved you can see in real time what this is seeing so a lot of times when we're driving down the road tammy will have her smartphone out and she can literally watch what the camera's seeing a she wants to make sure the camera angle's right if she needs to adjust that and then b uh a lot of times she'll just snap a picture from her phone because while you're driving down the road if you're like oh well that's beautiful she can just on her phone just hit boom take a picture it'll snap that picture she can save video she can change settings just all kinds of features with that garmin drive app so it's highly recommended that you get that on your smartphone and link this up to this to make it just a bit easier you can do everything from the dash camera but again the garmin drive app does make it a little easier this camera has a feature called parking guard it's really a security feature to where if you're not with your vehicle then uh and and this senses some kind of movement then it will capture that movement and it can notify you of that with footage from whatever was going on around that vehicle so it's kind of a safety feature if you want to use this if you're doing that you definitely need constant power to your unit in order to be able to do that you do need that garmin drive app as well it also has a live view and again with that you need constant power you do need wi-fi and then you would need the garmin drive app on your smartphone so you don't even have to be around this and if you have it set up properly i can from wherever i'm at i can see what this is uh what this is viewing so if you leave your rv uh stored or just somewhere for a couple of days you can always check in and kind of see what's going on with that live feature again constant power wi-fi you got to have it to make that work the 67 has some driver assist features that i really like and basically uh it has a lane keeping assistant and so if you start to drift out of your lane it'll just give you a gentle audible nudge to let you know you started to drift out of your lane also if you're driving too closely to someone or you're coming up on somebody too fast again it'll give you that audible alert for that and then let's say you're sitting at a a stop light and there's a car in front of you and the light turns green and that car takes off and you just don't happen to see it because maybe you're looking down or something this will notice that that car left and you didn't move and it'll give you that gentle nudge to uh tell you to get moving and so anyway it's just a few things like that that this garmin dash camera has that makes driving just a little bit easier another feature of the garmin is that it has something called travel laps this is kind of fun it if let's say you took a you know four or five hour trip you can actually condense footage down into a much shorter video for you to watch of that footage and you can watch that or share it with friends so that's just kind of a fun feature that uh that it has and that's called travel lapse so when you get the dash cam 67 you're getting your your dash camera you're getting your two power cables your cigarette lighter style plug with the additional usb port built in you're getting a quick start guide and then you're getting two magnet mounts to mount the the camera with and so again we've got a lot of different models of the garmin dash cams over at technorv.com and we've also made a comparison video of all the different models if you need that to help you make your decision and then as always we are here to help so if you uh have more questions and you want to call chat or email with us then you can just hop on over to technorv.com", "snippet": {"publishedAt":

{"id": "rrjhrpcFywY", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "MhHA50O20yX-TYg7HiuBLaQzoLM", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and we've got a full line of garmin dash cameras i've made a video on each one of these models and i have a comparison video where i just kind of walk you through the differences on all these but in this video i'm going to tell you everything that you need to know about the garmin dash cam mini 2. so this is the garmin dash cam mini 2 it is the smallest of the lineup and the most economical of the lineup as well and so i do want to point out on the dash cam mini this does not come with a screen on the back of it you will be able to access the footage through an app that we'll talk about here in a little bit it does have a great mounting option here this is on a ball joint so that no matter what angle your windshield is you'll always be able to get a nice straight shot you get two of these mounting options and basically it connects on the ball joint so basically you're just going to connect this to your windshield with the uh with the the sticky pad and then you would just simply then just pop the camera onto the ball joint the dash cam mini 2 is just weighs just a little bit over an ounce so as it relates to dash cameras you definitely want them to be small and you definitely don't want them to weigh a lot you don't want this to take up a lot of windshield space and the the mini 2 actually hits a home run with that this unit does not have a built-in battery to it it is designed to be run with power supply connected to it at all times this unit does come with two power supplies these are usb cables and the only difference in these is the connection point can either be mounted in the down position or if you've got a scenario where you want to mount it in the up position then you've got another cable that will work with that as well and then you will connect that with the included cigarette lighter style plug and this does include two usb ports so quite thoughtful of garmin there because one of these ports is going to be taken up by the dash cam and then you have another usb port if you want to charge a smartphone up or something like that you will need to put a sd card into this unit and that is not included with this unit it's a minimum of an 8 gig sd card that you'll need to put into this but it will take up to a 512 gig sd card and that needs to be a class 10 or faster sd card a reason that you might choose to maybe put a bigger sd card in it than something on the lower end of that spectrum is that this unit is going to loop and record over old information which is actually a nice feature typically whenever you're traveling with a dash camera maybe you're on an eight-hour trip most people don't want that whole eight hours but there may be certain clips out of that time frame that you will want to go in and save but the information that you don't want it will loop back around and record over that so by having a bigger sd card it just gives you a little bit more headroom on how much information saved before it starts that loop again the mini has a feature called the incident detection feature this has what's called a g sensor in it and it can detect uh a harsh movement something that might mimic like an accident so if you were in an accident and this shook uh it would activate that and it would go ahead and lock down that data the footage that it just took now again you can manually go in and and save whatever footage you want but in a in a stressful situation like that it's kind of nice to know that that g sensor will identify that and actually lock that footage down for you the camera resolution on the mini is 1080p so it is high definition and it records at 30 frames per second so very respectable numbers there and it's got a 140 degree viewing angle so nice generous viewing angle and again you will be recording in hd as well the lineup of garmin cameras whether it's this one or the other cameras they can sync up up to four different garmin cameras and so if you wanted one out the front maybe one out the back or maybe just from a security standpoint an rv you want one out the side window while you're somewhere uh it can basically link all those together to where whenever you go back and look at that footage that it they're they're basically in sync and on the right time with each other the mini works with the garmin drive app and so this is going to be a great feature uh with this unit because when you download that drive app onto your phone you can now from that drive app see the footage out of this again this does not have a screen on it but when you have the drive app and bluetooth to this that your phone actually becomes your your screen so uh also with that drive app you can you know change settings and different things like that a lot of times when we're driving down the road tammy will have her drive app out and she can see the footage that this is recording and then in real time she can like uh maybe we come around the corner and there's a nice mountain pass she wants to make sure we get a picture of that she can on that drive app just hit take a picture or maybe there's a piece of footage that she wants to make sure we save she can go in and do that and from the drive app you can go in and look at all the video clips and so that is really going to be your resource to see what this is doing and uh and saving also another nice feature of this is that with that garmin drive app it does have remote live view now this would need to be connected to power and you would need wi-fi available to that but basically if you're not around your rv or your truck or whatever but you want to see what this is seeing at that time then you could pull the garmin drive app up and you could you could actually see what this is is viewing so that's kind of nice if you leave your rv uh even if it's in storage or you're just leaving it for a few days to be able to go and just kind of peek in on things so when you get the mini you're going to get of course your mini your two power supplies your cigarette lighter style plug with that extra usb port and then you're going to get two of the stick on mounts and then you're going to of course get your your quick start guide uh the the mini is definitely checks a lot of boxes as far as a it's it is the most economical of the garmin cameras and as it relates to just its stature it is the smallest of them all as well we have a lot of different models of the garmin that we've made individual videos on and we've also made a video comparing them all so if you want to check that out to help you make your decision you're welcome to do that and as always we are here for you to

{"id": "VktIx8TBuO8", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "p7isQZqB6u74dEuzJtW_jOvsy_U", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and we offer a full line of garmin dash cameras for you to choose from and what we have in front of us is the dash cam mini 2 the dash cam 47 57 and the 67 w and i really just want to get into the features and the differences in all of these units to help you make a decision on which one of these units is right for you now there are more similarities in the 47 57 and 67 w than there are with the mini version over here so i want to kind of start with that all of these units here have a two a two inch uh screen measured diagonally across okay whereas the mini does not have a a screen so that is one difference the 47 57 and 67 w all weigh just a little over two ounces whereas the mini weighs just a little over an ounce so this is really a small unit but again it doesn't have the display on the back of it the mounting for these units is the same on the 47 57 and 67 in that they use a magnet uh with a sticky pad on it you basically just stick that to your windshield and then these units will just pop on and off of that magnet so that's a really great feature there and each one of these units comes with two of these magnets so you can have two different mounting locations the dash cam mini it does not use a magnet but it does uh use the ball joint uh connection with the sticky pad so instead of sticking a magnet on your windshield you're basically sticking that on your windshield right and then that just connects to the mini let's talk about the the screens on the 47 57 and 67 these are lcd color screens and the resolution on this screen is 320 by 240 pixels now that's the resolution of this screen that is not the resolution of the the camera uh resolution that you'll be shooting the video with okay that's only the screen the uh 47 57 and 67 all have lithium ion batteries but they are designed to be run on a power cable but that battery will allow you to maybe if you're just going to take it off power for a little bit it will last about 30 minutes on that battery if you just want to make a few adjustments on the dash cam if that was needed it does give you that ability to do that whereas the mini does not have a battery built into it it's going to need to be on the cable at all times but again i want to make it clear all of these while you're using them going down the road on a trip do need to be powered and all of these units come with two power supplies uh they're the usb type and the only difference in the power supplies is the connection point has it to where you can connect it to the dash cam with this facing down the cable going down or the other one has it to where the cable is going up so whatever works for you based on how you're connecting it you'll have that now these are going to connect into the included cigarette lighter style plug that has two usb ports on it so one of these usb ports will be taken up by the dash camera and then the other one is there for you to use as you please if you want to connect a smartphone up to it to charge it or something it just gives you an extra port but again all four of these units are coming with these cables and this power connection here and again the difference is is these units do have the lithium-ion batteries just for short-term use whereas the mini does not have that the 47-57 and 67 come with an included 16 gig sd card the mini does not come with an included sd card you need to supply that yourself and the mini needs to at least be an 8 gig and up to 512 gigs and that sd card needs to be a class 10 or faster sd card now on these units here that come with a 16 gig card you can put your own card in there again up to 512 gigs class 10 or faster sd card the reason that you might want to consider using a larger sd card is that all of these units have a looping feature on them and what that means is that it's going to go over and loop over old information typically if you're on an eight hour drive you're not wanting to keep that entire eight hours there may be certain clips that you want to keep and you can go in and save those uh but this the information or the video that you don't want to keep it's going to kind of make that easy for you so it'll go back over and just loop back over that to where you're it's it's not like you're just running out of an sd card and then it just stops recording it will always be recording so that is a uh a great feature that these these have some of the main differences on these cameras comes in the resolution in which it is shooting the video the frames per second at which it is shooting and the viewing angle so i just want to kind of go through all these and let's just get that out of the way so you have that information the dash cam mini is shooting in 1080p that's high definition at 30 frames per second with a 140 degree viewing angle the dash cam 47 is also at 1080p hd it is also 140 degree viewing angle and again at 30 frames per second the 57 is shooting at 1440p high definition and it is shooting at 60 frames per second and has a 140 degree viewing angle and then the 67w is shooting in 1440p hd and it is at 60 frames per second and it gives you a 180 degree viewing angle now what does all that mean let's start let's talk about uh the viewing angle so uh these three are 140 and this is 180 so obviously 180 is just a straight line across right so it is the largest viewing angle but 140 is very generous and i have used a 140 viewing angle for the past year year and a half and again it is it is very generous as it relates to the frames per second that it's shooting these two at 30 frames per second these two are at 60 frames per second what that can do is when you're using a dash camera obviously you're in motion and there's things around you in motion and so when things are moving by at a fast rate the higher frames per second that you shoot at can minimize certain uh motion blurring okay now 30 frames per second is still respectable 60 frames per second is just better okay so it might be where uh you're passing something and there might be like a a sign or or something like that and there might be just a bit of of of uh there could be a bit of blurring to where maybe the the 60 frames per second it's not now i've used the 30 frames per second plenty and uh i don't see a lot of that blurring but i'm just giving you the technical aspects of that's kind of what that's doing whenever you're shooting it at a higher frame as it relates to the resolution again these two are 1080p uh and then these two are 1440 the higher the resolution the the crisper uh the the uh the the picture is gonna be the video is gonna be um even even the the colors will be uh a bit more brilliant but again 1080 is great is just just better and of course as you as you move up the line here i mean you're getting what you pay for here right so you know obviously the the least expensive model is the mini and then the 47 57 and 67 but also as we moved up the line here you did get high again higher resolution um faster frames per second bigger viewing angle and uh and that's a lot of what you're paying for as these models get just a bit more expensive now let's get into some of just the features of these and some of the differences and what you'll find is that these features that i'm about to talk to talk about these three models here the 47 57 and 67 w will be the same and then the mini will be a little bit different so uh the 47 57 and 67 uh will track and imprint the uh gps speed and location um onto the screen whereas the mini does not have the ability to do that out of the box so um you don't have to have that on there you can turn that feature off to where it's not on the video uh some people like to leave it on there in case there's a insurance claim or something it might be helpful but you you do have that ability um on these three units and and out of the box you just don't have that ability on the mini all of these cameras these dash cameras here um can work together in in something called uh their their video sync so you can you can sync up to four cameras together and basically what this means is that say you had a camera up front maybe you have a camera out back maybe you want one out the side or something like that that it can sync all these together to where you can watch them in blocks and they'll be running on the same time frame so it's just kind of a nice feature that these cameras have let's talk about viewing footage now we know the 47 57 and 67w have that screen on the back of them but all of these units work with the garmin drive app and from that garmin drive app you can actually see what's what the camera is seeing uh and so a lot of times it's it's crucial on the the mini and just very very convenient on these other ones even though these have a two inch screen on them but a lot of times uh when me and tammy are going down the road she'll have that drive app up bluetooth to our dash camera and she can see what it's seeing so it's just a much bigger screen and she can also like snap a picture maybe we see a nice mountain range or something that we want to save that picture she can just click take a picture and it'll take the picture in addition she can save videos from that app she can uh go in and view videos that have been saved as well and she can also adjust settings on these cameras from that app so it just gives you sort of a platform that's something that you're more used to dealing with as opposed to something much smaller in these dash cameras the 47 57 and 67 have a feature called park guard and what this basically means is that if you keep these on on constant power and you're away from the vehicle and it detects some kind of movement or motion that it can notify you of that and and send you a clip of that and the mini does not have the ability to do that with that garmin drive app all of these units have remote a remote live feature and basically what this means is that if you're not at that vehicle with the camera in it you can still see what the camera is viewing away from that but it does require constant power and it does require wi-fi so if you don't have those then that feature is not going to work but if you uh can check all the boxes there and you've got the garmin drive app then it's kind of a nice feature especially if you leave your rv or truck somewhere and you just want to check in on it the 47 57 and 67 have driver assist features whereas the mini does not the driver assist features are kind of nice they have lane keeping assistance to where if you start to drift out of your lane it'll give you a nice little audible alarm to let you know you need to stay in your lane it's also got if you're following somebody too close or coming up on somebody uh too fast it'll give you that audible alarm as well and then it's also got something that if say you're at a red light and there's a car in front of you and it turns green and they take off and then maybe you're looking down and you didn't see them take off the camera will know will notice that they took off and you didn't take off yourself and it'll give you that gentle audible nudge uh to get you back going again so that's all the similarities and differences between these four models we did make individual videos about each one of these cameras so if you are intrigued by a particular one i would encourage you to go watch that one where we really just focus on that one dash camera you can get all of these units over at technorv.com we're always here to support you and if you have any questions that you need to ask to help you with the

garmin epics watch generation 2 epics and i wanted to talk to you about some of its features and we have many of the garmin watches that you can check out over at technorv.com and so let's just hop right into it this epics watch is the top of the line garmin watch so garmin has a lot of different watches and and typically those watches may focus on something in particular that you like doing maybe like golfing or hiking or skiing or something like that the epics kind of rolls everything all up into one watch so it's it's for those that uh maybe are into a lot of different things and you don't want to just have to choose one you just want the best of the best the epics is definitely it it comes in white or black uh and it's titanium uh one of the things that i love about the garmin watches and the reason that i originally started wearing garmin watches is because their battery life is is uh pretty insane i can go 16 days in smart watch mode on the epics before i have to charge it and back in the day whenever i wore like an apple watch tam you used to wear wear these android watches we were charging them almost every day so i'm highly impressed by the garmin's battery life in this model and many of their other models the display is a amo led display that is a active matrix organic light emitting diode and to make that simple uh that it just means that you get what you're paying for here so that is a top of the line screen it is going to be great in sunlight looking at it from different angles you're always going to have a good view with that type of screen it's very durable it's flexible and one of my favorite things about this is that you can customize the face of the watch now you have all different kinds of screens that you can choose from on the epics but again you can customize the face and so uh in one case i put like a mountain scene of a picture we had taken a picture of and then of course my favorite is a picture of our late bulldog lincoln that i put on the face screen okay let's get into all of the features and everything that this watch does let's just talk about uh 24 7 health tracking so of course you've got your heart rate uh monitor built into this watch and it can also alert you if your heart rate gets too high or if you want to be alerted at a certain level that's nice respiration tracking stress tracking and i always thought like uh is this legit but then like if i'm feeling stressed and i look at my stress tracker it's eerily correct and uh also the sl it's got this thing called sleep score and body battery and basically it's tracking like how much energy you've exerted how much sleep you've had lately and it takes all of these sort of data points and tells you like where you're at as it relates to hey you should probably be resting right now or yeah you're probably ready for another workout so really anything as it relates to to health anything that you could possibly track on a watch it can track it on the epics so no matter what activity you're into whether there's an app for the epics as it relates to that activity whether it's running swimming biking hiking rowing skiing golfing i mean it's just like anything you want to get into it's going to have an app to help you track those activities also it's got workout recommendations recommendations and suggestions for you if you want that and it wouldn't be a garmin watch unless it had some good navigation features which is something that garmin is just completely known for so it's got completely accurate satellite positioning built into this watch it's got an altimeter so that it can deal with elevation a barometer for monitoring weather it's got a three axis electronic compass built into it it's got all of your top topography mappings in it it's got ski maps like golf courses like garmin makes a watch specifically for golfing the epics watch basically just brings all of these different apps including that into this watch so for example as it relates to golfing no matter what golf course you're in it can track where you're at on the golf course it can tell you how far you are from the pin it'll show you the hole um it'll give you recommendations on what clubs to use and it's tracking your score how many swings you've taken i mean it's got it all covered so whenever i say things like these sports apps i don't mean that it's just like from some surface level kind of tracking these things i mean it is completely built in like like that golf app so i really love that about the garden and finally a smart watch like the garmin wouldn't be great unless it helps you stay connected so this can sync flawlessly with your apple and android smartphones so any smart notifications you're going to be able to get those on your watch any music apps that you want to use like we sync all of our music to the watch we happen to use spotify but whatever uh program that you happen to use for that you're going to be able to sync that it's also got the garmin pay option on it so that you can do wireless pay through your watch so again as it relates to just staying connected the garmin epics has you covered there as well so there you have it it's the garmin epics watch it is the top of the line watch from garmin and you can get it over at technorv.com", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2022-06-11T22:00:14Z", "channelId":

dual zone cooler it is a 75 liter unit which converted into cans 12 ounce cans means you can fit 113 cans in here uh the beauty about the uh this this cooler is that it is dual zone uh and that means that it has two separate compartments in it and you can set these up any way you please i can have two refrigerators two freezers or i can have a refrigerator and a freezer and so this will go from refrigerator temperatures all the way down to negative seven degrees fahrenheit and so uh when we're traveling in our boondocking setup this is the unit that we just keep in our trailer with most of our refrigerated and freezer goods in it when we're in our class a motorhome we like to put this in one of our uh bays and so for us if you like over here is just refrigerated items i mean we've got again i know they convert things into like how many cans you can put in here but we have you know mayonnaise ketchup pickles lettuce barbecue sauce leftovers just all kinds of things in here and then in the freezer section we can literally carry ice cream right so because again negative seven uh degrees we've got a couple of things of ice cream in here fresh golf shrimp we've got sausage that you can only get from our home state of alabama in here so we go travel and we like to pick up some extra packs of that so anyway this is this cooler runs off of ac and dc power so if you're running this off of ac power it's only drawing 0.94 of an amp at 120 volts if you're running at uh 12 volts dc then you're it's going to pull about 9.6 amps so extremely efficient and uh what i've seen is when this thing gets up to temperature then you know basically the the compressor just kind of shuts off and it's really not hardly drawing anything at that point when it needs to kick on it'll kick back on so it's very efficient in how it does that it comes with a six and a half foot ac cord here it also comes with a user manual and then of course you're going to get your cooler here and then it also comes with a six and a half foot uh dc power supply and a lot of times when i'm off grid i will just power this with the dometic plb-40 unit so this is uh dc power being supplied to the the cooler here and so i can just plug into this unit and plug directly into my dometic cooler so this is a kind of a perfect pairing for any of the dometic coolers to pair it with a dometic battery pack and these are easily charged back up through either ac or dc power and then it's also got usb ports and everything like that so this is not included with the cooler however but you can get these also over at technorv.com this unit weighs in at 61 pounds it is 35.12 inches i guess we would call long here it is 18.58 i guess we would call that depth and then from a height standpoint it's 19.49 it does come with heavy-duty handles on each side so that you can pick the unit up also these handles can be removed if you have like a tight space that you're fitting it in and your and you really don't need the handles you can always remove the handles it does come with a color display over here and this color display is where you're going to set your temperatures in both of your zones so for us i've got our our freezer set to about 14 degrees and our our refrigerator set to about 35 36 degrees so you can set that however you want it but this is where you do that over here it also has an app a cfx app to where i can make any adjustment that i want to this cooler on an app right so i can adjust temperatures i can go in there's a this also comes with a three-stage battery protection program to where depending on how you're powering this for example if you're powering this say off of a vehicle battery and the vehicle is not running then obviously you don't want to drain the battery down to where you can't start the vehicle so there's some settings in there to where you can go to where it'll protect those those type battery situations so that's kind of a cool feature as well again when you order this unit you're going to get the cooler the manual the ac and dc power cables it also comes with a wire basket in here which makes it really uh easy to sort of stack food in here so you can put some food in put the basket on put more food in and you can just grab the basket out so i really like that we use this so much when we're again boondocking or whenever we are in our class a i've seen people take these to the beach and they're eating ice cream off the beach so there's just so many different uses that you can get out of one of these dometic coolers and they're so efficient and as far as the construction of these it is what they call an exo construction frame with heavy-duty bumpers and they are really made for most dometic products are made for like the outdoors and to kind of take a bit of a beating and that's what i've seen from this unit here because we've used it a good bit and we have we have tried to be kind to it but as you know in these type situations they can take bit of a beating so that's it that's the cfx75 and you can get more information about these and you can buy them over at technorv.com if you've got more questions you can chat email with us or you can call us and you can do all that over at technorv.com we wish you safe travels", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2022-06-11T00:34:18Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "Dometic CFX 75

cooler that you can get over at technorv.com this is a 36 liter cooler and that means that you can fit 50 cans in it or whatever that you want into it is a single zone cooler which means that you can either set this up as a refrigerator or you can set it up as a freezer because this will go from refrigerator temperatures all the way down to negative seven degrees fahrenheit but again it is a single zone so if you wanted to set all of this up as a freezer then you could i typically use this one as a cooler and so i've got all kinds of canned drinks and water and a few snacks in here and it's the perfect size for us when we're boondocking i keep this in the back of our ford truck in the back seat and i just powered off the 12 volt and whenever we are in our class a towing the jeep i'll keep this in the jeep so it's got a lot of different uses for it so this can be powered with ac and dc power and so whenever you're on 120 volts ac it's pulling about 0.78 of an amp so these things are very efficient whenever you're on dc power you're pulling about seven and a half amps this unit weighs about 37 pounds and it does come with handles on it that are very heavy-duty and spring-loaded but these handles can be removed and if you'll look here i've actually removed the handles on this side because whenever i put it into my truck i need that extra like inch inch and a half there for it to just fit perfectly in there so you can leave those on or you can take them off whatever you want to do there is fine the measurements on this are you're at 27.32 inches this way right here you're at 16.02 uh inches this way and you're at about 15.67 inches up and down uh this is a what they call an exo frame construction with heavy duty bumper fenders on it and i put this thing through its paces especially when we're out boom docking and we you can beat this thing up pretty good it's very strong very durable and it's one of the kind of the keynote specs about this dometic cooler is that it can take quite a beating out in the field so also a few other things to point out the setup is very easy it comes with a color uh display on the front here and this is going to with this single zone you're basically going to set up what temperature you wanted that if you wanted freezer temperatures or refrigerator temperatures you're going to set all that up here on the front and then you can also adjust it's got a three stage uh battery protection system on it so you can select which stage you want so in other words if you're powering this off of a car and like the car is not running obviously you don't want to deplete that battery down so it's got some features in there to where it'll kind of minimize consumption but go into very efficient mode and if if the voltage gets down too far it'll just cut off it does have bluetooth to where you can set up the cfx app on your phone to where you can make adjustments from your phone so i can change the temperature on this from my phone i can just check in with it make any adjustments to any of the specifications that i want to all right for my phone that's all uh super easy to set up as well so whenever you get this unit you're of course going to get uh the cooler itself uh you're going to get a manual you're gonna get an a six and a half foot ac power cable so if you want to uh plug this directly into a wall outlet you can do that and then it's also going to come with a dc power outlet which i happen to have plugged in right now to my dometic plb40 power supply so it'll come with this here it does not come with the battery this is sold sold separately and so and it also comes with a wire basket as well inside that kind of makes it easy for you to organize uh things so typically when we go out this this cooler or any of the dometic coolers quite frankly are paired perfectly with the plb40 dometic uh battery and so this also has like usb connections and different things like that and it's easy to recharge but when i'm off grid that is what i use here um but if you have other means you can do that otherwise you can get that plb-40 also at technorv.com as well so that's it we love the dometic coolers and we do have them have all of the major models of the cfx series at technorv.com that's the 3555 and the 75 so if you want to check them out get more information then hop on over to

relates to my propane system and my rv here i'm going to be installing the gas stop propane safety device it's the only device on the market that will 100 and automatically shut off the propane to your rv if you have a leak like a line cut or a rupture anything that would be above normal levels of propane usage in your rv this is going to shut it off so i want to show you how easy this is to install you basically just unscrew your propane line from the tank screw on the gas stop device and then attach your propane line back to the gas stop and that's it now i can turn my propane on and then i'm just going to give the uh the gauge here on top of the gas stop about three or four pushes and that that basically pressurized the system and now that's it the gas stop is ready to go now what i'm also going to do is i'm going to be replacing these hoses with this gas gear hose it's got this 90 degree bend in it because you see how once i install this gas stop here you see how much further this comes out and i've got a really tight space in here to push this back in you may have an rv that has like a case that goes on yours so these 90 degree gas gears not only are do they come in like a stainless braided so it's just a higher quality it comes with this nice thick brass 90 degree turn and so i'm just going to disconnect this from the regulator and then i'll screw the gas gear into the regulator and then screw the the gas gear onto the gas stop and then i'm done so i'm just going to go ahead and do this install on the gas gears and then we'll come back whenever it's done and just kind of finish up with everything and keep in mind all this stuff you can get at technorv.com that's where we sell them there and we have all the information you could ever want about these devices if you have any questions you can always call us and ask us so i'm going to go ahead and install my gas gears [Music] so now that my gas gears are installed all i've got to do is put my gas stops on attach my gas gear and then i'll have a nice tight fit here to where this will be able to slide in nice and easy and i will know that my gas stop is protecting my rv and ensuring that it 100 and automatically shuts off propane should there be a leak in the system and these gas stops also have a nice gauge on the top of them you never want to grab the gauge and turn it you always want to grab the collar make sure you turn it nice and tight we'll go ahead and install this back one as well and i'm going to turn these gauges to where they're out just a bit to where i can see them whenever i open it and there's a gasket inside the the gas stop here that you'll see whenever you go to connect uh and you'll want to make sure that's seated in there nicely and it is and then this is just going to circle back around and this this actually twists so i can i can figure out what's what works best for me i'll probably do it like this and slide it up here to where the the gas gear is going to kind of circle around this way to where it's not coming out sorry and we'll get in front of the camera for a second okay tighten that and notice i'm not grabbing the the gauge here i'm pushing on the base here okay okay figure out the route on this one i think i might do the same thing and just turn this okay these are the 12 inch gas gears here they do make an 18 inch one if you need a little bit more of a run i wanted this one tight the 18 inch one would have probably circled out this way a little bit more on the back and i really don't have that that room um so the 12 inch ones worked out just nicely and that's it now i want to i want to do a leak test um so i'll just take some uh a spray bottle with a little bit of soapy water in it and i just make sure i want to check my points where i connected my gas gear to the regulator and then uh i want to just check every connection point just to make sure that there are no leaks and um i will do that uh here off off camera but essentially all i'm doing now is just turning my propane on and remember we're just gonna plunge this three or four times my gauge comes all the way up and that's it and there is again you can get all this at technorv.com the install is really easy and there is no other system on the market you might find something that looks like this but it's just a gauge it doesn't have the ability to automatically cut the propane off in your rv so make sure you get the gas stop brand over at technorv.com and it'll give you again maximum level of peace of mind for your propane system in your rv",

{"id": "ler-a4-hBqI", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "rCEVxa9grvIZLn8-fGCB7dsueak", "transcript": "so we just got done with medona pass at great sand dunes national park and you have to have a four wheel drive because there's a lot of sand and they recommend you air down your tires to 20 psi i usually run 60 in this truck the sand was super soft today i aired down to about 30 and i was fine but there were some people that chose not to air down and got stuck so there's that um we had no problems but i air down with the by air and of course i air back up with the bayer when i'm airing down with the biair i basically just take the gas station style air gun connect it to the valve stem and then just press the release valve and then it'll let air out and then whenever i want to see what the pressure is i just let it go and then i can read where i'm at until i get down to where i want to go so that is what 30 pounds of pressure looks like another reason we run a tire pressure monitoring system by tst of course is because 30 pounds doesn't look much different than 60 pounds to be honest with you so uh anyway i'm gonna hook the by air up and this is the 450 here we don't go anywhere without it actually on our in our four wheeler um we carry an 89 with us a bayer 89 the rbs model which is their current model um the rv model is their older model the rvs is their newest model and that's the kind we run and so basically i'm going to connect this to the batteries on my truck and then very important when you're running your viewer the engine needs to be running okay so i see a lot of people will connect and they'll be that doesn't seem like it's running that strong need to run your engine to keep that amperage up and uh so i'll only need 30 feet of hose on this so i've connected the line to my by air and i'll just connect it to the again the gas station style air hose we'll carry this to the front of the truck look her up [Applause] i've got batteries on both sides of this truck so it doesn't matter which side i'm on but with the 30 foot hose it's it doesn't matter but ah how convenient okay so i'm connected i don't know if you're going to be able to hear this but i want you to hear what this sounds like without the truck running and then i want to turn the truck on now the problem will be the truck will be running you may not be able to get the vibe of uh what it sounds like but listen listen to this okay that's weak okay i know it sounds like it's running and everything's fine i'll turn the engine on then we'll turn it back on and see if you can hear the difference [Applause] okay you ready can you hear how like much stronger it's running and that's that's what it's supposed to sound like so from here love the gas station style air gun this is the 450 model so i am running the tst tire pressure monitoring sensors on here i'll just unscrew those screw on this uh 40 inch extended chuck that comes with the rvs model does not come with the regular rv model so again make sure you get the rvs model it's the only model we carry over at technorb.com so once i connect that it's going to show me my psi and you can see um well i'm a little bit less than 30 so anyway now we're just going to air up i usually run about 60 pounds in these so this will take a bit to do this but we can uh do this and sort of wrap up it after i'm done in the meantime why don't you take in the uh great dunes national park one more thing this national park when the season's up and running they actually have air stations but right now their air stations are not up and running i guess maybe they're waiting for a memorial day or something when the traffic picks up so if you don't if you're airing down and you don't have a compressor like you wouldn't be able to even be able to go up there today so again we don't go anywhere with the bayer anyway so when they told me that i was like no problem we'll be all right all right we're finishing up here and tammy got involved and then you got this little bread tie looking thing to hold it down pretty cool idea felt sorry for me out here holding this i guess okay all right your situation all right got just a little bit more and i'll be at 60 pounds on all four tires uh these are 37 inch tires 13 and a half inches wide on 20 inch rims with a 9 000 pound truck sitting on the tires i was actually at about 27 pounds going to 60 so i had about 33 pounds to go and it was taking me about seven and a half to eight minutes per tire today so uh i don't think it's too bad because i'm doing this all from 12 volt connecting it to my battery uh and actually that is as it relates to tire inflators that's pretty quick so anyway i'm going to uh wrap this up and go ahead and get my tst sensor back on the tire do this put my sensor back on disconnect my by ear off the front of the truck [Music] wrap all this up usually neater than this [Music] uh okay the valley or can get very hot all right right here like very hot so um right when i'm done because we're fixing to get in the truck and leave uh i i typically oh it's hot back here too uh i typically won't put it in the case and then throw the case over it probably be okay uh but i don't like it because it's real hot so what i'm gonna do is i'm just gonna set them by air right here and hose and i'll clean all this up later because miss tammy right there it's ready to go all right there you have it people ready to roll", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2022-05-26T23:00:13Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "Using the VIAIR

{"id": "ceZnb8kGUf0", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "cR-lbp4bahPal6Mpc9cWWVJvYjE", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and in this video i want to talk to you about the southwire portable power stations there are four different models and we have made a series of videos where we're going to talk about each specific model like we will do in this video but as an overview there is a 200 watt hour model a 300 a 500 and an 1100 watt hour model these are all lithium ion batteries they all have built-in inverters so you're going to be able to get that ac and dc power and this is pure sine wave technology so you're going to have clean power for all of your delicate electronics in addition each one of these units can be charged in six different ways and one of those is with an optional solar panel that you can get from techno rv so in this video i want to tell you everything that you need to know about this 1100 series model so let's go ahead and get started with that so this is the 1100 model this is the largest model again it's ul certified lithium-ion pure sine wave so it's going to be good clean power for your electronic devices and it's got that built-in inverter so not only are you going to be able to power your dc dependent devices but you're also going to be able to power those ac dependent devices as well this unit is actually 1166 watt hours and what that means for simplicity purposes let's say i've got a battery pack that's a thousand watt hours and the device that i want to run on it has a wattage rating of say 100 watts that would mean that it would run that item for 10 hours and that's kind of how you need to view watt hours what are you going to be running on it what is the wattage rating for that and that'll determine how long you could run it on this device so when you order this unit what you get in the box is of course your your battery unit you're going to get a dc power supply cigarette lighter style to charge this from a cigarette lighter style port you're going to get an ac power supply to charge this unit from an ac power supply just regular wall plug you're also going to get this barrel tip kit so in case you've got some unique device that might need an adapter this just comes with eight adapters and a lot of people will charge for stuff like this this actually comes with it and then in addition you're going to get the operations and maintenance manual with this this is a very easy unit to use but when you get it from techno rv you are going to get the techno rv learning series which is something that we've put together to make sure that you're successful with this unit and that you really know how to operate the unit so let's talk about the front of this unit and all the ports that you have as it relates to outputs and the display that you get with this unit so this unit comes with three ac power supplies these are just regular wall plugs so if you've got something that operates off a wall plug you've got three of those to work with over here you've also got two usb standard plugs here the 2.4 amp standard usbs and then you have two of the quick charging usbs this is the qc 3.0 you also have the pd 100 watt this is where i would plug in like my uh iphone 12 connection would plug into that so you have that as well you also have your cigarette lighter style plug so if you have something that needs that you've got it and then it has two dc outputs here that are the barrel type so if you have something to operate off that you have those as well and then you have your your solar panel port up here and then you also have your dc uh charging port up here as well you'll notice that you have uh buttons for each one of these power supplies an ac a usb and a dc so that whenever you push that button that's what'll actually will power that section of this unit as it relates to the display it's a color display and this unit is going to tell you how much wattage is being drawn so uh technically you could plug something into all these at the same time but obviously the more you plug in the faster it will deplete it this unit is going to tell you in hours how much longer you have on the this charge so let's say i've got one item plugged in and it says hey on that item you know this is this can run for you know 30 hours and then i plug something else in it'll make that calculation and say oh now you got you know 29 28 hours whatever it is and the more you start plugging in the more it'll make that calculation so that's real nice whenever you're trying to figure out how much more time do i have with this unit with the particular load that i'm drawing from it this unit can be charged with an industry leading six different ways you can charge it with the car charger that comes with it the ac power supply that comes with it it can also be charged with an optional solar panel that you can get at techno rv that's a 100 watt solar panel you can charge it with usb you can also charge it with a generator and you can charge it with uh with ac combined with the pd outlet on here so what i want to do is talk about each one of those and if i was charging this from zero to a hundred percent how long would it take to charge this unit back up if i'm charging this unit with the dc power supply it will take 12 hours the ac power supply is 9.7 hours that usb cpd is 11.7 hours with the solar panel 15 hours a generator is 9.7 hours and when i combine that pd with the ac it'll charge this in 5.3 hours so now let's talk about the measurements and the weight of this unit this unit measures 13.19 inches long 9 inches wide it's eight inches high and it weighs in at 24.7 pounds this unit is good for a thousand charges so a thousand duty cycles and that means that it can go from a hundred to zero charge back up to hundred that's one so that thousand times is industry-leading and southwire uh does this measurement from zero to a hundred percent uh i have seen uh other units on the market that they base theirs on like from zero to eighty percent and uh southwire decided well that doesn't seem right we should do it from zero to a hundred percent so that's a thousand cycles from zero to a hundred percent and that's industry leading this unit also has a two year warranty when you get the unit from techno rv you will have the option to extend this warranty by up to three additional years with the exclusive techno rv warranty program now this is the most powerful unit in the lineup and you know determining you know if this unit is right for you i just wanted to kind of go through some typical scenarios of wattage requirements from some different devices and then how many hours of usage you can get for those particular uh devices and uh so let's and these wattages that i'm going to give you they may not be exact but they're just kind of ballpark figures on these particular devices so let's go ahead and talk about those a little bit you can run a 700 watt coffee maker for 1.7 hours you can run a 32-inch led tv a 55-watt model for 21 hours if you have a cpap machine that's 40 watts you can run that for 29 hours a 725 watt refrigerator for 1.8 hours you can actually run a 800 watt electric griddle for 1.5 hours a 200 watt blender for six hours so as you can see like this unit i mean i didn't even get into like charging like cell phones and different things like that because though obviously it'll do that i was giving you more of those things that are a bit more power hogs and this unit can can absolutely handle it uh if those are the type devices that you want to power now even if you don't have items that you're going to be utilizing this with that have like those higher wattage ratings then your lower wattage rating devices just won't deplete this as fast so now you're talking about like charging up a 10 watt cell phone you can you can run the math on that and see how many times that is i mean it's really just depends on what your uses are and uh and you know how often you would expect to have to recharge this unit and with the 1100 model i can tell you that i have run plenty of devices actually run my dometic cooler off of this for about two and a half days so that's nice we have run all kinds of things on this and it is it's kind of a joy to have to charge it less so this is the southwire solar panel this is a 100 watt 18 volt dc output unit it is monocrystalline and that just simply means that you're going to get more energy per square foot this comes in a nice tough oxford cloth case it comes with a carrying handle and it's quite small because this is a quad fold but while it is not open this unit is 13.79 inches by 17.72 by 1.18 inches now when i open this unit up it'll be 55.51 inches by 17.71 inches by 0.2 of an inch so whenever you uh open this unit up well before i get into that it does have this nice zippered pocket on the front of it and this is where you're going to find your cable to plug this into your southwire portable power it is all just connected right to it so you would take this and plug it into your south wire device in addition it's going to come with an rv ready adapter so that for those of you that have rvs that are wired for this that you could plug this directly into that using this adapter here so that folds up nicely there and so let's go ahead and open this up you just squeeze the sides of the clamp here and it releases it and these are elastic here so when you put them back in you can just draw them tight so release that side release that side and again this is a quad fold unit and you'll notice when you open it up right here it's got legs on the back so that you can stand it up and face it towards where the sun is so if i open the unit up like this then i can take the legs out on the back like this and then your unit will and you just face that wherever the sun is at uh so that's it and then you would have you would basically have uh the power cable going to your battery and a lot of times what i'll do is i'll set this up with the sun coming in from this side and then i'll just set my battery just like right right behind this and uh and then it'll get a nice charge on that and then uh putting it up is quite simple whenever i stand it up the legs just automatically go in and then again the quad fold i just fold it back up take my left elastic band pull it through and it's about the most compact unit that i've seen on the market and again these are great for your southwire portable power units and then also the adapter for rvs that might be ready for a solar panel so that's it that's the solar panel from southwire so that's everything you need to know about the 1100 as always at techno rv we are here for you we want to make sure that your questions are answered you can call chat or email with us and we'd be happy to help you make your decision on which southwire portable power unit is right for you so go over to technorv.com and

{"id": "33IYtQwDvD8", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "7lRknADs_ddCRhQ9yehNfd07R0I", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and in this video i want to talk to you about the southwire portable power stations there are four different models and we have made a series of videos where we're going to talk about each specific model like we will do in this video but as an overview there is a 200 watt hour model a 300 a 500 and an 1100 watt hour model these are all lithium ion batteries they all have built-in inverters so you're going to be able to get that ac and dc power and this is pure sine wave technology so you're going to have clean power for all of your delicate electronics in addition each one of these units can be charged in six different ways and one of those is with an optional solar panel that you can get from techno rv as well so in this video i want to tell you everything that you need to know about the 300 series model so let's go ahead and get started with that so this is the southwire 300 model again it's a ul certified lithium ion battery it's pure sine wave so it's going to be excellent power for your electronic devices and it's got a built-in inverter so not only are you going to be able to power your dc dependent devices but also your ac dependent devices as well this unit here is 296 watt hours and what that means is that each device that you have has a wattage rating and just for simplicity purposes let's say i had a unit that was say 200 watt hours and i had a device that had a wattage rating of 50 i would be able to use it on that particular device for four hours that's kind of how you come to that conclusion so when you order this what are you getting well you're getting the main unit the 300 model here you're also getting a cigarette lighter style car charger to charge this you're also getting an ac style charger just a regular wall plug charger you're also getting a barrel tip adapter kit in case you've got a unique scenario of a particular plug and you might need an adapter this comes with it and then you're going to get the instruction guide and operating guide as far as how to use this unit it's a simple unit to use also whenever you order this unit from techno rv you're going to get the techno rv learning series where we have kind of made our own guide on how to use this we're always going to make sure you're successful whenever you buy anything from techno rv so what can you power on this unit well a lot let's take a look at the front of this unit and see what the ports are so on the 300 unit you get two ac power supplies just regular wall plug power supplies up here on the top you've got a dc input that's where you're gonna charge from dc you're also gonna get two standard usb 2.0.4 amp ports and then you're going to going to get one qc 3.0 which is a quick charging usb port and then you're going to get your type c charging port as well then if you move over here you're gonna have your standard cigarette lighter style plug over here to power something that way and then you're gonna have two five amp like barrel connector uh ports here for dc as well across the top of all these you'll notice a button a dc button a usb button and an ac button and then that's how you activate that little power bank in addition you're going to get an led light this light is extremely bright it comes in a couple of different brightnesses and it also has a flashing mode on it as well for like emergency type situations as far as the display is concerned it's a color display and it is going to display the amount of wattage that's being used so theoretically you could plug something into every one of these ports but as you plug more devices in obviously the number of hours that you have left on this particular unit will begin to diminish so if i plug one thing in it might say i have like 12 hours left and if i plug another thing it might say i have like 11 hours left and the more i plug in it'll make those adjustments for you as you plug different devices in so you'll always know how much power you have with this unit this unit has a leading six different ways to charge this unit you can charge it with a car dc power supply which comes with it just a cigarette lighter in your car to this unit also with the ac power supply that comes with it you can also charge it with an optional solar panel that we'll talk about a little bit later it's a 100 watt solar panel you can also charge it with the quick connect type c and also a generator as well you can also charge this with ac and the quick connect type c at the same time to get a faster charge rate so let's talk about those different charge rates from zero to a hundred percent charge with each one of these different modes of charging when you're charging with the dc it'll charge in four and a half hours with the ac four and a half hours with the usbc charger it's five hours the solar panel is four and a half hours with a generator it's four and a half hours and when you combine the pd with the ac then it'll charge this unit in two and a half hours next up let's talk about the measurements of this unit and how much it weighs the 300 unit is 8.46 inches long it's 6.3 inches wide 7.56 inches high and it weighs in at 7.61 pounds 300 model is good for a thousand charges or duty cycles and this is from a 100 percent down to zero and back up to 100 percent that's one cycle so that's very important because that is a very high number compared to competition and also be aware that uh we've seen some other competitors on the market that'll do their cycle ratings on from 80 to zero and back uh where southwire is like no 100 that should be uh the duty cycle and so it's a thousand cycles and that's industry leading and that's what you get with south wire in addition this unit comes with a two year warranty and when you get this unit at techno rv you will have the option to increase that warranty by up to three years with the techno rv extended warranty program now as you know there's four different models there's a one below this which is the 200 you got the 300 of 500 and 1100 so how do you know if the 300 is right for you and that really just comes down to what do you plan on powering this unit like what devices are you going to be powering uh is it you know just going to be cell phones and cameras and maybe a drone or something like that or are you going to be uh powering things that are higher power consumption type devices one thing that you need to know is that you always you you don't want to since this is a basically 300 watt hours you don't want to power anything with this unit that requires a wattage level of over that that number okay so which is a lot of different things and i just wanted to kind of cover real briefly like some standard type wattage levels for some common devices that you might be using with this and then how long uh how many hours that you could power the device with this for that particular device for example like a phone or a camera that's typically going to be somewhere around 10 watts and this isn't exact you need to make sure of your own devices but if it was 10 watts you could get basically you know 29 uh 30 charges out of this unit if you have a cpap machine and it's it's the 40 watt variety then it'll run it for seven hours uh you can do a 60 watt mini fridge for five hours a 50 watt laptop for six hours uh even a slow cooker uh that's that's rated at about 108 watts you could get three hours off of that so as you can see it's really all about what you need this device for and also it's it's dependent on when you will be able to charge this unit back up i mean if you always are close to a method to charge this unit back up uh then you know you have less worries than somebody that may be like off-grid uh you know for a while that needs to maybe charge phones and different things like that so keep that in mind look at your own wattage ratings of the devices you want to use on this and then you make your decision that way so this is the southwire solar panel this is a 100 watt 18 volt dc output unit it is monocrystalline and that just simply means that you're going to get more energy per square foot this comes in a nice tough oxford cloth case it comes with a carrying handle and it's quite small because this is a quad fold but while it is not open this unit is 13.79 inches by 17.72 by 1.18 inches now when i open this unit up it'll be 55.51 inches by 17.71 inches by 0.2 of an inch so whenever you open this unit up well before i get into that it does have this nice zippered pocket on the front of it and this is where you're going to find your cable to plug this into your south wire portable power it is all just connected right to it so you would take this and plug it into your south wire device in addition it's going to come with an rv ready adapter so that for those of you that have rvs that are wired for this that you could plug this directly into that using this adapter here so that folds up nicely there and so let's go ahead and open this up you just squeeze the sides of the clamp here and it releases it and these are elastic here so when you put them back in you can just draw them tight so release that side release that side and again this is a quad fold unit and you'll notice when you open it up right here it's got legs on the back so that you can stand it up and face it towards where the sun is uh so if i open the unit up like this then i can take the legs out on the back like this and then your unit will and you just face that wherever the sun is at uh so that's it and then you would have you would basically have uh the power cable going to your battery and a lot of times what i'll do is i'll set this up with the sun coming in from this side and then i'll just set my battery just like right right behind this and uh and then it'll get a nice charge on that and then uh putting it up is quite simple whenever i stand it up the legs just automatically go in and then again the quad fold i just fold it back up take my left elastic band pull it through and it's about the most compact unit that i've seen on the market and again these are great for your southwire portable power units and then also the adapter for rvs that might be ready for a solar panel so that's it that's the solar panel from southwire so that's kind of everything you need to know about the 300 again you can get these over at technorv.com and as always we're here to help we're here to help you make your decision and we're here to help you after the sale as well so if you have questions about this unit you can always call chat or email with us we're always happy to help you i hope this has

portable power stations there are four different models and we have made a series of videos where we're going to talk about each specific model like we will do in this video but as an overview there is a 200 watt hour model a 300 a 500 and an 1100 watt hour model these are all lithium ion batteries they all have built-in inverters so you're going to be able to get that ac and dc power and this is

optional solar panel that you can get from techno rv as well so in this video i want to tell you everything that you need to know about the 500 series model so let's go ahead and get started with that so this is the southwire 500 model again this is a ul certified lithium ion battery pure sine wave so it's going to be good clean power for all of your electronic devices and it does have a built-in inverter so you're going to be able to power all of your dc dependent items and your ac dependent items as well this unit right here is actually 515 watt hours i want to explain real quick what that means each one of your devices that you want to power with this will have a wattage rating on it for simplicity purposes let's say something was 200 watt hours a battery pack and let's say i wanted to power something with it that had a 50 watt power rating that means that that would that particular battery would would run that for four hours so keep that in mind this is 515 watt hours so you're getting a lot of power with this one and uh and i am quite sure that this is going to be a good unit for a lot of rvers and campers based on what they want to do now when you get this item what comes in the box you're going to get your of course your unit here you're going to get a dc power supply to charge this with just a cigarette lighter style plug you're going to get a ac charger as well just a wall outlet charging supply you're also going to get this barrel tip kit which uh is included with this and a lot of people won't include this they'll charge extra for this but it comes with this in case you've got some device that needs some kind of adapter this will have you covered uh there and then you will also get a operating and maintenance instruction manual when you get this from techno rv you're also going to get the technology learning series which is a set of instructions that we've put together we always want to make sure that you're successful with what you get from us and that's why we do that these units are really simple to use but again we want to make sure you're successful and do everything that we can to make sure that that happens so let's talk about the ports and the display on the front of this unit here and and sort of what you get here on the 500 unit up here you're going to have a this is a dc input this is where you would charge this unit with say that uh the cigarette lighter style plug that came with the kit you also get two ac power supplies here these are just regular like wall plug type outlets so you get that ac power supply in addition you get three standard usb power supplies the 2.4 amp version which is the standard and then you also get one quick charge usb which is the qc 3.0 and then you also get a type c uh which is basically what i use to charge like my iphone here and then uh over on this side you're going to have a cigarette lighter style uh plug that you can power items with and then you have two dc like barrel style outputs down on the bottom here as well this unit comes with an led light and it does have different dimming levels this is a very bright light and it also has a flashing mode in case you have an emergency uh you could turn that on as far as the display is concerned the color display and it's going to display the the wattage level that's being drawn from it so theoretically you could plug something into all of these at one time and it would power it but the more items that you plug in obviously the more consumption it's taken from the battery and this will actually make that calculation for you and tell you how many hours you have left on this unit so let's say i've got one item plugged in and it says you know i've got you know 20 hours left with that plugged in and then i plug another item in it'll make that calculation and then maybe say well with those two in now you've got 18 hours left and it'll just keep doing that for you so the display is really nice i love that also you'll notice the buttons the ac button usb button dc button you would want to click those to activate that particular power supply section of this unit whenever you go to use it so it's good that they have that on and off switch there and then you have an led button up here as well so that's all the out power supplies how about the end for charging okay now this has an industry leading six different ways that you can charge this uh you can charge this again with your dc power supply that comes with it uh that's one your ac power supply that comes with it you can pull charge it with an optional uh solar panel a southwire solar panel that's optional or we actually do have a kit where the 500 actually includes this solar panel but that's a 100 watt solar panel and we'll talk a little bit more about that here in just a little bit you can also charge it via usb and then you can charge it with a generator as well and then you can also charge it with the uh with the the quick charge and ac at the same time the usb quick charge and the ac at the same time and so let's talk about if you were to charge it with each one of those different modes how quickly you can go from zero back to a hundred percent if you were going to charge this with the dc power supply you could charge this up in 5.3 hours the ac power supply is 4.3 hours the uh usbc is 8.6 hours with a solar panel 7 hours a generator 4.3 hours and when you combine the pd and the ac you can charge this in 2.9 hours now let's talk about the measurements of this unit right here and how much it weighs the 500 is 10.2 inches long 6.5 inches wide 8 inches high and weighs in at 11 pounds so even with all that power 11 pounds i mean this thing is very portable and uh and very light and it's got a very small footprint this unit is good for a thousand charging cycles from a hundred percent to zero all the way back up to a hundred and that's industry leading and uh that's important because uh some people state duty cycles from zero to eighty percent and south wire says now it's it should be a hundred right and so uh just so you know this is a thousand cycles from 100 to zero back to a hundred this unit also comes with a two year warranty and when you get it at techno rv you do have an option to extend that warranty by up to three years so is this particular unit right for you well it depends on what you want to power and again we've talked about those wattage levels of the different things that you may want to power uh and you know if it's obviously if it's simple things like you know phones and uh you know tablets and charging cameras and a drone different things like that obviously you've got no worries uh if you get it you you get into things like uh you know electric griddles and things like that they can have a much higher wattage rating then you know that's where obviously you want to double check that to make sure that that this unit would be appropriate for that but for the most part this unit is going to be good for most people but i did want to give you an example of some wattage levels of some devices and how long this unit might run those particular devices and these wattage levels that i'm giving you are not exact but it'll give you kind of a baseline to go with so for example you could run a 32 inch led tv that's 55 watts for 9.4 hours you could run a 200 watt blender for 2.6 hours if you have a cpap machine that's the 40 watts you could run that for 13 hours if you're charging laptop that may be in the 50 watt range you can get 10 charges out of that 60 watts mini fridge for 8.6 hours so that's just a few examples of some items and again you need to check the wattage loads on your particular devices so that you would know but that gives you a good idea so this is the southwire solar panel this is a 100 watt 18 volt dc output unit it is monocrystalline and that just simply means that you're going to get more energy per square foot this comes in a nice tough oxford cloth case it comes with a carrying handle and it's quite small because this is a quad fold but while it is not open this unit is 13.79 inches by 17.6 by 1.18 inches now when i open this unit up it'll be 55.51 inches by 17.71 inches by 0.2 of an inch so whenever you uh open this unit up well before i get into that it does have this nice zippered pocket

side and then i'll just set my battery just like right right behind this and uh and then it'll get a nice charge on that and then uh putting it up is quite simple whenever i stand it up the legs just automatically go in and then again the quad fold i just fold it back up take my less elastic band pull it through and it's about the most compact unit that i've seen on the market and again these are great for your southwire portable power units and then also the adapter for rvs that might be ready for a solar panel so that's it that's the solar panel from southwire so that's everything you need to know about the 500 and when you get this from techno rv you got to know we're always here to help you so even if you're trying to make a decision on which unit's right for you you can always call chat and email with us and we're happy to help you make that decision and after you make your purchase of course we'll be there for you as well and i hope that's been helpful and we wish you safe

portable power stations there are four different models and we have made a series of videos where we're going to talk about each specific model like we will do in this video but as an overview there is a 200 watt hour model a 300 a 500 and an 1100 watt hour model these are all lithium ion batteries they all have built-in inverters so you're going to be able to get that ac and dc power and this is

optional solar panel that you can get from techno rv as well so in this video i want to tell you everything that you need to know about the 200 series model so let's go ahead and get started with that so this is the southwire portable power 200 model again this is a ul certified lithium-ion battery pure sine wave which is what you want and it does have that built-in inverter into it which is going to allow you to get ac power in addition to dc power now this is actually a 222 watt hour unit and i want to kind of explain what that means all of your devices are going to have a wattage requirement and whatever that wattage requirement is you can basically divide into that 222 watt hours so for example to make the math easy if this was just a straight 200 watt hour and i had a device that required 50 watts then i would be able to run that on this for four hours so that's kind of how you need to look at that whenever you start deciding is the 200 right for you or the other models the 300 the 500 or even the 1100 so that's how you determine basically the watt hours as it relates to this and again it's 222 watt hours when you get this unit and unbox it what you're going to get with it is of course your battery pack with the built-in inverter you're going to get an ac power plug with it you're going to get a dc power plug with it and you're going to get this eight tip barrel connector adapter kit in case there's something that you have that doesn't quite fit with this this will help you with that in addition you're going to get a operating manual when you get this from technorv.com we you will get our technology learning series and we're going to make sure you're successful with this it's very easy to use there's not a whole lot to it but we always want to make sure you're taken care of as an option there is a solar panel that you can get it doesn't come with the 200 but you can buy this as an option and we'll talk a little bit more about that here in a bit so let's talk about all the outlets that you get on the front of this and a little bit about the display as well as it relates to the outlets that you get uh you do have your input dc here for your charging the 200 comes with two ac outlets so this is going to be just like a standard wall plug right here you're going to get two standard usb ports here the 2.4 amp which is your standard usb and then you're also going to get the quick charge usb as well the 3.0 and then you're going to get your type c connection as well which is what i actually used to charge my iphone 12 with and over here you're going to have the standard cigarette lighter style plug and then you're also going to have a built-in led light here which is nice and that comes with different dimming options and one that also flashes for emergencies and then on your display here that's a nice color display it's going to give you your watts that you're pulling it's also going to tell you how many more hours of battery life you have left based on how much you have plugged in here because technically you could have as many devices plugged into this at one time as you have connection points here and each time you plug an additional device in the display recalculates how much longer the battery is going to last based on that particular load so that's extremely nice to know there in addition you have two five amp barrel style dc connectors uh here as well and then you have your your buttons for each one of these different uh forms of power you have your dc button your usb button and your ac button to actually activate that part of the panel now let's talk about all the different ways that you can charge this unit and this is one of those industry leading type things there are six different ways that you can charge this first you can charge it with your uh cigarette lighter from your car you can also charge it with the optional southwire solar panel you can charge it with the ac plug that comes with this unit as well you can also charge it via the type cpd usb and then you can also charge it with a generator so six different ways that you can apply power to this unit and uh so you'll you'll never be without as far as that's concerned now let's talk about the time it takes to charge this with each one of these different uh charging methods when you're charging with the dc cigarette lighter style plug it'll charge in 5.3 hours and this is this is from 0 to 100 if you're charging with the ac plug it's 4.3 hours the usbc is 8.6 hours if you're charging with the solar panel the 100 watt solar panel that's seven hours a generator is 4.3 hours and then you can also charge it with ac and the usb c pd and if you use both of those at the same time it'll charge in 2.9 hours all right now let's talk about the measurements and the weight of this unit this unit is 8.46 inches in length 6.3 inches wide and 7.56 inches high and it weighs in at 6.6 pounds the southwire 200 is good for a thousand charges and that's from 100 down to zero and all the way back up and uh i will just caution you about that that some people play with those numbers to where it might be like at 80 percent to zero or something southwire does all their measurements on all the way to 100 percent down to zero and back up and that's a thousand uh charges and uh and that is industry leading it also comes with a two year warranty and uh so you'll definitely be covered with that and whenever you purchase this from techno rv you will have an option to extend that warranty up to three additional years if you'd like so while the southwire 200 is the lower power option in the lineup it still has a lot of power to do a lot of what you may need to do and this may be the right unit for you so how do you determine that well you need to try and figure out what are the things that you're going to want to uh run off of this and one thing you always want to make sure is you're going to need to to know like i mean if you're doing things like cell phones and charging cameras and things like that of course you're going to be be covered but if you start getting into things that are like high heat producing things let's say you wanted an electric griddle like for example can be like 800 watts well you don't want to run anything on a 200 watt hour unit that is more than that 200 watt hours in this case it's 222 watt hours so if you were like well i've got this particular device that's say 250 watts well then you would want to move up to the 300 model uh but with that said i did want to just kind of review in general what some items might draw so that you kind of have an idea but these are not exact and if you know they're specific things like maybe a cpap machine that you want to run you really need to go and look at what that what rating is in general terms here's an example of some wattage of some devices and how long they would run on this device here you could charge a typical phone or camera for about 22 charges because they are about 10 watts a laptop could be maybe 50 watts so you could charge that for four hours uh a slow cooker that was was say at 108 watts you could actually run that for a couple of hours if your cpap machine was 40 watts you could actually run that for five and a half hours now if you need to run that for long if you need to run your cpap for longer than that then you know maybe you get the 500 series and it'll of course run it longer than to get you through a whole night so those are just some examples and again those are not exact wattages for every device that you might have but you could look at that for yourself to make that determination and if this unit's right for you or if you need to get a higher watt hour unit from southwire so this is the southwire solar panel this is a 100 watt 18 volt dc output unit it is monocrystalline and that just simply means that you're going to get more energy per square foot this comes in a nice tough oxford cloth case it comes with a carrying handle and it's quite small because this is a quad fold but while it is not open this unit is 13 13.79 inches by 17.72 by 1.18 inches now when i open this unit up it'll be 55.51 inches by 17.71 inches by 0.2 of an inch so whenever you open this unit up well before i get into that it does have this nice zippered pocket on the front of it and this is where you're going to find your cable to plug this into your southwire portable power it is all just connected right to it so you would take this and plug it into your south wire device in addition it's going to come with an rv ready adapter so that for those of you that have rvs that are wired for this that you could plug this directly into that using this adapter here so that folds up nicely there and so let's go ahead and open this up you just squeeze the sides of the clamp here and it releases it and these are elastic here so when you put them back in you can just draw them tight so release that side release that side and again this is a quad fold unit and you'll notice when you open it up right here it's got legs on the back so that you can stand it up and face it towards where the sun is uh so if i open the unit up like this then i can take the legs out on the back like this and then your unit will and you just face that wherever the sun is at uh so that's it and then you would have you would basically have uh the power cable going to your battery and a lot of times what i'll do is i'll set this up with the sun coming in from this side and then i'll just set my battery just like right right behind this and uh and then it'll get a nice charge on that and then uh putting it up is quite simple whenever i stand it up the legs just automatically go in and then again the quad fold i just fold it back up take my less elastic band pull it through and it's about the most compact unit that i've seen on the market and again these are great for your southwire portable power units and then also the adapter for rvs that might be ready for a solar panel so that's it that's the solar panel from southwire so that's everything you need to know about the 200 model if you have questions you can always email chat or call us over at technorv.com and of course when you go to buy your southwire unit go to technorv.com we've got them over there we've got plenty of them in stock and we would be glad to send you one out so until next time safe travels", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2022-05-25T23:19:31Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg",

{"id": "WPvDYSowjUo", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "LkGUMbQtAVjo2fMpZ9nqhuAKZ_E", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and in this video i wanted to do a comparison of the lineup of the southwire portable power units uh the different units are there's a unit that's called the 200 the 300 the 500 and the 1100 all of these are ul certified lithium ion batteries they are all pure sine wave which means it's going to be good clean power for your electronics they all have built-in inverters which means that they're all going to be able to power your ac dependent devices like wall plug type items and then they're also going to be able to power your dc dependent items now the differences in these sizes relates to the rating as it relates to what hours the 200 is 222 watt hours the 300 is 296 watt hours the 500 is 515 watt hours and the 1100 is 1166 watt hours now what are you going to get when you order these each one of these will of course come with the battery unit and then you're also going to get a dc power supply to charge the unit up it's a cigarette lighter style you will also get an ac power plug just a wall outlet plug to charge the unit up you'll also get a barrel tip kit in case you've got something that you have that you need an adapter for that actually comes with each one of these units and then of course you'll get your operating and instruction manual with your unit now any of these units can be bought at technorv.com and when you order from us we're going to send you our learning series and that's our own guide to sort of we just want to make sure you're successful with whatever you buy from us so we put our own instructions together to hopefully make it a little easier on you now we've talked about the different what hours of each one of these but what does that really mean each device that you want to power will have a wattage rating on it and just for simplicity purposes let's say we had a battery that was 200 watt hours and i wanted to power something the power rating on what i want to power is say 50 watts that means that i can run that 50 watt item on that 200 watt hour device for four hours okay so you basically just divide the two numbers together and uh and so that's kind of how you need to think about it whenever you're looking at which one of these units is right for you is like what are you going to be powering on this are you going to be powering things that are like energy hogs like electric griddles uh you know if you may want to run a a tv a hair dryer a coffee maker or something like that now the wattage on those is going to be much higher than say charging a cell phone that may be in like like 10 watts and the other thing to consider is maybe you're not using like these energy hogs but you just don't want to recharge your battery as much so i mean you could get the 1100 and be just charging you know low consumption items or powering low consumption items and you would be able to do that for much longer without recharging it than with say the 200. so those are all things to consider the other thing to consider is that you don't want to exceed the the rating on any of these units with a particular item that you want to power so for example let's say there's something that you want to power you want to be able to open your garage door at home maybe and if there's a power outage well that might be a thousand watts so if you wanted to do that you know you would need to get the the 1100 watt one right because uh that thousand watts exceeds the the 515 from the 500 and down so that's another thing that you you want to consider is is you don't want to exceed that overall wattage rating on any of these units uh as well as it relates to the displays on all these they're all color displays and they're all displaying how many watts is being drawn from the unit as you plug items in and it's going to tell you how many hours you have left based on what you've got plugged in so if i've got one item plugged into this 500 depending on what its wattage is maybe it says hey i can do that for say 15 hours and then and then if i plug another item and another item and another item then it's going to run that calculation in real time and tell you hey now with all these items now you don't have 15 hours anymore maybe you got 10 right so all of them do that and then as it relates to the ports on the front of them they all have ac wall outlet style uh plugs uh and but they just may have a different amount of those like the 1100 has three wall outlet ac style plugs uh whereas as from here down they each have two they're all going to have usb style plugs the 2.4 variety which is more of your standard and then the 3.0 as well and then it's also going to have that quick charge usb like what i charge my apple iphone with they're all going to have a cigarette lighter style plug if you have something that needs that it'll have it and then it's got two barrel plugs for dc as well if you have a unique situation that might need that now the 200 300 and 500 all have a built-in led light that can be uh adjusted as it relates to the the dimness they're actually very bright and then they've also got a flashing mode whereas the 1100 does not come with the the led light all of these units can be charged with an industry leading six different ways you can charge it with the your your cigarette lighter out of your car you can charge it with a wall outlet plug that comes with the kit you can charge it with usb a generator or you can do ac plus the pd outlet on here you can do both of those at the same time to charge it actually quicker in addition all of these will work with the south wire 100 watt solar panel this is a quad fold solar panel it's 100 watts and this is sold separately but it will work with all of these units here um to charge your unit solar with solar panel and so and we've got another video on that now i've made videos individual videos on each one of these items so if you want to go look at like more specific details on each one of them you can do that but i did want to also talk about the different measurements on these and and how much they weigh so let's go ahead and do that the 200 is 8.46 inches in length 6.3 inches wide 7.56 inches high and it weighs in at 6.6 pounds the 300 is 8.46 inches in length 6.3 inches wide and 7.56 inches high and it weighs in at 7.61 pounds the 500 is 10.2 inches in length 6.5 inches wide and 8 inches high and it weighs in at 11 pounds the 1100 is 13.19 inches long 9 inches wide 8 inches high and weighs in at 24.7 pounds so you can get all these units over at techno rv and we're happy to help you with your decision making process you can call chat or email with us the solar panel again is optional with all these however we do have a kit with the 500 that includes the solar panel so you can keep an eye out for that if you want the solar panel with the 500 but again the solar panel will work with any one of these so we're always here to help hop on over to technorv.com check them out and as always safe travels", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2022-05-25T23:19:24Z",

know about the clear source ultra model this is a whole rv water filtration system and you can get these over at technorv.com when you order one of these you're going to get this entire assembly already put together this the ultra comes with three filters that are already pre-installed in your unit you're going to get a canister wrench so that whenever you need to change your filters out that will make that a lot easier you'll have a user guide and then you're also when you order from techno rv you're going to get the techno rv learning series which is a guide we put together to make sure that you are successful with this unit uh you'll also get our five star support we do provide free shipping this unit comes with a one-year warranty and at technorv.com we do offer that you can extend that by three additional years with our exclusive techno rv warranty program all right let's get into the different stages of filtration installation is easy you've got an inlet from your water supply and then you've got your output that goes into your rv so all the water going into your rv is going to come through this system uh the water will start out into into stage one and stage one is a five micron rust inhibiting filter so this is going to trap a lot of sediment other materials that can potentially leave deposits in your plumbing so this is the best way to start on a filtration system once it goes through stage one it moves into stage two this is a 0.5 micron carbon block filter this is going to reduce bacteria and it's also going to improve taste and smell the water leaves stage two goes into stage three this is kind of what makes the ultra special this is actually a a virus guard uh filter uh in stage three and this filter is uses electrically charged adhesives and it's like a coating that traps volatile organic compounds bacteria heavy metals cysts and viruses so by the time the water leaves stage three you've got the cleanest safest drinking water that you can possibly have throughout your entire rv and uh quite honestly there's no other model on the market that that even even comes close to the clear source so let's talk about the structure here uh clear source has built a quality unit here this is an american made structure here it is a powder coated steel and they also use uh stainless steel uh fittings so from a plumbing standpoint you're kind of getting the the best of the best with this and it's truly built for for a lifetime of use as far as the measurements on this unit the unit is 18.75 inches wide it is uh 15.25 inches tall the depth of it is 7.5 inches it weighs 28 pounds so it's very portable and the flow rate of the ultra is about four and a half gallons per minute uh so you're not going to have any issues with flow rate as it relates to once that water hits your rvs and your spigots and things like that uh you're going to have plenty of pressure once it leaves this system here the filter cartridges are designed to last for 2 000 gallons so depending on how much you rv will depend on when you need to change these out if you you know are rving uh if you just rv a few weekends a year uh and then maybe a week out of the summer you'll probably get you know a year out of it if you're every weekend and a couple of weeks out of the summer maybe twice a year if you're a full-time rv or you you potentially would want to change this out every two to three months but again stick with the 2 000 gallons rating and whatever that is for you that's how long these are going to last and then once the filters are ready to be changed out then you just buy a filter pack from techno rv and then you just change them out and changing it out is really easy and then you're back up and running again so as it relates to clean safe drinking water the clear source ultra model is really the top of the line you're just not going to get any safer cleaner drinking water as it relates to a whole rv system and so you'll want to make sure that you buy your clear source at technorb.com because uh when you do that you're going to get we offer free shipping you're going to get the techno rv learning series so we're going to make sure

to know about the clear source premier model this is a whole rv water filtration system that you can get at technorv.com and when you buy one here's what you're going to get you're going to get this fully assembled uh unit right here this one's going to come with two filters and these filters are pre-installed you're going to get the canister wrench so when you need to change your filters out you'll have that you'll get a user's guide and when you order from techno rv you're going to get our learning series which is our own guide to make sure that you're successful with this you're going to get our five star support we're going to provide free shipping this unit does come with a one year warranty and something exclusive with techno rv is you can extend that up to three years or three additional years with our exclusive warranty program so that's everything you get whenever you order this over at techno rv so let's get into what this actually does so the clear source premier is a two-stage filtration system the install is easy you've got an inlet from your water source and then you've got your output that goes to the rv as the water comes in it funnels through the two stages of filtration your first stage of filtration is a five uh micron filter and this this is going to trap uh sediment uh like your larger particulates is going to reduce heavy metals it's going to uh also improve the taste and smell of the water as it flows out of stage one into stage two this is where things really get good because this is a 0.2.2 micron filter and so uh and this is an absolute micron rating at 0.2 and what this means is that it's very effective against bacteria i wanted to point out the absolute because uh some water systems use a nominal uh rating on the micron and that means that if say somebody's 0.5 nominal that means that it's there's 0.5 but there's also pores that are larger than the 0.5 when you get an absolute like this one which is 0.2 it means there's nothing larger than 0.2 as far as the pores in the filter and actually there there can be some that are less than that so it is a tremendous uh rating for a water filtration system and quite honestly there's no other filtration system whole rv filtration system on the market uh that can can compete with that so let's get into the the frame and kind of the construction of this this the frame of this is a american-made it's a powder-coated steel and clear source uses uh stainless steel connection points so as it relates to just plumbing supplies i mean you're kind of you're kind of getting the best here and this is is literally uh built for a lifetime uh with the way that they have have constructed this the measurements of this unit right here the the uh the width is is 15 inches right here the height is 15.25 the depth is uh seven and a half this way and then it weighs it weighs 24 pounds okay so you can you can move this around and it's very very portable the flow rate on this unit is six to six and a half gallons per minute so you're gonna have plenty of flow rate uh but we we've we've used this we've talked to many people that use this and uh there's no effect on you know your your pressure or you know like your shower pressure or anything like that so you'll be good there these uh filter cartridges are rated for 2 000 gallons so if you're uh a weekend every now and again a couple of weeks out of the summer you can likely get a year out of it if you're more frequent than that and you're like every weekend and many a month out of the summer or something then you may change them out a couple of times a year if you're a full-timer i mean you could be looking at changing this out every two to three months but uh it really depends on you and and uh but the rating is 2 000 gallons per filter once your filters have depleted their two thousand gallons of use you just replace the filters you're gonna you're gonna have your filter wrench here and then you can just buy additional cartridges from technorby.com it's really simple to take these off put another one in and you're back up and running as i've stated the installation uh is is really easy on this again there's just an end there's an out you turn the water on and you're good to go so that is uh sort of everything you need to know about the clear source it's the premier edition uh be sure to get this

a lot of the same stuff that you'll find on techno rv that you'll want to put on your own rv right and so she has convinced me that that i won't sound like a salesperson well we do have some of the stuff already from the motorhome but coming from a 50 amp motorhome to a 30 amp truck camper the transfer is not just like oh let's take all our stuff from the rv and just put it in the truck camper there are some changes we're having to make with our previous setup and things we're having to add that we never had to use in the motorhome so okay so let's do it because uh there's a lot um but this this could be useful so uh the first thing is tire pressure monitoring system um the the you know the truck camper i'll have the camper i'm also towing a trailer and i haven't ever rv'd without a tire pressure monitoring system now on the motorhome we had flow-through sensors on the actual motorhome and we had cap sensors on the jeep and the flow-through sensors can only be used on metal valve stems which wasn't a problem on the motorhome but the truck nor the trailer have metal valve stems so we're not going to be able to transfer flow through we're actually going to be all caps this time so all cap sensors um i think we'll probably get the new cap um sensors because when we had the rtst it's years ago and they actually upgraded i guess a year ago yeah so we'll put all new cap sensors it'll still work with our existing monitor yeah and so basically uh for us it's about if we start to have a tire issue um and let's say we run over a nail and the tire starts to lose pressure um when you lose pressure the your temperature of the tire is going to go up because there's more surface area of that tire on the ground and creates more resistance creates more heat then you can have a blowout and so that's what a tire pressure monitoring system does it alarms you as the issue starts to occur so hopefully you have time to get off the road before that blowout occurs and that's typically what happens yeah and even though our truck comes with you know the internal sensor and you know on the dash it'll tell you if you're low in pressure we're still going to put them on the truck because like you mentioned temperature is another indicator that there could be issues and your truck's not going to tell you if your temperature if your tires are running hot per se plus having that immediate alarm where if you're not paying attention to the panel so we are actually putting them on the truck even though they have an existing internal one that came with ford i guess and the trailer yeah if the tire pressure goes low on the truck it like it throws up this weird little yellow light and i would rather it just alarmy let's just get it over with right i got a problem yes and because our spare is going to be so critical because we choose we're choosing to be a little bit more remote um we'll probably put it on the spare as well just to make sure we always have that ready for sure uh does you know good to have something telling you have low tire pressure if you don't have something to air your tires up here so we will have the valley air on board uh i mean i've had the vayr 450 the valley air has a whole line of different models that are right for whatever your situation is what kind of rv you have i've always had the 450 model for that's made for the big class a's i already own it i'm not going to go get another one so i'm just going to take that one with us probably a little bit bigger than what i would normally have if i was just going and buying it new for a truck camper but the 450 is an awesome one and that's what we will be taking along with us and you're used to um technically we could probably get away with the 300 but you are more you like all the extra accessories that come with the 400 and 450 like the gas style um air gun and the extra hose and everything like that so um that'll be nice to have even though we 450 is probably overkill the extra accessories are going to be nice to have i like the extra accessories uh okay i'm looking at my list here um of course we'll have a surge guard on board uh you know we're hoping to be off the grid a lot more in the truck camper but there will be times that we'll be plugging into um shore power and we i don't care what rv we're in we will never plug into power without a an electrical protection system and so we have the surge guard so we'll be using the uh 34 931 yeah we actually have to get a new one because it's a 30 amp and get the adapter to go in case we're the 50 amp power correct um so we'll have that on board oh the level mate now this is a this is actually um something new that we have on technology it's not a new product um but techno rv we're excited that we're kind of the exclusive retail seller of this and uh and so the level mate's been around for a bit and a lot of people have been excited about this product for a long time it helps the leveling process just to make it much easier you can go watch one of our videos on it but with the truck camper i'm really excited to have the level mate on board because uh when we get to a location um you know i don't have like jacks that are gonna auto level me right so i'm gonna need to find a parking place if we're off grid or something that is the most level i can find right so i can drive around looking at my level mate app and be like okay maybe i'm only two or three inches off you know to my passenger side in this location right because the camper is going to stay on the truck the majority of the time it's not like a travel trailer where you park it you know in the it's going to be by itself it's really going to be about finding where the truck is most level which will be super helpful yeah and then i'll have me some some uh some form of blocks on board to where if i'm off just a little bit where i'm at i can just run my truck tires up on it uh get it level and then if i if i do end up taking this off of the bed of the truck um then i can use the level mate to make sure it's level just sitting on his jacks right and that's that's better for the jacks too because as they the jacks don't always deploy at the same time at the same rate and so this will help me kind of keep them on on track there uh the rear observation camera we use the vision works um camera we look for a good wireless system for years and we refused to sell the other ones that were on the market because when we tested them they just we just didn't feel like they were a good quality product too much negative feedback on losing signal and some other things pixelating and the quality of the picture and we're going to we're going to actually put a vision works on the back of the trap the camper itself in case we're not towing the trailer with it but we're also going to put one on the back of the trailer because that will technically be our rear view mirror since you obviously are not going to be able to see out of the rearview mirror right anymore um so and it it will allow you to see both monitors it'll up to i think four yeah four cameras so yeah and the northern light here it actually came with a rear camera on it uh it's a furion brand and i'm swapping it out because i've i've heard too much feedback and then when we tested i'm not going to get into slamming another brand i'm just saying that vision work is is vision works is the brand that that you know i'm going to use because the uh clarity on the screen is it's very brilliant and uh the night vision the night vision leaps and bounds above anything else i've ever seen the wireless signal is awesome too so if you're looking for a rear observation camera they're the smart plug so this comes with a twist style type plug for me to plug my electrical into if i'm plugging into shore power and these twist lock style plugs i don't like them i definitely don't like them i don't i don't want to say i don't have the patience for them but yeah i don't i don't like the uncertainty of them are they connected is it tight enough i don't i don't did i twist it enough you stripped the little thing strips out and those twist lock style plugs they were actually designed um in manufacturing a lot of years back uh when people used to plug into like overhead plugs really yeah it was a twist slot you would uh twist it and then it would stay plugged in like uh it wouldn't fall out yeah and so somewhere along the way the rv industry adopted that's that and then that's kind of how that got started but the smart plug is just a better design it offers it's it's got thicker pins so you have better electrical transfer less heat on the plug and you are seeing the shift i mean when we were at the tampa show earlier this year i think airstream now uses the smart plug exclusively um you're starting to see manufacturers um move away from the twist style plus blocks and go to the smart plug for all the reasons that you just mentioned yeah they're starting to realize maybe that wasn't a great idea you know 50 years ago just stupid to adopt whatever was in the manufacturing plant uh okay gps yes so we use the garmin 890 in the motorhome and we will use it in the truck camper as well because eric chose to make our truck a monster truck well it's got 37 inch tires with a five and a half inch suspension lift so we're like 12 feet tall the truck camper's 12 feet but we're going there yeah so we're definitely gonna have to pay attention over um passes and tunnels and all that type stuff but the thing i'm enjoying about it now that i've because i've never had to look for propane stations because we never had propane on board with the motorhome i've never had to look for laundromats i've never had to look for dump stations i've never had to look for any of those things that are going to be now important for me yes um so the points of interest in the garment i've been kind of researching and looking there's so many different points of interest for those type things and the ioverlander the ioverlander app has that it also has a lot of dispersed camping and places that you can get outside of campgrounds that we've never really utilized but it's going to be nice to have all that together while still focusing on hey don't take me anywhere that's you know shorter than 12 feet yep yep love the garmin um okay so the soft start for our ac unit this uh the truck camper has a 10 000 btu our ac are our travel trailer it's a 27 foot forest river that we have it has a 13.5 btuac and then of course our motorhome has a 15 000 btu so this one's smaller but with that said we are going to install the soft start on it because with us being off grid we may be at times running a 2000 watt generator to run the ac if necessary and if it's hot at night it's necessary let's just say it so the soft start installed on the ac will um virtually eliminate that spike that amperage spike at startup when an ac kicks on that's typically what will flip trip the breaker and the soft start levels out that startup cycle to where you don't get that amperage spike and the way that it does that is a typical um rv you know may take a sixth of a second or so to fire up and to do that it's got to have this big amperage spike right and so uh with the soft start it just takes like maybe a third of a second right so it doesn't sound like a big deal but it is yeah you you would never tell you're not going to know it's all under a second but it totally brings that amperage spike down to where if you're running off a 2000 watt generator on a unit like this that you'll be able to um do that i mean they've got 2 200 watt generators 25 i don't know which one we'll bring smaller the smaller we can bring the less weight it is and the less space it takes so you know everything in the truck camper and even smaller rvs or yeah you know it goes small what about propane safety we didn't have propane in the class the motorhome was completely all electric so our only experience with propane is the travel trailer and we haven't done many trips in it but it does have gas stop on it but here we're gonna be propane oven propane heat we've not done that since the fifth wheel which was five or six years ago yeah so that'll be a new addition to put two of the gas stops on the two propane tanks so the gas stop propane safety devices basically they just connect right onto your propane tank and then you take your propane line and connect it to the other side of this gas stop device and it provides 100 automatic shut off uh should you have um some kind of leak like a line rupture or a line cut or something like that and um but it will allow enough flow for you obviously to do what you need to in your rv make sense uh so it really is is covering you if there's you know again like a line cut or a rupture or something like that and you know this this product is you know what two three years old now and man it is so popular amongst rvers because it's it's not an expensive product it's like hey if i can put this on here and i'm i'm guaranteed that it's going to cut me off one less thing to worry about it's just more pieces and ours is in a bay so we have plenty of clearance we'll just be able to put the gas stops one on each of the tanks the rockwood we had to actually get the gas gear extension 90 degree hose because it fit under a cover that was really tight and now we actually have the stainless braided hoses and rubber hoses online but we won't have to use those on this we might set up you think so we'll have to see i was looking at it the other day i figured we had enough space it's a pretty tight area in there maybe not maybe not but uh but maybe okay okay staying connected on the road we still got to stay connected because well we work from time to time and so the pep wave cellular router in the motorhome we had the pep wave max transit duo cat 12 and the pointing antenna eric did a we did an install video of course we're leaving the antenna on the roof of the the motorhome when we sell it so the decision on which pep way we're going to use we're still looking at some they've released some new ones recently and we're kind of just evaluating what would be best for us but we will definitely have a pep wave router um especially being out away from sell signal more um we're gonna need yeah we're gonna we're gonna do the pep wave and and that's going to cover us in in most situations and then we're going to carry along a wee boost cellular booster we'll probably do the one with the stationary boom um directional antenna that's not something we necessarily used on the big rv um we had just the omnidirectional but i think with us getting way off grid having that omnidirectional to kind of cut out the 360 degree noise and have it just focus in one direction i think that'll probably be better for us and i'm looking forward to just how those are all going to work together and making some videos on it because staying connected there's so many different ways you can do it and everybody does it a little bit differently so i think this will be a good learning experience for us this year on being really far from sell signal and what is the best way to overcome that so that's everything we're putting on the truck camper and i'll just i'll just do this one thing forgot one thing what i forget we are putting the berkey in the of course did i not put that on my list no you did not the travel berkey that should have been the number one thing on there we are there there's counter space for it we had it in the motor home um for a lot of reasons first of all we just like the water from it second of all we don't have to carry water bottles with us so that's less weight it is portable so i can move it you know around we love the berkey yeah and with us being off grid a lot uh don't be putting pond water i know you're gonna say i'm gonna put pond water right now i've gotta put palm water in and you're never going to do it because it's going to funnel through the berkey and it'll just be clean water to you uh so anyway so that's everything we're putting on there and here's here's my here's my say i'll only do one sales picture okay everything that i just said it's all at technorv.com so if you're interested in any of that you can go check it out and then we have uh our customer service reps can answer questions for you we've got a lot more videos on all this stuff and we are adding a few more things to not only the truck camper but to techno rv in the upcoming months and so that's going to be exciting to share yeah this is we're in february yeah right now things in the next couple months that will be added to this that is also well this year is going to be we're going to add a lot this year i know but i'm excited about a couple of them specifically okay that's it everybody uh we hope you are all being safe out there and we will see you all down the road", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2022-03-07T20:34:55Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "Stocking the New Truck Camper at TechnoRV",

{"id": "AAPUzH7t4Ak", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "J_pAskyLh8k6FohDlhMEcgGixnA", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and in this video i'm going to unbox the levelmate pro here and the levelmate pro plus we'll talk about what's in the boxes and explain the differences in the two so kind of out of the gate here the levelmate pro is a app based device that can work on apple or android and it's going to assist you in leveling your rv when you get to your final destination and every rver knows that the two pain points in rving that hit the top of the list are parking your rv and getting it level and the levelmate pro hits a home run as it relates to making it much easier for you to level your rv so what comes in these two different models and what is the differences so we do have the levelmate pro plus and the levelmate pro so we'll just go ahead and open these up here and the first thing that you'll know notice is that there is a quick start guide that comes with each one of these and there is a qr code to get you to the app that you're going to need for your device now if you don't want to use the qr code then you can just go to your app store type in levelmate pro and it'll pull up and you can download it from there but you do have a nice quick start guide and once you've downloaded the app then the installation process and setup is something that the app will walk you through and i've also made another video on how to do all that so you get the quick start uh cards here and then in each one of these uh you've got the levelmate pro over here you're gonna have your device that comes in each one of these and uh they are sized a little bit differently so the the levelmate pro here is uh five inches across uh by two inches up and down here and then the width from here to here is about an inch and the levelmate pro plus is still the same five inches across but it's about two and a half inches up and down here and then the width is about an inch and a quarter so a little bit bigger of a module but either way it's not going to matter it's that you know having a little bit bigger device or a smaller device isn't going to affect the installation at all but i did want to point that out they both do have an on and off switch on the bottom and something that you'll notice kind of right out of the gate here is one of the differences in the pro here and the pro plus is that this does have a usb connection uh on it now these units uh come pre-installed with uh batteries and this unit here takes a 2032 the the pro and the pro plus takes a 2354 so it's got a bigger battery and that that bigger battery will get you about three times the life out of that battery but in addition on the pro plus you're going to have a usb power cable that you could just plug this in and uh leave it connected to power and then you don't have to worry about the battery so that's one of the advantages of the pro plus is uh as you get that there now uh in addition both of these units are going to come with a pack of screws because you're going to want to mount this in your rv that you'll see this on our installation video it's going to be a permanent mount so it does come with the screws because because this being stationary is so important during the leveling process you are going to need to use the screws you wouldn't want to velcro it or two sided tape and have this thing kind of moving around because that's going to affect the readings okay so we've got the screws that come with both of these units right and then you're going to have a couple of little glue dots and when you get your unit uh you're gonna need to kind of look around for this because uh it's white and it sits on the bottom of a white box so just kind of scratch around there and you'll see it this is something that is just used in the installation process to test different locations before you hard mount it with the screws you don't have to use it but it's kind of a good idea and you'll see how we use it in our installation video so that is all that comes in the boxes and again we've talked about that the differences in these two first functionally they do the same thing okay so functional wise there there is no difference uh the apps the same um it's gonna level your rv just the same but the pro plus does come with uh that usb charging cable and out of the box the pro plus uh will work with the apple watch app that's the pro plus that will do that the regular pro model out of the box will not work with the apple watch app however you can buy the apple watch app for about 15 bucks for the regular levelmate pro uh model or if you know you're going to use it you can just go and get the pro plus model and it'll just it'll just come out of the box ready to work with the apple watch so these units again they do work with uh android and apple smart devices but as it relates to the watch app it's only apple watch okay so again uh the functionally the same thing with the pro plus you get the ability to out of the box work with the apple uh watch and it's got the uh usb charging connection and uh that is everything that comes in in the levelmate pro and the levelmate pro boxes so there you have it you can get the levelmate pro or the levelmate pro plus at techno technorv.com and you know when you get it from technorv.com that you're always going to get the best support we're complete with our learning series with installation videos and all that good stuff so head on over to technorv.com and check them out", "snippet": {"publishedAt":

the brand levelmate pro for wireless vehicle leveling for your rv you may know a little bit about techno rv's business model and that is that we are full-time rvers and we thoroughly vet and test all products that we sell on our site and the levelmate pro was no exception to that and so the levelmate pro came about actually through some of our customers emailing us and saying hey you might want to check this product out and uh then we sent a survey out to our customers and kind of asked him about it and we got enough information to say hey we should be checking this product out and we're so happy that we did so the next step in the process is that i ordered some level mate pros because i needed to test them and then also i got a phone call with one of the engineers at levelmate pro and i just want to kind of talk through that about how these units work and the uh the quality processes that they go through to make sure that this is a a premium product the first thing that i want to point out is that this product is manufactured in asheville north carolina so you'll be happy to know that you get the made in the usa sticker right on the box here and that's kind of hard to do with an electronic uh piece of equipment these days but levelmate pro believes in that and so we're happy to say that it is made in the usa uh when i was talking to the engineers about how this unit works they explained to me that there's an accelerometer in the level mate devices and these accelerometers measure three in three dimension so it's the x y and z axis so it's your it's your side to side which is your is your roll uh it's your it's your front to back which is your pitch and then it's also got uh up and down also so it measures in all of those different ways now just having the accelerometer and this is where i think other devices may miss the mark you can definitely with those points of data give information about where you're off as it relates to angles but where levelmate pro takes it to another step is during the setup process you take just a few measurements off of your rv and by having all of this information not only can it tell you where you're on level at but it can also tell you how to correct that and that's really where the difference is with the levelmate pro is it can tell you where you're off and how to correct it like if you're off on one side it's going to be like hey you're off like three inches over here and as you start to correct that on the app you'll see it start to come into into correction to get you to perfectly level as it relates to the quality of the product which is very important to us at techno rv to make sure that we're providing a quality product the accelerometers are are temperature sensitive and so what level mate does during their manufacturing process is they take each level mate device and they literally put each one of them into environmental chambers and they basically zero out all three axises of the of the accelerometer and because they're temperature sensitive then they start raising and lower the temperature over a very broad range and then those corrections to bring it back to zero based on what the temperature is is put into a correction table and then that's committed to memory in each individual device and this is where i was kind of amazed in that there's no two level mate pros that have the exact correction table into it because each one of them can be a little bit different as it goes through uh the processes in the environmental chamber the other thing i was amazed about is that you know this is not something that just takes like five minutes and they move on the calibration process uh to raise and lower those temperatures and build those correction tables takes about two and a half hours for each unit now obviously they can do more more than one unit at a time and then once they run it through that and commit that to its memory they do another two and a half hours worth of testing to basically ensure that the correction table that they put in is doing exactly what it's supposed to do so you know when i'm talking to the engineers about that i'm pretty blown away that that their manufacturing process goes into so much detail to make sure that it's that it's completely accurate and this is what you're getting when you get the levelmate pro product you're getting a quality product that has a lot of quality testing built into it and that was one of the things that that uh made us want to sell the levelmate product now of course i've tested this product on many rvs it works flawlessly this is an app-based product so i've done another video to where i unbox kind of what's in there but for the most part you're getting your levelmate device and then you'll have your smart device whether it be a phone or a tablet you'll download the app onto that and then the app will walk you through the installation process of course you get this unit from techno rv you're going to get the techno rv learning series where i've made video and made some written documents about specifically how you set this unit up but it's so easy to uh to set up and i like that too right because uh sort of whatever your skill level it's you're going to be able to operate this device the communication from this device to the app in your cell phone is is bluetooth and uh the the bluetooth that they use has a range of 250 feet uh and that's clear line of sight now obviously you're going to have you know the walls of your rv and different things like that so all that affects things but the point is is that it is bluetooth technology which does very well uh over distance and through objects like your rv so having proper communication because like if you're using this device on like my travel trailer behind me then i'm gonna be sitting in my truck in front of the rv communicating with this that sits in the rv while i do my leveling and so it's very important to have good communication so there there's i've seen another uh competitor on the market that we tested also and uh they use more of a straight rf signal and you know i take the time to go through and read uh you know reviews and things like that and some of the things that i read was communication uh is not great on some of these uh other models and then also that the calibration gets off and and so when i start seeing things like that and i'm making decisions on brands then i want to key in on like hey here's things that can go wrong how does your particular unit handle these situations and with their calibration processes and bluetooth technology again it's just a home run with the uh with the levelmate pro as far as the setup there is once you download the app uh and and turn the unit on they communicate with each other there's a setup wizard and so i wanted to make sure that that was was flawless and it it's literally one of the the best uh apps that i've seen for an electronic uh device because you know i ran through the testing like many many many times and it was just flawless every time like from screen to screen it's uh it articulates exactly what you need to be doing on each screen for the initial setup as far as you know what type of rv do you have you need to enter you need to enter some measurements for your rv and it was just very easy to go through that again we've made a learning series to help walk you through that but honestly uh you're going to be fine just going through the the setup wizard on your own but we like to make it easy on you i did like the fact that they uh have an on and off switch on these models because they are powered by battery so there's really no sense in the unit being on if you're not using it so you can easily turn it on and off when it's not in use to preserve the battery life and then there are two different models um and there's the levelmate pro and the levelmate pro plus and the pro plus that functionally they do the same thing the pro plus has a usb power supply that you can use instead of a battery but if you want to use the battery on the pro plus it actually has a bigger battery than the regular pro model and it's my understanding you get about three times the battery life because it's got a bigger battery on the pro plus model over the regular pro model in addition the other difference between the pro and the pro plus model is the pro plus model uh can work with an apple watch out of the box if you get the regular pro model you can still use it on an apple watch but you do need to download an additional app that costs 15 bucks whereas the pro plus that just kind of comes with it so as it relates to the app apple or android and it's a free download as it relates to the apple watch app free download on the pro plus not a free download on the pro model that's a 15 upgrade on that one but the pro model's less expensive than the pro plus so a little bit of trade off there you can figure that out but uh you know what i've been all through this model done all of our testing and uh i'm really blown away by level mates manufacturing processes and their quality controls and that's the kind of product that we want at techno rv and we could not be more excited to sell the level mate products so go over to technorv.com and check them out", "snippet": {"publishedAt":

{"id": "HlvmNAVqcPQ", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "-FchlhEaG7T_sij2NT-Ur7sRxAs", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and i've got evan from our support department with us because in this video we're going to show you an unboxing of the pepwave product that you just got and we're going to show you all the antennas and sort of how to put that together and i specifically wanted to bring evan in because after we do this video she is then going to do more videos to show you how to do the setup sort of on the back end of this right so what we have here is one of our units and we're just going to demonstrate this on one unit because they're all so similar that you'll get the idea just by going through this one so which one do we have here this is the single modem cat18 that's right all right so let's so let's open it so quick start guide right so in the quick start guide um i think it's always worth going through the manual and there is a way that you can go in and download the full manual from this so read through that but ask you to do something just do it there and then we've got sort of the engine to this thing and this is a single modem unit and then there's also dual modems as well so let's dig in here and look at antennas and then we're going to install the sim card so what kind of antennas do we have here well uh this particular cat 18 unit comes with four cellular antennas they're the smaller paddle shapes do you want to open that up this one's open there we go all right four of those got it all right and two wi-fi antennas here's one that's open for you okay looks a little bit different and it says 2.4 slash 5 gigahertz wi-fi on it now uh if you have the pep wave mini version then it's not going to say the 5 gigahertz on it it'll just say wi-fi on it basically because it's a 2.4 gigahertz model only so these are the slight variations that you might see depending on what model you have so this one has two wi-fi antennas because it does 2.4 and 5 gigahertz all right and what else do we have we have a gps antenna right there okay so the gps antenna comes with it if you choose to use that it's a pretty simple installation onto here and we'll connect it here in just a bit in another video i talk about sort of what this actually does so watch that and then you can make the decision if you actually want to install the gps antenna or not your choice it will work just fine with or without it and then we have the power supply so we have a wall outlet power supply that is pretty simple just plugs into the connector on the back of the unit here and then when you get this from techno rv which obviously you did you'll be really excited to know that we also include the 12 volt cigarette lighter style plug here and then we also include a 10 foot obviously that's not 10 feet but for the purpose of this video we just have a short one here so we don't clutter the table up a fused hardwired cable for 12 volt if you want to hardwire this into a power source so that is everything that you get with your unit oh you get a little bracket here yeah you get a little bracket here so that'll be in there too so that's what you have in your unit so what we need to do now is we just need to assemble all this and the first part of this the best way to do this is to do the sim card right you want to do that first because once you get the antennas on there it is not fun trying to do that after okay so we're gonna do the sim cards it takes a full size sim card and i want to show you an example here this is a sim card that i got from t-mobile and on the side of it it has standard size which would be if you just clipped out the full-size sim card and then it also has it to where you can clip it out as a micro or a nano nano sim card the pep wave units take full size sim cards so if you're taking an existing sim card out of maybe a jet pack or something that you have and it is one of the smaller units then you can get adapters we sell them on techno rv so if you have one of those smaller ones you can always pick that up and then you just pop it in the adapter into the full size unit there anyway that's that so to put the sim card in you're going to need a phillips head screwdriver and then on the back of the unit here or well this would be the front of the unit you're going to see two screws and a little cover here so you're just going to pop the phillips head screws out here there goes that and one more so do it nope almost see how this wouldn't be fun with antennas already on it yeah and then that'll just pop out all right so we have a close-up view here of the sim slots and that is a full-size sim card and let's take our time here because we want to make sure we get this right so you've got two card slots and let's say you've got two cards the slotted side of the sim card goes in first and the chip side of the card is going to go to the center so if you're on the top slot the chip side is going to go down and if you're putting it in the bottom slot then the the chip side goes up like this but slanted side always goes in first and then again the chip side which is this side here is always going to go to this point towards the center so i'm going to go ahead and do these and show you how easy it is so slot first i'm going to turn this to where the chip side is down and then it just slides right in and then you'll feel it click just like that and then if i do another one remember slotted side first and on this one i'm going to do the chip side again to the center which would be up on this one and i need better eyes here there we go and just like that it just goes right in as well so now i want to show you this on a dual modem because this is a single modem so let's get another modem out in case you've got one of our duals so this is for those of you that got a dual modem what you'll have is you will have an a and a b slot here in a one and a two so what you want to make sure here is if you're using say a verizon and a t card you just want to make sure that you put one on the one side one on the two side and make sure it's both of them are on a or technically both of them could be on b2 but for the ease of it i'm just going to put both of these in a and again slanted side in first chip side facing the center and that's just gonna pop in there like that and then again now i'm gonna go well that was two sides so i'll put this one on one side slanted side of the card in first chip side is going to face to the center and we're just going to slide that in there just like that and just like that they are installed all right so one thing i want to point out here is that the the one and the two actually indicates the different modems so it's important that if you've got two carriers and you want to use both the motors at the same time that you put them one in on the one side one on the two side if you were to not do that and you were to put both of your carriers on say just the one side then it would not be able to utilize those resources at the same time and it kind of defeats the purpose of it so make sure you put one on the one side and one on the two side so the sim cards are installed and off camera uh evan went ahead and put back on the cover to the sim cards so that's now make sure you do that and i'm going to turn it over to evan and let her put these antennas on it and then we're just about done with this part of the process yeah perfect so uh this particular cat 18 modem does come with a gps antenna two wi-fi antennas and four cellular antennas you may have a different situation depending on your model and we're also going to point out that the names of these ports on here can be different depending on which model you have as well so we're just going to take this as a process of elimination starting with the one that we know is really easy and that's gps it's right there clearly labeled gps and that's this antenna here we're not going to install this one today your router will work perfectly fine with or without that so we're just going to set that one aside next i know that we have these two wi-fi antennas they both say 2.4 and 5 gigahertz now we get into those details in some other learning materials but the point of this right here is that it doesn't matter there's not a 2.4 port and a 5 gigahertz port just put these both in the wi-fi ports and those are right here so we're going to go ahead and do that so either one i can put you're putting that there but you could actually put it in the other one and be fine okay that makes sense and next we'll get to cellular so we know that the gps one right there is covered right so the only four left are cellular uh these are labeled main 1a main 1b aux 1a and so on so they don't say cellular which was why this was a good way to install these so go ahead and put all four on there and some of the other models uh to evan's point they may say uh the word specifically cellular on them and uh but you'll just know that these are the cellular antennas for your unit and that's the ports that go in it it'll be real easy for you to see once you see it it'll it'll all make sense and so that is i'll let her continue to do this and i'll just kind of wrap this up here so once all of your antennas are installed then it is just a matter of giving it power and for the sake of ease here i'll just take the wall outlet over here and we will just uh plug that into the where it says uh this one says 12 volt 48 volts yours may say something different to that but it will say dc so if i was using a wall outlet i would just plug this into here plug it into a wall outlet this part of the process is done so in the upcoming learning series video i'm really just turning this completely over to evan and she is going to walk you through the rest of the setup and kind of get into the details of a lot of other capabilities that the pep waves uh have i do encourage everybody to just kind of take it slow take one piece at a time go through the learning series very thoroughly and if you uh have any questions about anything along the way you can chat with us at technorv.com monday through friday you can email us at info technorv.com anytime and monday through friday if you just want to chat uh with evan or somebody else in our support department about something then you can just give us a call so that's it that's the setup yeah", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2021-09-16T20:35:48Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "TechnoRV Learning

{"id": "19WsSDyfwOw", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "jIsVr8jqBZarnZXfylOAFPKqB-w", "transcript": "hey it's eric from techno rv and we have been selling the garmin rv gps's for many years now and today i've got karen with me from garmin and if you are interested in a garmin rv gps you're probably going to want to watch this whole video because we're going to answer a lot of questions that we typically get on this welcome thank you so much so i say we jump right in okay and just start hammering out the different aspects of these gps's so i guess where i want to start we'll just kind of talk back and forth here about this um because i've got a lot of experience using these and then you've got the kind of the garmin side of it uh but what what makes a rv specific gps unique well that's a great question so it's specific they're specific to the needs of people who are driving rvs you're not like your typical person in a car going down the road so when someone is considering buying garmin navigation for rvs really what you're buying you're getting peace of mind you're getting layers of resources all in one unit instead of having an atlas and different websites and so forth all these resources are rolled up into one thing but when i say peace of mind somebody who's traveling with an rv or they're camping every rig is different people are telling cars they're towing campers they have a class a a motorhome the peace of mind comes from having a navigation unit that allows you to create a profile for what it is that you're driving down the road exactly what the configuration is that could be the height the width of the weight are you carrying propane and then it takes all the guesswork out it's now going to deliver a route to you based on that so there are no surprises so that's the number one thing because it's not as you know like driving your car you have different needs there's different things you need to take into consideration and garmin takes that right off your mind we take care of that when i started rving and then and i started out in this big class hey i mean it's 40 feet tall it's or it's 40 feet long it's 13 feet tall sure and and literally the number one thing that i was concerned about was i don't want to be on a road come around a corner and there'll be a low bridge that's like like 10 feet and i i was a bit fearful of that and i was like i got to resolve this and then that's when i started using rv gps's and we've been to 49 states uh with our garmin unit uh and as people know the travel up in the northeast there's just a lot of issues up there with low bridges and things like that and it is always it just takes it out it doesn't people ask me does it alarm you of something up ahead that's a low bridge and i say no because it's not even going to route you on that road in the first place so i've had a great experience uh with it because of that what about um like everything else built in like the points of interest that are specific to rvs yeah well you know back to that first point like you you have this rig whatever that looks like you've got a lot on your mind you're managing that and you stay at the low bridge you're not going to back up right you need to have a custom route well also keeping it simple right we know what our viewers are expecting or what what they need to know they want to know where campgrounds are they want to know places to stay these are all apps that are built right into your navigation device so instead of having separate resources in your motorhome or your car that's towing something you've got it all right at your fingertips um it could be planning where am i going to spend the night i want to look at campgrounds i want to sort by amenities to see if they have what i want but even a trip advisor is an example of an app that would be on one of these units and you're able to look at ratings like you know do i want a two-star rating do i want a four-star rating uh foursquare is another one there's just so many resources so you're not juggling with your cell phone um different websites trying to have pages load it's all hard loaded right into this device and so you're just sitting here in a cockpit as you will just with your hands able to have all the resources together and and i've also got a small travel trailer and and so you know my height and things like that aren't really a concern in most areas of the country but those points of interest i use all the time in fact i i pretty much navigate specifically by those points of interest because i'm usually going to like an rv park or uh you know a truck stop or some some gas station i'm usually going somewhere that's already built into this so most of the time i don't even have to enter an address i just go find the point of interest hit it and say go and you know we were talking about amenities and things that you you definitely have to have fuel and food and lodging but let's not forget like another app that's building is a history channel because that's kind of why you're going on vacation you want to know what's nearby what am i what can i possibly see you'll get a small picture you'll get a description and then you'll get information like okay here you are at this national park like here the entrance is it's just all the resources resources that you would need are right there yes and and i love it so uh with that said let's kind of start breaking down some of the the different elements and questions that we get get asked okay and and and so these are straight from customers far away all right and so uh the first one uh concern is do i have to have cell service in order to get uh navigated on my garmin gps okay and that is such a great question because the whole point of getting gps driven navigation is because you can't count on cell service and typically when you're on vacation you're going far and beyond places you've never been before you don't know where those gaps are but they're everywhere particularly if you're going to go out west right so you might be navigating with a phone or something cell service is gone there's your navigation it's gone and it's always in the worst times too right because you don't know where you are right so that's i think piece of when i mentioned earlier peace of mind that's like the biggest thing because a garmin navigation unit all of these maps all these resources we talked about are built in it's like a date these databases that you operate like an app super simple um but gps as long as you have sky the satellites are there there are no gaps you know if you're on the globe and you're outside and there's sky you're not going to lose your bearings and then and i love that yeah i love it too i mean i use it i don't have a raid i have a car but i lose cell service right so i'd like to have it uh all right we're gonna keep hammering away at her people uh so so what about this uh traffic i'm driving and there's a traffic jam up ahead or something does does this unit tell me that and maybe give me some options around it yeah and you even have options i mean some come with a traffic cable where where the cable itself is is actually getting that traffic feedback but you always have the option of pairing your navigation unit to your phone and you're getting live traffic you're getting live fuel prices but that traffic situation i've used it with my garmin car navigation it's fantastic because you'll get a notification that says there's a traffic jam ahead we estimate that if you stick on this route it's going to take you one hour we suggest this route and it'll give you the time so you can compare it and it can be it could save you like 20 minutes it could save you 40 minutes so it's wonderful and then you just touch no i want to say what i'm doing or yeah i'll take that that better route around it and on the rv gps if it does give you a route around that it does still take into consideration your height because you put that into your unit absolutely yeah so that's the whole thing right because you maybe you did do all that work that gets thrown out the window and you have to take a detour right you're like i didn't plan this route i wonder if there's any tunnels i wonder if my propane can go in it don't worry about it yeah this will take care of it if it says you can go there you can do it now i will say this uh if you choose to get off of what garmin is telling you to do like it's saying hey go here and you're like i'm not doing that i want to go this way uh then it will let you know that hey you're potentially on a route that is is not safe for your your rv so the the goal here is just stick with what garmin's telling you to do and you're all good i would i would agree with that yes i would agree with that and then you know sometimes you do have to make a change and of course it's going to reroute you like it you know you never have to back up because you missed that turn yeah right you just keep moving forward garmin's going to get you back where you need to be rv don't like to back up i can't imagine how our viewers do back up they they don't like it no i'm just gonna say i'm just telling you okay uh let's talk about power in this unit so um do you know does it need to be plugged in all the time it does yeah okay so so uh because we get asked this question sometime it does have a battery built into it but that is not designed for your daily navigation power because you're not going to get that long out of that no it's just it's designed to use the 12 volt in your car and you're giving it constant power that's what's powering that large beautiful bright screen and of course we have different size screens depending on how big is the real estate of your windshield how good are your eyes like how big do you need that information to be yeah that requires 12 volt power for sure and so the battery power is like uh some of these units have like a magnetic mount and when i pull it off the magnetic mount it's not being powered by that magnetic mount but that would be for somebody who maybe just wants to make some quick changes there's plenty of battery for that and then you pop it back on the magnetic mount and it's just charging sure because you have a situation where like if you're driving your rv you know you've got your hand on the steering wheel you're the person who's going to be like touching it like this but many people have a co-pilot right and so when you have a co-pilot quite often it's more comfortable for them oh i'm going to change directions i'm just going to pull this down and i have it right here like a tablet yes so of course you know the battery is going to going to work for that but for long term after you do your work you're going to want to just put it right back on that mount and the magnetic mount that you mentioned so convenient right because the magnets just kind of pull it and it's automatically seated it's just super simple keep it plugged in please keep it all right so a lot of people want voice activation and and so talk to me about that people who want voice activation you can have it speaking the directions letting you know when turns come up i'm one of these people uh i i don't like that i like just kind of falling with my eyes you can you know turn that you can i turn the volume to zero yeah but if you like the navigation and you you can even say things to it like okay garmin take me to starbucks okay garmin you you can talk to it that's like an activation cue for some of our units and it'll just completely re-navigate where you're going based on your voice command rather than you actually having to type in an address or a point of interest it's pretty cool and it is cool and and just based on my own experience i have used uh other models in the past and and the voice activation from me to it was just not good so whenever i started using garmin i was wondering is this is this going to work or is this just a marketing thing to say we got it and i am happy to say that like i can literally i can uh say where's the next rest area where's the next truck stop i mean the normal things that i would be looking for i could just say hey garmin where's the next rest area and it'll just line them up on the screen and then and then at a quick glance i can say give me number two and then it'll just take me there like that's so nice when you're on the fly because like we all plan our trips but all of a sudden the needle's hovering their e or somebody's screaming because they're hungry you don't have time when you're driving to totally you know figure out all that just okay garmin or at you know what what's ahead yeah and to to have that right on the fly what's ahead have it lined up i want to go to number two that's so you can manually do it you can speak to it you're you're okay and you can even see it on the screen you can you can program it so you're seeing what's ahead of the next exit you have so many options eric it depends on what you want like you like to talk to it see for you that works really well for me i don't want anybody talking to you i'm driving so i like to just you know touch it and know what's coming up at this exit whatever it is however you want to handle it it's going to let you handle it yeah yeah um okay the next one i want to talk about and if it's all right with you i want to take this one myself because i get so excited about this all right then you take it are you sure all right i'm excited to hear it okay so it's it's route shaping nice and so what happens is um is that i put a route in so we'll have customers that'll put a route in but they may be kind of familiar with the area and and they may be like well i don't want to i don't want to go this route that garmin just gave me or i just want to avoid this turn here or something so you can go into a feature called route shaping and you can literally uh just touch the screen and say you know i want to go here and it'll re it'll reconfigure and it'll just pop over where you just did it so you're basically clicking the screen and dragging uh where you want it you can um avoid entire areas if you want to um so uh you know like i mean i guess you could avoid an entire state if you want to like if you had a warrant after your arrest not me all right but you can definitely go in and do this route shaping thing and it's so easy and and the customers love it because we hear about it and i love it too as an rver because if i'm in an area that i am familiar with i can easily just you know because there may be 10 different ways you can get from point a to point b garmin's going to give you the one that thinks is best if i want to adjust it a little bit i can do it i think route shaping is really cool it allows you even more flexibility and i'm just going to interject and say even without route shaping again what makes rv navigation so unique you will get an alert on your garmin if there is even on the route the garment is made for you maybe there's a sharp curve coming up maybe there's a steep incline just so you have you have time to react to that so i just wanted to add that in there because these units really do have your back they know what you as an rv navigator need to know yeah and especially for like this the steep declines like if you're in a uh you know out west i mean i've been on 10 uh grades and having the knowledge ahead of time that i'm going to come up on that i know i need to go ahead and slow down before i even hit that because you know you've got braking issues and things like that that you need to consider so um okay let's jump into um there's there's three different models that that i want to talk about it's the 780 the 890 and the 1090. can you just real quickly just kind of go through those and kind of talk about like the little differences between those yeah well you're certainly you're not going to be missing anything critical with any it's not like well when i you know go up i get more databases not at all you're going to have similar features i think the driver is what size screen do you need because somebody's in a class a you know a huge motor home versus somebody who's maybe in their truck and they're towing their pickup truck and they're towing something how much real estate do you have available to you and how big do you want that screen to be yeah so those numbers that you quoted the very first number references the diagonal size of the screen so that the 780 is going to be seven inches the 890 is going to be eight and the 1090 is really large it's it's 10 inches it's a beautiful screen maybe it's not so appropriate for a car right you know so i would that's the number one thing that i would tell people you're not really searching for more or less features um i will say the 890 and the 1090 have that really cool magnetic mount yes that we were talking about and i think the magnetic mount is just so nice because you know you're going down the road it doesn't require so much finagling you just put it up there the bag sucks it on and it says very strong bond that's that's a nice kind of cut to those two units and when i look at these units too it's like you know i mean you can go buy a smartphone and it's like it looks like the same phone and it ranges from here to here but there you know that you might have some resolution differences in the screen brilliance uh because it could have a a bit of a stronger battery and and so and that's charities as well yeah and so when i look at that the 890 and the 1090 those are pretty much a mirror of each other with the exception that one's an eight inch and one to ten inch screen right they're both the newest models so they are the best resolution they are that glass edge to edge they're just beautiful units for sure but if i'm like well i don't want an even 10 inch screen and then and i want the 780 that unit has all of the navigational functions that you can get with any of them yeah and you know the resolution is absolutely fine on those it's a seven inch unit yes you have to increase the resolution when you're increasing the size so greatly yeah yeah okay uh so one of the reasons that that techno rv has always uh loved garmin outside of just the products is is support and we as a company uh as most people know that if purchased from us before we try to always make sure people have a great customer experience so we try to take a lot of the level one type questions and help customers sometimes we need a little help so talk to me about your support yeah well you guys are great at that you guys really are the experts and i just will add that you give us a lot of feedback as well because you've got such a huge customer base and we love that i know you do a lot of troubleshooting but i'm on your own but garmin does have wonderful support and that's one of the things that defines garmin as opposed to other brands so customer support when somebody 800 800 1020 person calls up yes you are going to have to press a couple buttons but that's because your call is going to be routed to automotive and then to specifically rv automotive so when the person picks up in kansas that is somebody who they work with rv questions and that one-on-one most times that's all that's needed i mean these are electronics and people have questions if they've not had one before um it's helpful to be able to to have a conversation with somebody and garmin is really excellent about that we're gonna answer the phone if lines were incredibly busy you have the option of just punching in your number and garmin calls you back it is not a nightmare to call garmin it's very easy it's very helpful yeah and when we start when we were back in the day we were considering uh carrying garmin we uh i actually called into the the support line myself just to test it out and and i really came up with these these kind of what i would consider harder questions and they were great and then i actually started talking to the person about what kind of training they get and i could probably thought why am i asking this but but the the training that that they get is is from what i understand just through talking to this person and the knowledge and the experience that i have with them is very intense and very detailed so if you need a question answered we can help you if we can't help you then we'll get garmin to help yeah well product support is a really important part of garmin and so of course they're trained and they're really highly valued because that's part of our brand yeah so i don't think customers are disappointed when they call products more yeah i agree with that all right uh one more thing and i'm gonna close with something um uh updating your garmin we do get asked this uh hey do you do you know do you update it can is it free how long does it last all that good stuff sure the maps that we do we always do map updates because maps change the roads change so these units are built with wi-fi in them so when you get your unit and you take it out of the box you're going to be prompted to add your home wi-fi network you could have any network you want but for me with my electronics it's always my home network so when my unit is in my house it's going to receive that all wirelessly okay yeah and ah free free and like free yeah yeah free okay good all right um so that that covers it on the update so uh i wanted to to close first of all i just didn't want to miss the opportunity with karen coming by the technical rv office to sit down and really i wanted to position this in a way that that it was uh the basics of what somebody would probably want to know if they were considering a garmin unit i want to add one more thing to it just at techno rv.com a lot of people know this that we have created a lot of videos um on how to use these units it's called the technology learning series it's something that when somebody buys one of these units we automatically email it to them so that they can go ahead and just if they just go through those videos they'll know a lot of the basic functions so we get them up to speed real quick so that they can have a successful experience with it we think it's super how you do that you guys are amazing to your customers i mean it's it is it is an amazing experience i mean i've seen your q and a's i've read your newsletters and the learning series is fantastic thank you well thank you for coming on and thanks for having me i you know i saw one of the videos and i really wanted to see the office yeah this is quite a setup it's really impressive i hope you all learned something and uh we'll see you down the road", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2021-08-19T21:06:02Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "Garmin RV GPS FAQs answered by TechnoRV and Garmin", "description":

{"id": "RJe90RLm5Ws", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "lPeQwj2jjaNZEFeh3yHT0BRD7f0", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and i have made detailed videos on almost all of the products that we sell and it occurred to me that i have never made just short videos on each one of them just briefly going over what the product is and what it does so tammy challenged me to line up all of our products on our conveyor belt in our warehouse here and give me two minutes or less per product kind of like a speed round and go through it and just explain each one of them so that is what we are about to do and it starts right now in three two one we boost cellular booster so uh you're out camping you have poor cell signal you want to boost that signal strength the cell signal strength from the cell tower to you and a cell booster is a great way to do it weboost is the industry standard and basically what this does is in this kit you have an outside antenna that brings in the cellular signal the weak cellular signal from the local cell tower it runs it through this amplifier right here it boosts it from the amplifier and then you'll have an inside antenna that sits in your rv and that re-broadcasts that boosted zone and as long as your devices are in that boosted zone then it's going to be boosted now the size of that boosted zone can vary and it really is dependent on what that originating signal strength is so if you have a really weak cell signal then the boosted zone uh will be smaller think speaking through like a megaphone if you whisper in it doesn't do much the louder you speak the more it projects right so kind of the same way with this if you're starting off with a weak signal then it's going to not create a bigger a big zone it might be like a foot or two but if it's if you've kind of got a good signal outside then it's going to project further maybe you'll get 8 to 10 feet out of it as long as your devices are in that boosted zone you're good to go a lot of times people use hot spots and they'll just place that hot spot next to the inside antenna here the hot spot you know is getting boosted and uh and then you can just connect all of your devices to that this kit comes with everything that you need in it the antenna the amplifier the inside antenna the cabling whatever you need it's in here again it's weboost it's the industry standard and that does it that's how it works for cell boosters in under 10 minutes two minutes all right the next product tire pressure monitoring systems that's not running tire pressure monitoring systems uh tires everything's everything's riding on them and the number one thing that any any tire expert will tell you that you can do for your tires is make sure they're running at proper psi to properly do that you need to have your rv weighed preferably at each tire position and then apply those weights to the load inflation chart for your tires manufacturer and then that'll that'll just tell you what psi you should be running once you know what your psi is then it's just a matter of making sure you keep it at that psi tire pressure monitoring systems are great for that we have tst and tire minder at techno rv and basically what this is is you'll have a small sensor that screws onto each valve stem on your vehicle and then you'll have a monitor that sits up in your vehicle with you these sensors broadcast forward your temperature and your uh your pressure of each tire position and so basically what this means is is that if you were to have a condition you would be alarmed typically what will happen is maybe you pick up a nail and your pressure starts to go down you don't know it and as your pressure goes down on your tire your temperature goes up when the tire hits 200 degrees or maybe a little north of 200 degrees the compounds in the tire start to break down that's when you have a tire blowout so i can't stress it enough having a tire pressure monitoring system to know if you're in a situation to where that's happened in most cases it will prevent a tire blow out and so just by having these these devices i'm not going to get into the specifics of each one of them both of them are great i personally use the the tst system but lots of happy tire minder users out there as well and so uh anyway tire pressure monitoring super important and that is is how they work in two minutes or less okay this is the vision works rear observation cameras and so basically you want great field of vision around your rv as you're traveling uh down the road and one critical piece of this is to have a good rear observation system so there's a lot of them on the market and visionworks is the one that we chose for a lot of reasons one it's got a three year warranty over one year warranty that competitors have it's got a better durability rating the clarity on the monitor is just unbelievable they use a sony camera so no cheap stuff i'm talking about metal casing cameras and basically these units come in a five inch monitor a seven inch monitor and a nine inch monitor and so and the other cool thing about these is that uh if you have a rv that maybe has a pre-wired like furion mount on it or a pre-wired voyager mount these systems will work with that because uh when you place an order you just say hey i've got the pre-wire fury on mount and then we would send you basically uh the the adapter for that particular mount so um the install is is really easy on these things they just take 12 volt power it is all wireless so once you get power to that camera you don't have a hard wire running up forward to your monitor where you sit the static static range on these things is a thousand feet of course you're never going to get a thousand feet because that's not the real world for us you've got your rv in between you and who knows what else but uh basically uh the fact that the the static range is even a thousand feet is pretty amazing but uh getting through i've tested it on my 41 foot motor home i put the camera on the back of my jeep so i mean we're probably 50 60 feet or something like that signal came through good so anyway it's vision works it is an excellent system great clarity easy to install and there you go vision works okay the next product up is a soft start device and basically what a soft start device is these are for your ac units so your ac unit whenever you turn your ac unit on uh it it spikes the amperage in order to start the air conditioner right and then after that spike which is is uh basically like a six of a second um it basically comes back down to what its running level is and so that spike can oftentimes be a problem if you are say uh in a 30 amp rv and you want to run your your rv on say a 2000 watt generator a 2200 watt generator that amperage spike can often trip those generators so if you install a soft start onto your air conditioner unit on a 30 amp model then basically what it does is it levels out that spike so that it basically is is just not there i mean it might take your spike from like 60 amps down to like 24 or 25 amps or somewhere around there basically the way it does this is uh if if it you know took this much time to start it without the the uh the soft start which whatever time that is less than a second it might take double that but it's still less than a second you would never even know the difference and so basically by just increasing that startup by a fraction of a second it can level out that amperage now if you have a 50 amp rig and you're on a 30 amp pedestal you know you can't run two ac units but if you put a soft start on each ac unit by eliminating that spike now as a 50 amp rv i can run two air conditioners on a 30 amp pedestal and the install is easy the brand soft start and it's a great product ah one of my favorites uh surge guard electrical protection system so i've got two of them here one of them is 50 amp if you're in a 50 amp rig one of them's 30 amp if you're in a 30 amp rig so let's just get that out of the way uh you always need to match this to whatever your rv is if you're in a 30 amp rig get this one if you're in a 50 amp rig get this one and then adapt from there so these like if i'm in a 50 amp rv and i'm using this one but i only have a 30 amp pedestal then just use a 30 amp female to a 50 amp i'm sorry a 30 amp male to a 50 amp female adapter and this will uh work just fine and then you can adapt this one up if there was only 50 amp so what do these things do so uh there's a lot of things that can go wrong with a pedestal when you plug these in and turn the breaker on it runs a 10 second analysis it's making sure there's a ground a neutral and there's no reverse polarity issues if there is one of these issues on its initial inspection then it won't pass the power through to you and it'll tell you on this uh on the front of this unit right here what the fault is but let's say everything is fine it clicks passes the power off to you and then what it's doing from there it's protecting you against surges and also high and low voltage high and low voltage anything from 102 volts up to 132 volts if you get outside of that range and these are these are ranges set by the national electrical code to sit in something that we just came up with if you get outside of that range which is considered high and low voltage this will cut you off from it because for example low voltage that's just not safe for the electronic components in your rv you don't want to be running on low voltage this will cut you off if it does cut you off it will run an analysis and when things come back up to spec it'll cut you back on so if you're out for dinner you come back your power had gone off it's just going to cut it right back on for you this one also has load side protection it can detect elevated ground currents and open neutral conditions inside of your rv and my two minutes are up these things are great if you need more detail go look at my video where i did a detailed video sorry danny can you roll these up for me uh okay so pep wave there is no way i'm getting through all this in two minutes i have made detailed videos on everything it says pepwave is a cellular router so you provide your own sim card with your own data plan on it and it goes into a pepwave cellular router this has been a game changer for us out on the road they come in single modem and dual modem uh versions the dual dual modem you can actually be running two different carriers at one time and when you're doing this it can do something called bonding and basically it can take both of those carriers and sort of bond them together and then represent it to you as a a better experience if you get a single modem unit then you can still put two carriers in it but it'll only run uh one at a time and so you can manually go back and forth so if you've got say an att and a t-mobile and in a particular area t-mobile is better than att well then you can just manually swap it over to the uh to the t-mobile uh version there so uh there's uh there's many different uh category levels the higher the category level means the higher the theoretical speed so we have cat sixes cat 12 and cat 18s and then we've got single modems and dual modems also so you know for us it just means that when we have our carriers built into the unit we know that that's just being managed properly it's always going to have me where i need to be to get the best experience out of it there is so much more to the pep wave i'm running out of my two minutes here and i don't want to just ramble on it because i don't have time to do it anyway go check out my comparison video on all of the pep wave units and the features video on the pep wave units and that will get you all the details that you need next up garmin uh rv gps's so you're in an rv uh my rv's over 13 feet tall a lot of the fifth wheels are um even travel trailers can be tall you've got your your your width your length how many propane tanks you have all of these things should be taken into consideration on how you're routed to go down the road when i started rv and it was one of the things that i was worried about the most is this big rv like i don't want to turn down a road and have like a low bridge that i can't go under so garmin has these rv gps's there's many models of them and they all have specific different features in the unit and you'll just have to go to the product page and check out what those are but here's what it is when you get one of these units the navigation is all the same no matter what unit you get you're going to enter your height your weight how many propane tanks you have and then it's going to route you according to that so immediately uh it's it turns into kind of stress-free at that point because you know that this is going not going to route you down a road that you're not designed to be on especially those those low bridges because we've hear these stories from um rvers that this happens to them and this is the answer for them they come in seven uh eight and 10 inch screens so if you like a bigger screen uh you get the 10 inch seven is fine uh or or the the uh the eight uh also there are tons of rving points of interest with these rv gps's all of your campgrounds uh all of your travel centers all those fuel stops there's a lot of creative ways that you can make multi-stop trips to where before your trip gets started you can just go and just chart out hey where i want to go and then just save that trip in this unit so all these things even if you're in a smaller rv all of these points of interest and different things like that can be a great help so it's the garmin rv gps via air is next up these are tire inflators there are four models let me go through that real quick this is the 89 right here this is designed for class b's the 300 is designed for smaller towables the 400 is designed for larger towables and class cs and then the 450 model is designed for class a's these are very well built units and a lot of rvers love these things and i love mine too so basically what you've got is you've got a unit that operates off 12 volt power so you're going to have two clips that you're going to pop straight to a battery so if you're out in the middle of nowhere and you don't have power and all you have to depend on is your dc power you're still going to be able to air up your tires and that is a a big feature of the vayers to be able to do that you can connect it to your truck batteries if you do that you need to make sure the truck is turned on to keep the amperage level level up on the batteries or you can plug plug it directly to your rving batteries in which case your rv needs to be plugged into shore power again to keep that amperage level built up so uh talking specifically about the 400 model and the 450 model those come with a few extra little features they come with a gas station style air gun and a 40 inch extended chuck that you can attach to that air gun that allows you to connect to your valve stem and air up while you're standing up to save save the knees uh of just having to be down there uh with your tight tire um they've all got like a tips kit to air up different little things so and they're very very powerful i'm talking about the 400 450 models are up to 150 psi for those bigger tires and then of course the 89 and the 300 are more appropriate for those size tires for those rvs fire they are spectacular okay this is the smart plug and basically if you're in like a towable and you and you you go to connect your power up to your towable typically they'll have like a twist lock style plug and the pins are curved and you you stick it in there and turn it and then you've got a little collar that you'll twist that design is a very old design and smart plug just came up with a better one so there's a couple of things that are uh not great about that old design first of all just putting the plug in there twisting it and trying to get that little plastic collar lined up and not cross threading it if you've used one of these you absolutely know what i'm talking about um it can be a little bit of an issue whenever you're connecting also those curved pins they don't offer um the i'm not going to say not enough surface space to get the job done but the surface space and what i mean by that is that when the pins come together right so uh smart plug thought hey we're gonna we're just gonna make a better unit so basically what this is is you would replace your inlet so no more twist lock plugs and you would replace the head on your power cord to match up with the inlet or you can get an inlet and then just buy an entire cord with the smart plug head already attached to it it's a completely just snap in place type unit you push it you hear a snap and it's in there no no issues the other thing is is they've made the electrical pins much thicker and wider for the plug and it provides for better electrical transfer reduces the heat on that plug there's been plenty of tests run between the with the difference between smart plug and one of those other style plugs the heat is reduced whenever you use a smart plug and you have better electrical transfer because of those thicker pins install is easy you can do it that smart plug it's a great upgrade for your rv next up is the gas stop automatic propane shut off so on your existing propane tank you've got a couple of safety devices neither one of which can provide 100 percent automatic shut off to your propane tank should you have a cut line or something like that so what you have is you have something called a opd that's an overfill protection device that was they put these on these propane devices like back in 1998 it's good keeps you from overfilling your tank and it's also the device that keeps you from when there's not a connection on that tank and you just open it uh it does not free flow which that's great right uh back in the day you could turn that and it would just free flow so opd excellent device beyond that um the the part that you screw on to the tank from your line has something in it that uh there's basically like a spree spring-loaded device in there it's called an excess flow valve if you were to have a large leak it would cut off somewhere around 80 percent of that leak that's what that excess flow valve is that's great but it still leaves that 20 percent incomes gas stop this device connects right to your propane tank and then you just connect your line directly to this and if you have a a line cut or a line rupture or anything like that it's going to instantly and automatically cut your propane off to your rv there's also something called gas gear and it's basically replaces your line from your propane tank to the gas stop it's not required but it does have a 90 degree turn here and sometimes that makes it easier to have in case you've got one of those cases that goes on over your propane tanks and if you sometimes if you don't have this that case won't go over once you add this length to it so that is the gas stop device one more people wi-fi boosting you're in an rv park and you want to connect to the rv's wi-fi access point which most of them have there's two issues you can have with this one of them you can resolve and one of them you can't one is a signal issue a lot of times you're you know 150 yards away from the access point and that little wi-fi adapter in your phone or your tablet or your computer it's really not designed to reach out that far and grab a signal and so uh signal can be an issue the other issue is bandwidth that's how much basically internet that particular rv park provides for you to um to be online so if they've got uh if they've appropriated enough bandwidth for say 50 rvers and they got 100 people in the park then that's going to slow the pipeline down and everybody's probably not going to have a great experience that's the one you can't do anything about that's on the park but this issue of signal from you to the access point you can absolutely do something about that and you do that with something called a wi-fi booster this is the cam pro kit super popular and basically what it is is you have an outside antenna that goes and picks up that weak signal from that access point it brings it into your rv where you will have a signal repeater and basically this just creates your own hot spot within your rv now from and they can be password protected they're totally encrypted now from my device instead of me trying to connect 150 yards away i just got to connect like five feet away in my own rv where this repeater is and the outside antenna is what did the job to get the signal in so it's a stronger transmitter a stronger antenna and they are spectacular a lot of people use them and they will definitely resolve the issue with uh low signal strength in an rv park and that does it people that is all of our major products tammy's behind the camera how did i do well done all right two minutes two minutes or less on all of it and uh i'm happy to do it because i like talking about all this stuff again i just want to re-emphasize uh this was just meant for some people just want a quick rundown of sort of what we got what it does what the problem is and how this resolves it that's what you got today if you want more details about each one of these products i've got videos on these that really go into details about all of this so i don't want to bypass those if you want more on an individual product just go over there and do that this is eric technorv and we will see you down the road", "snippet": {"publishedAt":

{"id": "JoDB3pW8Jhc", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "H6FUmg_xIsl-84KePtX6TDpFxcA", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and this is my forest river rockwood mini light and in this video i'm going to install the gas stop devices on this unit i've got two 30 pound propane tanks here and sometimes you can run into a bit of a unique situation whenever you've got like a tight cover on this so i want to walk through what your options are so that these will fit within this covering so the first step of course is we need to take the cover off and then i'll show you kind of what we're talking about here so we'll work with this one first here so if you think about it whenever you put a gas stop on here it's just going to screw directly onto the propane tank first the first problem that i've run into here is is a uh my propane hose just didn't long enough to come around here and do this so uh in addition even if it was long enough this extra length right here is going to get into the side of that casing so a couple of things you can do here one is you can loosen this up here to where you can turn these tanks to where maybe you can turn it to where your gas stop isn't facing the side maybe it's facing like over here to give you a little bit more room in my case that's not going to work either and so gas stop has come out with something called gas gear and it's basically a very high quality propane hose with a 90 degree turn on it and if you just look at it you can just tell from a quality standpoint truth the matter is i'd rather just have this anyway so whether you're doing a gas stop or not you cannot you maybe should consider just getting a higher quality uh propane hose and this gas gear is certainly the answer for that so uh i'm going to go ahead and and start digging into the install here and letting you know the things that you need to consider along the way okay so what we're going to do here is we're going to disconnect this hose right here from the regulator right here and this is a quarter inch inverted male connection here and so is this so i'm not going to have any any problems here and in fact most propane tanks you'll find are a quarter inch inverted male and but if if you'll notice right here whenever i unscrew this propane line right here i'm unscrewing it at this point this part stays in which in effect is basically is basically an adapter it's basically a quarter inch male to a quarter inch female inverted flare here mine comes with that and most propane tanks do but if you are looking to install this and see that uh that you don't have that adapter then you can get one of these from techno rv and it's basically your uh your converter from here to where you can screw right into it so that makes that easy all right so uh step one of course make sure your your propane tanks are turned off which mine are and and then i'm just going to take a little wrench and i'm just going to go ahead and and remove this propane hose right here sometimes these can be a little tight on there and uh and this crescent wrench should do the job okay there it goes all right that was that was easy uh they may not all be that easy and then i'm just gonna basically unscrew this from there so we're done there the other thing i'm gonna do is i'm going to go ahead and loosen this here and this will this will give me a little bit of room to work with here i am going to go ahead and disconnect this other side as well and that will give me a little bit more room to work with as well okay now something to consider uh whenever you get these gas gears they they come in two links they they come in uh 12 inch and and then they come in 18 inches so i'm going to kind of show you the difference here and then hopefully that'll kind of give you an idea of of which one you may need i think i'm going to end up using the 18 inch but uh once we get into this uh we shall see so uh the next step is is we just need to install this so this is just a matter of getting it started and then tightening it down okay that's on there good and tight and then the next step after that is to go ahead and put your gas stop device on onto your tank here so this just threads right on just like your propane hose would have threaded on okay and then from here it's it's just trying to figure out how do you want to route this you know i mean because the hose can go a lot of different ways uh but you can see how much further this sticks out than just going directly into the propane tank here and uh and how if you didn't have this this 90 degree here how that could be a problem with the side of the uh the case and so you can kind of fool around with this and see what's best for you and uh i'm just kind of playing around with it here i think that this right here is probably going to be my best bet you never want to grab onto this right here whenever you're tightening it make sure you just grab the base of the gas stop that could break off if you put too much put too much pressure on that so i mean that's basically the install so i want to show you now how i can now put the casing on of course i'll do the install on the other side but it'll be the same thing as this one so i won't waste your time with that on the other side uh so let's let's back the shot up a little bit and then i'll show you how this casing fits right on here now so the first thing i want to do is show you the difference in having this this 90 degree here not to mention just the quality is better than you know this thing but uh but you can see the difference here like if i didn't have that 90 degree i mean having this turn in i mean i'm gaining myself i don't know two three inches here of uh that i need in order to put put the the casing back on so not to mention that if i you know you really don't want to bend these these uh propane lines like that in the first place so anyway grab the case and just like that the case fits otherwise without the 90 degree turn that would not fit all right so i've got both of them installed here so you can kind of see what that looks like and uh i've inspected for leaks everything's good and so uh in order to to use your gas stop it's really easy you just you turn your your propane on and then you're going to pump this gauge three or four times and whenever whenever you pump it a few times you'll see the gauge move up to whatever the level of your propane is and you'll you'll almost feel uh the propane engage into the lines here so i'm going to go ahead and pump it and my gauge popped up to high and i could see it in the the propane moving into the line here and i'm ready to go camping so i hope that this install of the gas stop and the gas gear lines has been helpful to you",

{"id": "PzXlSG_CiuA", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "z-BCe2H45YhX6i_MsftbGFpzE3Q", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and in this video i'm going to install this poynting seven in one antenna and this is what's going to connect to my pepwave cat12 duo cellular router so i'm going to install this on top of my rv so i'm going to walk through the whole process with you from drilling the hole to installing this thing making sure we're all weatherproof whether you're installing the pointing like i am here which if you're installing this one you're certainly going to learn just a lot about this antenna but even if you're installing a different type of antenna i believe you'll learn a lot in this video just as far as the considerations that you need to make whenever you are drilling holes in your rv to mount something on the uh roof anyway this is the pointing seven in one and so if we flip this over uh there are a few mounting options that we have here one is that you can just come straight out of the base which is what we're gonna do so you'll have this uh little base that protrudes out from the bottom here and it's got this screw cap on it so if you can imagine if i unscrew this cap and then i i have a hole in the top of my rv this base will just drop down in that hole and then from the bottom side we'll come back up and screw this uh to the base in addition there is 3m uh 3m tape here that that you'll use to secure it to the roof so and then we'll put a a bead of of dicor around this we'll make sure it's good and good and weatherproof before we're done if you wanted to do if you wanted to mount this and maybe run the cable along your roof and go to a junction box or run a long roof just drop it in somewhere else besides where this is going to be mounted then if you look at the bottom of this this piece comes out and then this this base right here just unscrews and comes out makes the bottom completely flat and then if you you can sort of imagine that then this this cable would just lay flat and come out the back side of this uh that's not what i'm gonna do today but if you want to do that then they certainly have uh the means to do that so you get a little baggie in your kit here and one of the things that you get in here is a longer uh base here so that's the one that comes on it and then you can see there's a long one so uh you know depending on the thickness of your roof you may need to use the longer maybe that would be be better i am certainly installing the longer base on it uh today and so during the process you'll you'll see that uh other than that in here uh there's a few clamps in case you did run this cable along the roof it would give you something to secure it to the roof with and then you have these openings on uh the 3m here the 3m pad here it's actually a pad i think i called it tape earlier it's actually a pad with 3m on both sides and to fill in those holes you have these little discs and that and because i'm going to use the 3m pad i will be using these i believe there's that these right here i've uh heard that there's like magnets that you can uh screw into here but they don't come with the kit and that wouldn't be the way that that i would use this anyway but so i'm just gonna fill these these holes in so anyway uh we're about to get started with this i've got my buddy dennis with me here today who's gonna kind of uh help me with the process and uh you may have met him at some rv shows if you've been to rv shows sometimes he's in our booth but he's super experienced with this type stuff so i figure why not have him along for the ride to uh to point me in the right direction in case i get off the road a little bit so anyway let's go ahead and go inside and take a look at it where we're going to start drilling the hole and the considerations that i am making prior to drilling that hole to make sure that i drill in the right spot all right we made it inside this is a 2016 tiffin faten and so the first thing i want to say is that every rv can be different so if you decide to take this project on obviously you need to look at things as it relates to your rv but maybe some things that i talked to you about today will help you anyway so i've consulted with a lot of people that do a lot of work on rv roofs and drill a lot of holes and and what i'm told is that typically manufacturers will run their wires all the way down the sides or straight down the middle right so those are the areas we we want to stay away from so what i did is that i'm going to install the pep wave in this cabinet right up here and and so i'm going to install the pep wave in the cabinet right here and so what i wanted to try to do is see what was behind some of these panels and so this one just had some screws in it and then i've got a little uh suction cup here i kind of bring it down and then you can kind of see that they've got a few wires running behind here because i'm trying to figure out where to run my power for my pep wave 2 and how i might do that and kind of also see what the situation is as it relates to how the wiring is run in the rv and the my power for my pep wave is going to come up here so pep wave sitting here and then i'll run my power cable and then i'm just going to plug it into a wall outlet so that'll make things real easy i also had another panel up here that i could look behind again to give me some reassurance of hey where do they run the cables in this rv and it does seem to be be true for this rv that they're just running them right down the sides behind all these panels kind of up high so in this cabinet right here i was able to pull the panel off here too and again just trying to see get an idea of how did they run the wires in this rv and in this rv it does seem to hold true that they're just running it straight down the side of my rv which is over to this side and i've got all kinds of goodies in here i mean i see uh ac power in here dc i've got all my stuff for my satellite coming in so some interesting items there but anyway this is just kind of some some due diligence before you get started just kind of see if you can take a peek at things behind the walls and things like that it's not a bad idea the other thing that that we did is i've got speakers uh right up here so there's you can see there's two of them right and i also had two of them here and what i did is went ahead and just pulled these off because i wanted to now peek on the sides now i want to kind of peek up right and so i've done that and i can kind of see especially in this one right here i can kind of go ahead and see the the ply board for the roofing um and and the insulation that we're working with and all that and you know certainly i don't see any wires running along the roof line in either of these spots right here so that's a good sign because i'm going to be drilling almost somewhat in line with this so anyway anything you can peek at before you get started it's a good idea so uh here's what i've been told by the professionals in the market to do this you want to take a small drill bit like even an eighth of an inch if it's a little bit bigger you can use one of those flat spade drill bits which is probably what we'll be using and drill up from the bottom nice and slow right everything's slow in this process right because what you're trying to do here is get a small hole to go up and pierce the top of the roof and the reason that you use a small bit is if you did happen to come across a wire uh that the bit's gonna be so small that'll just roll off of it that's the idea right and so you you drill a small hole from the bottom and then you go on the roof and then that's where you drill your bigger hole from top and then basically you're gonna just start digging insulation out taking it real slow this whole process is all about taking your time so let's go ahead and do that i'm going to get the drill out and get dennis over here with me and me and him are going to start drilling and getting this project started all right it's time to start drilling this is uh dennis everybody and uh he's going to be helping me throughout the process and so again the recommendation from experts i've talked to is if you get like an eighth of an inch drill bit uh if you're going to go any bigger than that then you might consider one of these flat blades this is just a little bit bigger than an eighth but it's it's flat it's called a spade bit and so uh i'm going to go ahead and what what happened here when we were doing our testing we realized up in this cabinet that there was a like a metal plate on the ceiling probably where they're bolting these these cabinets to that's fine we just had to go through that but i went ahead just tap that but now on video i want to show you now the other thing is is that i already know this hole is good and it would be highly recommended that if you're going to do this that you cut all all power to your your rv so we've already done some recon on this so i know i'm good so you'll see my lights on but anyway let's go ahead and start drilling and get a hole up through the roof oh and i've got this 90 degree angle because i've only got so much room in this cabinet to work with so sometimes it might be nice to get like a 90 degree drill bit for your for your drill all right let's do it and the first part of the the wood once we got through the metal is super thin i mean it goes right through it at that point i'm in insulation uh and then and then my next point i'm gonna hit is the ply board on the the ceiling or the roof and i've hit it so here we go there we go all right i'm through all right so we got the hole drilled through up to the roof and we just need to go up there and confirm that i got all the way through and if i did then we're gonna uh drill a bigger hole from the top down and we'll explain that when we get up there so let's head on up all right so we made it on the roof and we have success uh i've got the hole here so what we got is we've got uh fiberglass here and then the plywood underneath that and then of course the insulation so the instructions for the pointing say to get a 22 millimeter that's what the base of that antenna is going to be able to slide down into so that's what i've got on the drill so all i'm going to do is i'm just going to drill through the fiberglass and the wood and then we're going to go back into the rv and drill a bigger bigger hole coming up now that we know we're safe coming up through and there's no wires and uh clear out some space for us to uh start getting some cables through here so let's go ahead and do it all right that does it pretty easy uh again just fiberglass and a piece of wood and then you'll you know on my rv you've got that insulation in there so let's go back downstairs and uh and start drilling from the bottom now all right so here's the next part of the plan uh we're going to take a one we went and got one of these from lowe's it's like something you put in the desk to run cables through and so and that is what's that how many inches is this is two and three eight two so it's i got a two and three eight so we're gonna drill a hole two and three eighths and that's just going to clean it up whenever we're done we'll pop this in there so i don't just have a two and three eighths hole in my ceiling and so uh but by drilling this hole uh it will allow us to then fit if you remember that screw piece that we got a screw back up on the pep wave once we get it installed on the top that's why we're having to drill a bigger hole but no worries because we're going to use this it's going to look real nice so all right so uh we've got this vinyl on on the roof and so when you start using a hole saw like vinyl it really is not uh it's gonna start twisting it so what we did is we went ahead and just cut that piece out as you can see here and so now that we've got that cut out it's time to cut a hole so now that we've drilled through remember we had that metal piece that we had to drill through so that was a bit of a chore there but uh anyway these are the things that that you might run into you to get the job done so now that we've gone through the the uh the sealing part of it now it's just insulation so remember this job's all about taking it easy going slow making sure you're doing it right uh ensuring that you know if there was a stray wire or something which we're confident that there's not but hey we're going to take our time anyway so i'm just going to take a a straight tool like this and just start digging the insulation out until i get to the top should be getting close you see light at the end of the tunnel yep yeah there's the there it is right there all right now i'm 100 sure that there's no wires so now i'm just going to take that drill bit and just run it up through there and get the rest of that insulation out of there like a snowstorm in here all right we got it so the the idea here is that well i don't have that piece with me oh yeah so remember this piece we had this is just gonna pop up in that hole so uh now that we've got this done we're ready to go back on the roof and go ahead and install the pointing antenna get the cable run back down through here and then we'll come down once we're done with that we'll come down here and clean things up so before we go on the roof remember i want to install that longer base onto the pepway so let's get started on that so i can just go ahead and take this uh 3m foam off and then you're going to take this piece away and then this will expose the phillips head screws so we'll just take those out and this should just come right off like that and then we're just going to replace it with the longer pieces here go ahead and get this side started get the other side and then it'll slide down of course now we need to run the wires up through that piece there we go two more screws and we're done here that does it and then this piece just slides right back down over it and gives you that flat surface again put this back on and we're ready to go to the roof and install this okay so uh really before i go on the roof i just want to go ahead and put this on or at least the bottom side of it so only goes on one way here so we want to get this right okay and then remember i said it came with these uh little pads to fill in these additional holes so i'm definitely putting these in to give us a complete flat surface once we seal this up all right that does it we're ready to go all right so we've made it back on the roof uh this is an omni-directional antenna uh it kind of doesn't look like it is but it really is but this is more for aerodynamics so of course you would want to set this on your roof to where the wind's kind of catching it like this so uh the tools of the trade up here are that uh a we got to clean this area right here i've done i did this earlier with just some mild uh soap and i've got some alcohol that i'm gonna do right here before we put it on there and then we're going to use some silicone right around the base of where this goes into the rv right because this 3m is going to do its job to keep moisture out and then we're going to put once it's down then we're going to put some dicor around it so it'll be good and uh and weatherproof so step one is i just need to make sure that it's good and clean here so whatever you need to do with your rv to make that happen now would be the time to do it all right the next step of this is uh we need to start getting the wires through the hole that we drilled and uh you're not gonna be able to just put all these in there at one time so you just take one or two at a time and then just start pushing them through and then once i get them through i've got tammy inside and she's gonna she's gonna pull them through all right that's good okay this couldn't be going better by the way so uh now what we're gonna do is uh you'll see like an indention on the back of this so that's going to be the back and then the the more the shark fin will be on the front and so silicone yeah actually you're right we should go ahead and take this off first so we're ready to roll right so we're going to take this off and then i need to take these baby pieces off all right now it's silicone time and i'm just going to run a bead all the way around this looks pretty darn good that good that's just a safety precaution anyway all right okay and does that look straight yep just that simple we're getting there this is exciting put a little pressure on this thing and we're going to get this dicor bead put on it and then uh and then we're kind of done except for downstairs okay i think i'm gonna let dennis do this i feel like he might do a neater job than me [Music] so dennis why are we using silicone on the bottom and dicor around normally you don't use silicone on the roof of the rv but it's just it's just a precaution to make sure if any water or moisture does seep in under any of this you got that last layer that's going to be some type of barrier to prevent water from coming in and then what's the die core that was that's the dicor is going to seal the outside of this uh antenna so that they can't any moisture or anything penetrate underneath the uh and it's more it's more of a flexible mold right correct it's a self-leveling one so what we're going to do is we're going to put it up here and then you basically got three layers of moisture uh protection you got your dicor then you've got your 3m tape and then you have your silicone on the inside okay yeah we should be good to go should be good to go i think we're good and then that'll just dry and just kind of settle in right that's what that will be all right so uh that i don't think we have to come up here again right i think we're done yeah so we're going to go back downstairs and clean things up get it connected to the pep wave and this job is just about done all right so we're back inside and cable came through just fine as you can see um this really in an install video to show you how to connect this necessarily to the pep wave but uh on this one there's four four cellulars two wi-fi's and one gps and uh it'll be labeled on the back of your pep wave depending on what antenna you've got anyway y'all remember that plastic piece that was screwed on that base all right now it's time to get this back on the cable and run it up through here this is gonna be the tricky part here uh just the way we chose to do this is to be able to go up through that hole and screw this in through the hole that we have here so we got to slide all these in and remember they you kind of got to do them one at a time they're not all going to fit in there at the same time all right so when we go up through here as you can see you know obviously uh you know i'm not gonna be able to reach all the way to the to the um which i can feel it right there maybe i can reach it i thought i was gonna have to use some needle nose but maybe not that would be pretty spectacular if i could get this started oh i think i might have it success nope not success i mean i'm right there i'm gonna get it though to do it blindly there it is so it's on there so now i've just got to screw it up and this is going to again just provide more security um for the pep wave on the roof which with the way we've got it sealed up there it's it's fine but this is this is just extra protection i don't know if we've got enough room for for it to fit down there oh yeah oh they did that there we go i can't see up in there there we go i did it i got that yeah i got the final turn on it so uh oh and then we got our piece where'd that go laying up there all right it's just part of the job people you gotta thread that through um so yeah so this is the part we got from from lowe's and i'm just gonna finish this install up here because we've gone through the main part of kind of of what you need to look at uh but we'll run these um through here well i thought i could fit more at a time than i can and i want you all to see how nice this install is going to be here i'll roll it up and we'll pop that in there and then we'll seal that off but man doesn't that look good yeah and then we'll we'll put my pep wave up in this cabinet and uh and then we'll we'll uh run power to it now the pep wave comes with a hard wired 12 volt or it's got an ac power supply and i've got an ac power supply just just down the cabinet here that i'm just going to run either behind the cabinet or through it and uh and plug it in that's not what this video is all about this was about the install on the antenna and that part is done i guess i just want to close with this and say that uh whenever you're going through this make sure you take those considerations into account whenever you're starting the job take it slow every professional i've talked to about that when it comes to drilling holes in an rv they're like just take it slow use that small drill bit coming up from the bottom cut a hole in the top and then just kind of dig your way in there that's the safest way to do it make sure you kind of know what's going on in your rv uh as it relates to to uh wiring the best that you can and uh and then also whenever you start drilling and things like that it's a good idea to just just cut all your all your power and uh until you get that part of the job done all right so i just really wanted to wrap the video up by just kind of showing you the final uh installation here uh from inside the rv and so i have not cleaned up the major wire coming down but as you can see again we drilled this hole here and bought this piece from lowe's it's just like a piece that goes into a desk that lets a cord come through so that turned out nice and then and then the power uh we basically just drilled a hole there ran the cable we still got to clean it up a little bit but it goes through there the cable comes through these two cabinets here you can see the holes that we've uh put in here and drilled and again we still got to clean up but and then that comes through here and plugs in right up here so we got power to the pep wave no problem so so the pep wave we've actually got just laying in here right now and i've already got it connected here as you can see and i'm going to get a bracket and just probably put it up on the wall here and then i'll do something to clean these these cables up but uh it is working spectacular uh so tammy ran a test before we were in a good place anyway i mean we would get pretty good speeds here so she had 51 down download and nine upload speeds and then after we installed the pep wave she was at 62 down and 26 up so she went from nine up to 26 up on her upload speeds and uh the differences on my computer were a little more dramatic than even that but uh that was off of her computer so it definitely made an immediate difference and you can really just tell just by bouncing forget the speed test i can just tell by just bouncing around on websites and things like that so if you already have a pep wave but you don't have the outside antenna and you're just wondering hey is it worth it to get the outside antenna uh the results that we've seen here and what we see from our customers is that yes it can make a huge improvement to have that antenna outside better line of sight to the uh to the local cell tower and uh and because remember the original results that i shared with you about what tammy had that was with the pep wave with the inside antennas so still good results in this area it can vary in different areas but it was much better with the antenna also if you don't have a pep wave at all and you're just considering which unit is right for you we've got a lot of information over at technorv.com we've got articles we've got videos on our youtube channel comparing all the different units so if you need more information you can check that out or you can call us email or chat with us and we'd be glad to help you i hope this video was

are going to drill a hole in your RV roof, then there are specific things that you must look at before proceeding. Before I started the installation of my Poynting 7-in-1 MIMO Omnidirectional Antenna on the roof of my Tiffin Phaeton, I consulted with many people that drill holes in RV roofs for a living, like satellite installers and RV techs. The considerations on where to drill a hole and the proper method to drill a hole are pretty unanimous. In this video, you will learn the things that I did during the install to ensure I was drilling in the right spot and avoiding areas where wires may be run.

the weather gets just about perfect to take the rv out of storage yes just to go to a nice place or if you're full time like us walking outside and realized wow it's just really nice out here uh but with that said it's may is also uh when we celebrate techno rv's birth yes it's been six years since we were the number six yes is how long we have uh had techno rv here and uh so we wanted to give back on uh techno rv's birthday and so this month we're giving away three thousand dollars worth of gear yes and stuff right and so we thought we would start right now because we're gonna do this we're gonna do one we're gonna do giveaways each week right right we're drawing this saturday right obviously um we're drawing next saturday and the third saturday of the month the last drawing is actually gonna be on may 31st to give everybody an opportunity to get in on that last drawing we draw for two gifts every week um so this week we are drawing four and uh before we say that if if you're registered once you're good right oh yeah if you register once you're good so your name stays in the running until may 31st yes so if you're getting this you registered and you and you could win right now right right so we're gonna replace the fern centerpiece with the surge guard centerpiece and and we're going to give away a surge guard and a gas stop so correct uh real quick this is a full electrical protection system so it's going to protect you against surges high low voltage make sure your pedestal is all wired up correctly and i did just want to mention that we just got done with a interview with mike conway with surge guard and if you're wanting to kind of learn everything there is to know about rv electricity and in these units and why you might need one go watch that video yeah we asked him all the questions probably the most common ones we get from rvers so um it's long but it's got a lot of good information in it that that we got i learned some of that i know i did too yeah i did too so this one is the 34 951 model which is the 50 amp model but if you win and you've got a 30 amp rig then we'll just send you the 30 amp model right because you need to match this with whatever your whatever your rv's and so uh top of the line stuff here surge guard and we're giving it away and tammy has already drawn the name and i say we just hop right to it the winner of the surge guard can i say this one i'll let you say the error okay uh it's joe i know but what do you think his last name is based on his email his last name is probably frank probably frank your email starts with j d frank okay and then there's some numbers but now there's something yeah we'll just leave that out so the way we draw names is i have a computer uh program that randomly selects them i just do it ahead of time it's easier that way instead of us all sitting out here waiting for it to come out joe congratulations congratulations joe frank your rv just got a lot safer yes from the uh from electricity that could go bad yes surge all kind of stuff we hope that doesn't happen but you're going to be good with this and i'll email you and get the address where you want that to be shipped we'll ship that out next week so you should have it soon all right let's move to the next one what are we doing we're doing a gas stop okay this is a uh propane automatic shutoff so if you were to have a like a line rupture or a cut line or something like that if this senses over seventy thousand seventy five thousand uh btu of flow then it would instantly and automatically cut the propane to your to your rv and that 75 000 level is is there so that all your normal appliances will continue to run so yeah that wouldn't be a good feature no it's just every time you could turn your oven on carrick that wouldn't be good uh so no it will let that run but easy to install and we've made some install videos but it it has quickly become part of what we consider the top three safety items for rvers and so it's surge guards the other one of those as well surge guards one entire pressure monitor uh so anyway we're giving away a gas stop to somebody and uh there's two different types and and one is the the acme connection which is going to be more your travel trailer type bottle tanks and then one's the pol which would be in like your class c class a built-in tanks right whatever you got that's what we'll send yeah right and so the winner and i'll let tammy say this one the winner of the gas stop is angie callahan angie callahan i don't know if there are two angie callahan's but your email starts with adsc okay that'll just there are two angie callahan hopefully that'll hopefully we don't have to draw it down any more than that congratulations we will be emailing you to find out if you need the a acme or the pll pol style and the address to ship it to and we'll get that out next week as well so yeah you should see it both the winners we're gonna email get their shipping address so we can get it out and if you didn't win you've still got more opportunities to win one two three four five six more but not this stuff no this is not so if you didn't win this stuff and you and you still want like a gas stop and a surge guard then then just hop over to technorv.com we've got it there if you've got any questions that's what we're here for is a chat email uh call in whatever we're happy to answer the questions and then we ship fast and all that good stuff so congratulations and we will see you all next saturday as the may birthday month rolls

uh we have like our biggest sale of the year in techno army and typically we're going to send that to our new list yeah usually we do a flash sale but this month we're doing it up big yeah this is going to be the biggest one of the year so we figured we would just send it to everybody on this list too which i think a lot of people on this list are already on our newsletter list just wanted to give you the heads up yeah that it's coming and it is it literally is the biggest one of the year spectacular for spring getting everybody ready for rving yeah so anyway that's coming your way sometime this week but uh that's not what you're here for right now anyway and and so uh today we're giving away a tst tire pressure monitoring system for everybody that entered the birthday contest and that's a boring box yeah okay let me open it really and a uh soft start i'll just go ahead and pull it out a soft start uh soft starter for your ac unit and uh whoever wins these is going to be really excited i believe and they as they should be okay so let's give away the tst first all right this is a tst tire pressure monitoring system uh four sensors will come with this this kit cap or flow through capper flow through uh your choice and this is gonna monitor your pressure and your temperature of your tires right and if something gets out of spec or something that it's gonna alarm you of that and uh most blowouts are preceded by low pressure high temperature bowstar uh and so this is going to make sure that you're alarmed of those conditions yeah you get a nail on your tire or something your tire starts to go down you don't know about it this is going to make sure you wouldn't drive a mile without it i wouldn't drive 10 feet with that no you don't you like will stop no if a battery sensor goes out or something you're like change it immediately okay all right tst for sensor tammy's already drawn the winner for it so let's go ahead and say the name the winner's name is ken well that could be a lot of people i know so the ken i'm referring to you have the name you have the word airport in your email account ken airport kenny airport that's a pretty cool name i know i didn't know if that was his name or maybe occupation but but if you're you know you are so if it was his last name i really like that kenny airport yes okay uh hey kenny you just won this congratulations i'll email you and get the shipping address or if you're watching you can just reply and give us your shipping address and we'll get that out to you next week okay so a soft start uh soft starter device for your your ac unit good time of year to put one of these jokers on yes if you're in a 30 amp rv uh if you want to run that 30 amp rv on say a 2000 watt generator uh that's probably just not gonna happen because whenever you turn your ac unit on the spike whenever it is cranking that ac up is too much for that this levels out that spike so that you can run a 30 amp rv on a 2000 watt generator or if you have an rv like we do which is 50 amp two to three air conditioners usually come on a 50 amp and when you're on 30 amp you probably know this but you can only run one air conditioner so if you put soft starts on your air conditioners on a 50 amp you can run two at the same time on a 30 amp pedestal which we've been in plenty of parks with 38 oh yeah and we had to run one well sometimes state parks only have 30 amp or maybe it's that the 50 amps aren't available and you're willing to stay at a 30 amp but yeah you know but with this you can run two and it's it's really easy to install and you can actually do an install like while uh somebody at soft starts on the phone with you telling you okay yeah it's really easy enough of that let's give it away uh again tammy has drawn the name this one has a last name on it okay let's see if it's as cool as uh kenny airport that's a lot of pressure for this person well i'll just say it corey fletcher corey fletcher you are the winner of a soft start rv soft starter an equally cool name yes corey fletcher okay corey and i think that one's pretty self-explanatory you just won the soft start okay everybody so listen we have two more weeks of this to go uh that we'll be giving away more stuff and we have left to give away a tire minder a we boost reach cell booster avayar 450 tire inflator and a vision works seven inch rear view observation camera system lots of good stuff and keep an eye out for your email this week for literally like i'm not just saying this it's the biggest sale of the year

{"id": "ha5QbAu8_9w", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "oVcxUzVCM9L_vF51lRH6I4invbQ", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and i had a blowout on my steer tire in this class a doing 65 miles per hour and just for the pure education of it i felt like i needed to share my experience from sort of beginning to end share with you what i think went wrong how i handled the situation and how it turned out as you may know that having a steer tire blow out on a big rig like this is instant danger uh you may see videos on youtube of rvs flipping over running into guard rails it usually doesn't doesn't end good and so i just want to go through it with you and make sure that i talk through each step of of what happened and so that uh maybe it can help you in the future before i start tire safety has has always been kind of my thing in fact with my business techno rv we actually travel around and do seminars on on tire safety so you might think well how in the world would would would you have a blowout and and so that's kind of the things i want to i want to talk about here um i don't suspect there's too many people that take take better care of their tires than i do i keep them clean i keep them covered so that there's no long-term exposure to to sunlight uh i if i'm parked on one like cement for a long period of time i'll park on pads because if you're on cement for long periods of time the compounds can start to leach out of your tires which isn't good for them i take all these precautions in addition the main thing you got to do right is have proper psi i've had this motorhome wade i know i'm dead on on exactly the psi that i'm supposed to be running on this rv and i do run a tst tire pressure monitoring system and i know that that was working and i know that i had uh proper pressure and proper temperature when this blowout happens so what i tell people is that tire pressure monitoring systems in most cases will prevent a blowout because most blowouts are preceded by low pressure high temperature maybe you get a nail in your tire the pressure in your tire starts to go down as it goes down the heat goes up and whenever a tire gets to 200 degrees or a little north of 200 degrees the compounds in the tire start to break down that's when blowout happens but i'm always careful to say tpms can can alarm you and prevent most situations there's those those rarities like that happen to me that are just catastrophic tire failures that can be a mystery but i am going to uh try to uncover that mystery and make sure that uh that that that i know and that you know exactly what happened and how this could have happened to me so let's get right into the blowout tammy and i are coming up a four-lane highway coming back from tuscaloosa to mobile we're actually in mississippi and i'm doing about 65 miles per hour and there's not a lot of people on the road and i'm on a straightaway and i'm in i'm in the right-hand lane and just out of nowhere i mean first of all the blowout itself is is shocking it's a it is a pure shotgun sound i'm talking about the decibel levels of it in my case it was my front passenger uh steer tire which was basically running right under tammy and she actually could just feel it well i could feel it too but the explosion was intense so once the explosion happens you're you're pretty much under attack immediately uh everything changes and you're you're going off of instinct now because i've done this done a lot of seminars and been to a lot of seminars and i've watched all the videos on what are you supposed to do in a blowout and what you're supposed to do in a blowout is you're supposed to give it the gas because whenever you have a blowout the the side force is intense and it starts immediately so when you're driving the your your uh your direction has you going this way when whenever you have a blowout you have this intense side force so in order to level out that side force you're supposed to floor it on the gas right and what that does is that gives you some momentum to pull that side force back forward and so i knew this i've watched that video before uh i've trained on it but let me tell you something when it happens you're purely going off instinct and i've gone through this in my head a thousand times i told tammy i said when that blowout happened my foot went straight to that accelerator and and that was pure instinct but as i was replaying the story in my mind i was like you know i know i did throw my foot to that accelerator but i really don't recall give pushing it or if i did i probably didn't even push it hard enough to even get the rpms back up to make a difference and then it occurred to me i was on cruise control when the blowout happened my speed of course came down and the cruise control on this rv is pretty intense if it's if it starts getting blower if i start going up a hill i mean it'll flat floor it to get me back up to speed so when i threw my foot down to that accelerator the accelerator was just kind of gone i mean i reached for it but the the acceleration had already begun with the cruise control now if the cruise control wouldn't have done it luckily that's where my foot went and that was the idea of it was for me to for me to give it the gas but it was already giving it the gas now this this transition from the side force to to having forward momentum again in my case didn't didn't take long and the idea and to like gain speed it's just to get that forward momentum going back uh in the right direction and and everything happened so fast from when it happened to whenever i was stopped on the side of the road i suspect it was no more than 15 seconds uh maybe 20. so as soon as the blowout happened my foot goes to the accelerator of course the cruise control's already kicked in you you can't help but to get into the steering wheel and i'm talking about it's it's a struggle i mean you're fighting it and and i was definitely in the fight so i went ahead and tapped my brakes that disengages the the cruise control now when i i had my exhaust brake turned on on my class a so what starts happening my rv starts downshifting which was another beautiful part of this in my mind now that i'm thinking back through it it starts downshifting now i'm tapping on the brakes and i'm also thinking i like for just instinct i'm like i want to i just want to get off the road i don't want to just stop in the middle of the highway and you don't really have time to think about like what's my plan right here right so as i'm starting to to get my speed a little slower i go ahead and start easing now i'm still pulling this way but i'm starting to let it go a little bit to get the tire that has blown out off the road as soon as that tire hit off the side of the road the the fight started again and i guess i just i didn't realize this and didn't have time to really think about it of what kind of soil that was over there but it was pretty soft so when that blown out tire hit that dirt it was another wave of intense force that way now the problem with that was i had about enough room to park the rv on the side of the road plus about four or five feet before there was a ditch that tire was off the road i would say probably maybe a foot well as soon as i felt it start pulling that way i knew i just needed to hold it there as long as i could and make sure that my driver's side tire stayed on on the concrete to sort of give me that driving power right so and you can see uh we videoed the tire path as it came off as i came off the interstate and you can see that wow my tire hits off about a foot and then it just stays there for a hundred yards i don't know 150 yards or something like that because my intent was just to pull off the side of the road but when that side force happened i started fighting it again and i kept it right there and then as my speed got lower and i was just gently tapping the brakes and my rv was down shifting when i got down to a speed to where i knew it was safe to just sort of dive the rv off the road just to get off of the interstate that's what i did i dove off and pulled it in and if you can see from the picture of me on the side of the road uh i'm literally the rv in the jeep that i'm towing is literally perfectly parallel with with the side of the road i don't honestly i don't park this good in rv parks sometimes but i did it with a blowout and uh and i really attribute it to uh those things and how i gain control so when you see the video of what are you doing a blowout you floor it and then it's about feel how long do you floor it i don't know in my case it was it just felt like just a few seconds and then i was tapping the brake now this could be different in different situations but a lot of it is on field again there's no playbook when it starts believe me there's no playbook it's a it's a definitely a scary situation i wouldn't wish it on anybody and but i feel like that the methods that i took whatever my instincts were in that situation i was able to park that rv perfectly you know we weren't injured and the rv was just fine aside from the blown out tire now the tire came apart in a bad way and you hear about uh you know people that have blowouts and it can really tear things up there's really not a whole lot under there but there is the gas hose that comes from the nozzle opening on that side and it didn't knock that off from the nozzle opening up top and that's really it it was still fully secured at the gas tank side of things but i guess if the scenario could have been different maybe it would have knocked that off and i might have been spilling gas everywhere i guess but that's not what happened and so now we're sitting on the side of the road and uh and and uh after you get over the shock of it uh for a little bit and and tammy literally as soon as we stopped reached over threw her hand up and said high five and we we high-fived and and had a little moment because we knew like it usually doesn't end like this right so we were thankful for that well now we're on the side of the road we get out assess the situation i do have some safety triangles that i carry with me that are very well lit up and have these lights on them and i went ahead and set those out um on the side of the road so that people would know when they came up on us that you know we were there for a reason and they should move over so i would definitely recommend having some of those so i do have a membership to coachnet and i remember whenever i signed up with them and maybe they're all like this i don't know but at the time that i signed up for for this uh and by the way we've been rv uh full-time rving since 2014 and we've been in this rv since 2016. so i've had coachnet for quite a while never had to use it but i remembered they had an app and because i'm like i'm never going to remember what to do like who to call you know when something happens but on the app when you hit it it basically pulls up your account number the number uh to call and it's just real easy so i pulled my app up luckily we had cell service barely called them they were super nice asked me you know is or is it an emergency you know are you off the road i'm like yeah everything's fine they want to make sure you're okay and so uh i told them what was going on i'm like well look i'm in an rv like like whoever's coming out here to change this tire i need them to bring the gear for an rv and they're like fine you know we got you covered so i know they're at the mercy of uh of whoever in the area can do it and this is kind of where the problem started it took about six hours for somebody to show up by this time it's dark it's raining um but we're in an rv and we tammy and i are pretty relaxed people so we're like whatever we turned some music on and sat there and just hung out in the rv and at one point a police officer actually pulled up he was running up and down the road giving tickets and i was wondering why he hadn't pulled over to check on us but he ended up pulling up and he said hey what are y'all doing i said well i had a blowout and he said really he said i thought y'all were like letting your dog out or something he came and looked at the tire and he said you parked it like that would that blow out so apparently that's he he typically sees other things with a blowout like that um but anyway we were safe on the side of the road so somebody shows up and i can i already sense like they know the tire i need and all that i already sense that that he he doesn't have the gear to do what i need done right so he gets out walks over and looks at it and i said is this going to be a problem and he says yeah i'm not going to be able to do that now we've already sat there for six hours so i said well i said i tell you what i said you got the tire i said uh i really don't want you to leave until this is done i said so me and you were about to figure this out and he said well my jack is you know this tall to start off with and and that tire was probably uh a third of the way up the rim and so that side there was no way to get the jack up under there so i said well i tell you what i said i've got uh some hydraulic jacks on the front of my rv and i said uh i know that that's not really what they're made for designed for is to just be lifting your rv up to change a tire but i'd been there for six hours and that's what i was doing so tammy got in uh i had one of those bigfoot plates that i was able to get up underneath the uh the jack because the dirt was soft and we raised it as as high as we could get it and he said that's still not high enough and i said well it's not high if it's not high enough i said guess what we dig so we started digging because i couldn't get it any higher that means the earth has got to get lower so we started digging i got to a point to where he's like okay i can get the tire off so he gets the tire off but i knew that when the new tire came in fully inflated that that more digging was gonna have to happen right so while he was changing the tire i kept digging and kept digging and kept digging and so uh he got the tire on and uh and that all went good i guess all in we were probably seven and a half hours sitting there so a blowout can really you know ruin a nice trip you know for sure especially if you're having to get somebody to come change a tire for you like you are with the uh with the class a's so the tires changed you know we get back on the road all is good now uh i decided that i needed to know what what happened with the tire i'm gonna show you all the tire here in just a second so i called pressure systems international out of texas we do some work with them on some different things and i asked them i'm like look i know y'all got a lab y'all inspect tires for all kinds of stuff i'm like do you think that you could inspect this tire and uh and tell me like what happened you know because right now it's like it's just a torn up mess and they're like yeah we could probably get a really good idea so i'm gonna ship this tire to them and really it's just from an educational standpoint because it is what it is at this point but i want to know i want to know what happened specifically that tire where did the blowout happen uh was there damage on the inside that i wasn't able to tell and then you know that way i can share so basically they're gonna do do sort of an autopsy on on the tire and uh i think that'll be some some good information to get so what do i think happened well know i take good care of my tires and i know that there's those rarities that are a myst mystery that it's just like you just it just happened you know but these things are super rare again most blowouts are preceded by an issue and this one was not so here's my theory until i get the results back from the lab on my my tire when we rolled back from the tampa rv show early 2020 into mobile alabama my tires uh were gonna be five years old that year okay i've got a date code of my on my tires of 27 so that's the 27th week of 2015. and so uh basically and tammy and i talked about this we're like look you know i know the general rule of thumb is that you know between five and seven years on an rv tire in my case as much as we're on the road and everything i'm i'm thinking uh i'm thinking that uh you know i'm just gonna change them out at five years right like like i'm not gonna try and to to uh you know you know save some some money to try and extend them although i guess i could and and this is no slam to anybody that does that if if that's what you're doing that's fine but for me i was just going to change them at five years well when the the kovid thing hit we were like well we're just going to stay here and then techno rv continued to grow and we were sort of grounded all year so as the five years came up i was like well i don't really want to change my tires for me to just sit here for the next six to eight months and we're we've only got just like a a few little trips that we're going to do um and we should be good because this thing to tuscaloosa was only three and a half hours so they sat tires don't like to sit and they should be exercised which we did uh but maybe not enough is kind of what i'm thinking okay i took it out on two small trips like hour and a half just to roll the tires during that long period of time and then we also uh went to tampa in january we made a trip to pensacola which was like i don't know an hour and a half away and i think we might have went one other place um but they they sat for a long time i don't think that helped the case the only other thing that i can think is that did i have some damaged cords on the inside of that tire that i couldn't see before i left that morning i did an inspection on my tires probably better than i normally do because i had to change out a battery sensor on my tire pressure monitoring sensors and so uh when i was doing that i did a serious inspection on the tires just a visual inspection and i know that tire just from what i could tell is is that there was no bulges there was no cuts there you know i didn't see any nails or anything like that now could i have an had some internal damage and didn't know about it possibly usually over time those will show up with like a bulge or something like that but i could have had some core damage you know you go down the road you hit a pothole maybe it just damages a cord just a little bit these things aren't self-healing so they just sit there and then maybe you hit another pothole and maybe you've got another little imperfection in on the inside of your tire that you don't know about these things can happen and then they just build on each other i'm totally guessing but this is my theory at this point when i get the tire back i will certainly share that information so what i thought i would do is just take a flip screen here and let's take a look at the tire and then we'll close the video out all right so this is it and i personally don't know of any way to look at this and make anything out of it uh i assure you that uh any part you see on this tire that is an imperfection at this point it was not there before like this this split here uh you know did the blowout happen here i don't know because you know it took so much abuse once the the uh the blowout happened but you can see that the the entire tread uh once the blowout happened started to to come off and i suspect the details of of what happened are are inside this tire that a professional could look at it and maybe just maybe give me an idea this is this is the inside of the tire um and then and then this was was the outside of the tire so uh what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna send this off in addition i'm going to send off my other steer tire that's a good a good tire but it's you know it's uh what five and a half years old now or something uh well going on six so i'm going to also send that tire along with this one and uh and ask them to look at that too to see if if there's anything that they can make of of that tire is as well so uh anyway that's kind of it i i really just you know because we talk tire safety so much i thought man i had a blowout i gotta share this and and and make sure that people know the things that i did when that blowout happened to make sure this rv was parked safely so if there's anything that you i'm not saying i did everything perfect but if there's anything that you can learn from this that would be that would be great so one last thing that i will say that i don't believe i mentioned earlier when the blowout happened uh my tst monitor immediately went out now you know you might say well what good is that the blowout just happened uh well in this case uh nothing but if that had been on my jeep and i wouldn't have known about it i can tell you the tst went off immediately and the sensor that was on this tire when we came to a stop was buried uh in in in the dirt and so when he changed the tire out i pulled the sensor out and of course i still needed to go another you know hour and a half to get home uh it definitely had some nicks and scrapes on it i shook it off cleaned it up screwed it back on and uh the thing worked perfectly so of course i'll go ahead and replace it just as a precaution but i can tell you it brought everything back in so i'm still a big tst fan so that kind of does it i hope that uh something in this video will help you understand uh you know the effects of a steer tire blowout and how that you may can be thinking about how you might react should it ever happen to you i hope it never does and uh and i'll just leave it at that", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2021-05-14T18:34:06Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "We had a Blowout on our Motorhome

{"id": "tZsDqFy_vQo", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "MmyLNRxtha9Tgqq57mN_xkveCe8", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and this is my forest river rockwood mini light and i'm about to give it a little upgrade so uh these twist lock plugs i'm not crazy about them and i like to replace them with the smart plug because i get better electrical transfer from the pedestal to the rv it's less heat on the plug with these units which is always a positive and in addition instead of this twist lock style that can be cumbersome at times just trying to get it lined up and everything this is just basically a plug in and snap so what i'm going to do is i'm going to replace the inlet with this and instead of replacing the plug head on my existing uh cable i am going to just use the smart plug cable that already has the smart plug head attached to it so let's go ahead and start the install of course the first thing you want to do is you know you got to be unplugged from power do whatever you got to do to make sure there's no stray voltage i have a south wire non-contact voltage tester so i'm just going to be testing throughout the process just to make sure there is no voltage on the line anywhere shouldn't be but uh a nice handy tool there so the next thing is there's just four screws here so we're going to take that out got that out now let's have a look behind here and basically it the the process can vary a little bit [Music] for different models you may just see different things back here i mean basically at the end of the day it's all wires coming up to the back of your inlet but how you disassemble it from here could vary but this looks pretty straight forward here so i'm going to go ahead and i've got some screws in here that i need to take out and i've got two screws back here that need to come out okay now that uh this is off what i can do is i can go ahead and loosen the wires up from the back of the uh the plug head here and then this is gonna allow me to then take this casing off so i'm gonna again we know there's not power here right but it's always a good idea just to go ahead and have one of these because it just doesn't take any time to to uh to test that and i'm gonna need a small flat head so then that comes off and then of course your your casing and your gasket can come off there so at this point you just want to inspect the wiring and make sure it's good and clean and not corroded if it is you need to clean it up this one's new so it looks great but again if it didn't i may even consider cutting this off and stripping me out some new wire here in this case it's not necessary so now it's time to install the the smart plug onto the wire here so when you open this on the back of here there's like a little strain relief you can go ahead and take that off and i don't think in this case we're even going to need to use the strain relief and then as you can see everything is sort of color coded here you've got your little black ring here and your white ring here and then the green for your ground and so i'm just going to make sure that my black wire goes here my white wire goes here and then my ground down to bottom be sure to read the instructions to make sure that you're clear on all this as you're going through it and you want to make sure you get it right the first time all right so uh one thing that i had checked before i started um is the the whole pattern in most cases is going to be the exactly the same and so uh one good way to do that is you can take this piece off of the back of the the smart plug and just kind of run it over the wire here and just look and make sure that these four holes here in this gasket line up and of course i already knew it that it did if not you may have to drill some uh some holes but in most cases you won't have to so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and take the the 3m tape off the back of this gasket and go ahead and put it on more permanently onto my smart plug and this will serve as my gasket uh here so just want to put this over make sure the holes line up perfect okay so again we're to the point to where we're installing the wires and the kit comes with this tool here to tighten and loosen the screws on the side and so it's it's time to do that so it's time to get the wires uh in here again very important uh follow the instructions make sure you follow the color coding make sure that you're you're very comfortable with uh you know obviously the black goes to black the white goes to white and then your your ground wire is going to go to green now these wires can be a bit hard to sort of maneuver and bend and so instead of just putting one in there and cranking down on it and then trying to get the other one it really makes it difficult that way so it's it's better to go ahead and spend a little bit of time right now to go ahead and line these up to where you can just slide all three of them in at the same time and uh everything can't be easy right so it's just part of the installation process to try and get all of these lined up to where they all just slide in at the same time and if you do it this way you're going to be happy you did so my white one still needs to come in just into hair there we go okay now we're doing good so i'm gonna get that comes with the kit from smart plug so you're just going to crank down here to make sure you get a good tight connection i'm going to roll over here to my neutral tighten that down and then my ground wire there we go all right so they're all in uh we're almost done here because really all that's left oh the strain relief uh look at your installation and see if it's not required on on all installations and i'm not going to use it on on this one but uh if you um have a scenario where you you kind of go in and it it makes a sharp turn in here uh with the wiring here then sometimes you may consider using that strain relief if you feel like you're getting a lot of tugging on the wires in this case it's not so really all it is now is just pushing this back up in here it already looks good and then lining up the holes and i'm going to use the same screws that uh that i used or that i that that came with the the rv here so again a part of the process that you just got to take your time and i didn't use my own tip there so a lot of times it's easier just to let this thing come back a little bit and see what you're lining up with the hole and certainly don't crank down on one screw before you get them all lined up that would not work good this is a easy easy install we're almost done we'll get in front of the camera here for a second for this last one and then let's just bring them all in together that gasket on the back will seal it up keep it nice and dry getting close here it's looking good i use that drill taking these out but i don't recommend using a drill putting them back in i like hand tightening them smart plug inlet is installed that is a great upgrade and in addition for this i can replace the plug head on my existing uh cord hand me that real quick if i wanted to um so this is my existing plug head obviously that's not going to work with the smart plug now so you can get a kit where you uh cut this off and just replace it with a smart plug head or you can just buy a new cable which is what i did and so the end of the cable that plugs into the pedestal right here that has not changed okay so there's there's no concern on that end uh the plug head that has changed is this end right here and so i want to show you how easy uh this is once you um it's even got a little plug cover it's nice remember all that uh twist lock plug business of trying to get that on there watch this now when you go to plug in done it's just like that and it's super tight super secure again your uh your your pins here have much more surface area than what i just replaced it with so i'm going to get better electrical transfer again better heat on the plug that is my upgrade today for my rockwood mini light and that is how you install the inlet on this unit and really any other unit if you do want to replace the plug head i do have another install video where i install and in and out and replace the plug head so you can go check that out as well and you can get all of this smart plug product at technorv.com

and this is the tour of the inside of it so come on in and check it out i think you're gonna like it i hate to say something that's important to us in an rv is the bathroom but it kind of is uh i'm kind of a big guy i need my space and uh tammy likes a big bathroom too so this one kind of knocked it out of the park on that one because uh you've got a nice wide entrance here it's got a sliding door here here i'm gonna climb up in here so as you can see i've gotten in rv showers before like i'm like this right so i'm 6'3 i want to talk about my weight really but kind of a big guy so i can really move around on this and i like that another feature in here is that it has the water miser so if you're trying to conserve your uh fresh water say you're not connected to city water and you're trying to uh conserve that then you just turn that switch on that water miser while you're heating the water up it'll flush that water back down into your fresh tank until it heats up and then you turn it comes out of the shower head a nice way to conserve there uh it's got your nice uh foot pedal flush here on the toilet it's uh nice it's got a nice storage in here so we got a few towels in here a few baskets and a decent sink area with a little overhead area so anyway we really like this and i do want to talk about this door because they probably had a lot of options here but if you put a swing door on here it either takes space away from from the bathroom or it takes space away from out here so you put a slide door on so we really like that so you know right when you enter the the front door you kind of got your kitchen cabinet here and they're pretty deep in there so i don't think you can fit a lot of stuff in there we got a lot of stuff in there then you have your ac controls here now i've got a 15 000 btu ac unit on uh this unit they come with a 135 which you can upgrade which is what i did and then i also put the uh soft start ac controller on the unit and i've got a video showing me doing that install and what that does is basically levels out that spike when an ac starts up and so it allows me to maybe run this on say a 2000 watt generator where otherwise i would not be able to do that so the soft start is another addition that i made here as we kind of swing around the corner here you've got your tv with with a sound bar and then sort of all your controls for your your radio uh the speakers and your tv are all right here and it is set up on zone so i could uh you know set my zone up to where i've got my maybe my radio on outside if i'm sitting outside i can bring it in to where it's playing inside so i like how it's not like you turn it on and just every speaker in this thing is is fired up it's not like that it's it's also uh bluetooth enabled so you could hook your your phone up to it and uh play your music it's got a dvd player in here so that's nice fireplace uh on a super cold night i will tell you if you turn this fireplace on uh it can run you out of here i mean it really warms it up in here which is a good thing and uh so i really like the addition of this because it actually works it's pretty but it actually works as well so more controls right here and so you've got all of your lights right here your interior ports your awning uh that's how you would turn the the wi-fi ranger on right here and then you got your little sticker here on how to go to the url and enter your um the ip address to kind of get that thing fired up and then you've got your in and out for your slides right here and then you've got your awning extender and if we go back over here you've got your gauge for your battery your fresh water tank all this better be empty yep empty black gray and then gray number two and then you've got your water pump here and then you've got the gas and electric uh water heater and it's also got a tank heater on it so if you're in some really cold weather then you just turn your hanging tank heater on you don't really have to worry about that anymore so that's that's nice as well uh if i kind of turn around this way we did opt for the theater seating heated and massage chairs uh super nice they're really big and uh again for a big guy like me uh they do good it's got some storage in here and then these pop out and then you've got your your uh your cup holders and then it's actually got uh this little uh piece right here there's actually a little table that's on a rod that sticks in here and you can swing around uh what we did is we bought our own tables and so this is this does not come with the rv by the way uh if you buy one of these but um you can get something similar to this they're super thin so i can set something here or if i'm gonna eat dinner i can just turn this around to me and then we added these baskets with the cushions on them so if we did see some people in the park that we knew and we need to get out of the rain or something we got a few extra places for them to sit down at and so anyway we've been super pleased with that okay i hate to keep spinning you here but uh i guess that's what i'm going to do so entering into the kitchen first of all um solid fronts on all the cabinets solid wood fronts so that is nice and uh good hinges it is something that i do whenever i go into an rv especially if i'm in an rv show and i'm just looking around at all the different rvs for whatever reason i always go to their hinges i want to see what kind of hinges they put on to make sure they put ones that are sufficient for the cabinets and these are you do have your your microwave up here and then you've got your stovetop burner and a little a little oven here we're not big oven people so uh we haven't done a whole lot with that but we did uh add this little unit here and you've got your 110 outlet in the back and then this is your your controller for solar so again these come pre-wired with solar and then it's up to you if you want to add the the solar panel which we did and so this is the controller for that it's got a double basin sink and solid countertops and then again um you know you've got lots of storage and then again up top i think we've already showed these but i mean there's a pretty good bit of storage in this thing so at least good enough for us uh if we spin back around this way you've got your your dometic freezer and refrigerator and so uh they're actually not on right now but you can kind of see the inside of them and it is uh gas or electric by the way so i'm not sure i know how to use these things to keep these open okay there we go all right all right before we go into the bedroom uh i did want to point out that it does have a countertop that flips up so anytime in an rv where you can do something sort of creative to create space but yet be able to just get rid of it to where then you have the walk-in space it's always a good thing so that's good for you that like to cook and you need more counter space you got it right here all right here's the bedroom and so what we what we like about this is that you have a walk around on on both sides and it's got a queen size bed in it and then you have uh you have you know again more storage across the top and you have sort of a closet space over here and the closet rod and then more storage space over here so you can put whatever you want to over here if you just want to put clothes or just more storage we did opt for the tv as you can see over in the corner there and that is the same tv that you would take off and use outside uh if you want to do that and then it's also got some nice charging centers that you really can't get a good uh look at that but it's uh usb charging centers over here and in addition just like they did the door on the the bathroom where they want to swing indoors in here to take up your space right it's got it's got the sliding door so it doesn't take up any space and still gives you uh privacy which for us it's privacy from no one because we're usually in this thing by ourselves but anyway that is the interior of the rockwood 2511 s and i hope you enjoyed the tour", "snippet": {"publishedAt":

{"id": "FdEmO4C9Pfs", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "ssRzYGlnknMsyMBlb4868rGgj3g", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and this is my rockwood mini light 2511 s by forest river i'm super proud of it and i thought i'd just tell you a little bit about it today so in this video i just want to do a walk around the outside just give you some specs and some things i like about it and then in another video i will do a walk around of the inside of the uh of the trailer so let's just start with uh the reason that i bought a forest river obviously there's a lot of different choices out there and there's a lot of good brands out there the main reason that i chose this forest river is i've actually owned a forest river before we had a columbus fifth wheel and it was awesome we never really had any problems out of it and it rode good down the road it was comfortable inside the construction was great on it and so whenever i went to look for a travel trailer i went straight back to forest river and i think throughout this video you'll kind of see some of the features that it have and the construction of it on things that are important to me and that are probably important to you so let's just talk about some just general specs before uh we start walking around so this unit weighs a little over 54 100 pounds and uh it it has a cargo carrying capacity of a little more than about 300 pounds so that was good enough for me it is 25 feet 10 inches long and it is 10 feet 11 inches tall uh the tongue weight on it is about 714 pounds so if you if you roll all this up and think about sort of what you can control it with i happen to have an f350 but i certainly don't need that for this but i use that for a lot of other things too but you can certainly get away with like a 1500 truck to pull this quite easily so i want to start at the front of the trailer here but before i do let's talk about the tanks it's got a 52 gallon fresh tank and it's got a 60 gallon gray tank and a 30 gallon black tank so some pretty good measurements there uh so let's just start at the front i do have a power tongue jack on here remember the tongue weights about 714 pounds so uh i'm not interested in cranking that up on my own so it's got a nice uh tongue jack on it it has two 30 pound propane tanks on it and i'm not going to dig into that right now because in another video i've installed the gas stop automatic shut off devices on the propane tanks and so i'll really dig into to behind the box here on on that other video and then right behind the the propane uh tanks you you have your you have your battery boxes here all right let's talk a little bit about the construction of the unit it does have an aluminum frame it has fiberglass siding and this is vacuum laminated it's all one piece construction on the sides and on the roof and the roof is a vinyl rubber uh composite membrane and so the the insulation values are really good on this and i'm just going to put those up on the screen here for you but it's it's insulated uh on the underbelly on the sides and in the roof and uh the many many times that we've had the sat on the road at different parts and different weather it does uh hold its temperature well on the inside uh as it should all right so i thought what we would do is just walk down this side and then i'll just point some things out to you i did get the power uh extended jacks uh here and here's sort of the button for it and you can hear them coming down here that's a upgrade you don't have to get that if you don't want to but i kind of like it and you got to have storage right so let's take a peek inside of here this this storage unit is a pass-through so it goes all the way from one side down to the other and for a unit this size uh i mean you're not gonna be able to put your whole house in here right but uh it there's plenty of room in here to put some chairs and some supplies and things like that and so i thought there was actually some good good space here and we're making good use of it here so nice pass through there it does have a 17 foot awning all the way across the top here tammy reminded me that that perhaps i should have washed it before uh the video but i did not and uh i figure you'll you'll forgive me that i did upgrade to the thermopain windows i really like an rv that's insulated well and so that's why i was interested in the r factors that we talked about earlier and uh so anytime i can get an upgrade on something that's going to keep the unit more insulated i'm going to do it so these are thermapen windows and so that's nice so might be wondering what this bracket is right here so this unit comes with a lp griddle and so it just connects to this bracket right here you just take it on take it off so it's it's really simple and then your lp connection is just you see the sticker right here right up underneath here so you pop it on there connect it you're cooking away uh got your hot water heater right here just a bourbon water heater and then i went ahead and just set this up you don't leave this out going down the road right but it's basically just another bracket here sort of like that one but it comes with this cool table so you got a little table you can i don't know get your uh food prep done here and do your cooking over here so i'm just going to set this off to the side because i want to start focusing a little bit uh down here now another important thing to me is to always have good tires on an rv and unfortunately a lot of times when you buy rvs uh especially travel trailers they don't have the best of tires on them and and so forest river kind of amped it up as it relates to that because these units actually come with goodyear uh goodyear tires on them and they're they're the st 205 75 radials with a 14 inch rim and so i was really super pleased with that this unit also comes standard with a tire pressure monitoring system on it the industry standard is tst so forest river is partnered with tst so these have internal sensors on them and when you buy your unit you'll have have the monitor that comes with this unit and that'll basically sit up in your truck and it's gonna tell you your your temperature and your pressure of your tires while you're going down the road and so super important most blowouts are preceded by low pressure high temperature with a good tire pressure monitoring system you're always going to know what is going on back there so nice ad also made another video showing you how to program your internal sensor so you can check that out as well as far as i'm going to swap sides with you here real quick as far as the axles are concerned and probably not going to get a real clean shot of this but they're the dexter tour flex in fact i've still got my sticker here it's the rubber torsion suspension axles so they're really nice axles it really rides well down the road so as it relates to tires axles i'm really super pleased with it i also wanted to point out that this unit has a covered underbelly and so basically what that means first of all it protects it from the elements but it's also more insulation value as it relates to that and there's like a radiant foil barrier on the underside of this and again all these things just speak to the things that forest river did in this unit to make sure that it's well insulated that you're comfortable inside of your unit i got a couple speakers here and uh on the video where we talk about the inside we'll sort of sort of show you that system but there's basically different zones you can set up so you can have these speakers on or the ones inside or all of them whatever you want to do it's super flexible uh you have you some 110 outlets out here and then this would be a bracket for a tv so if you if you get the bedroom tv uh then that tv is the one that that comes out and just just slides in here so you just move it back and forth between the bedroom and uh and here so that's nice so we do have the more ride steps and these are just the flip steps so uh whenever you open the door to the rv whenever you get ready to leave right these just flip up into uh the rv and then you close your your door behind them and it basically just makes it super stable even the uh the the fifth wheel that we had um they weren't putting these on them at the time and they just weren't as sturdy in fact the the the uh the class a that i have doesn't even have steps as sturdy as these so uh if you have a unit you get a chance to put some of these more rides on it i would certainly uh recommend that so as we kind of come back to the back here again this is the other switch for the the drop down uh jacks here and so that kind of takes care of the front side here let's walk around the back now you do have the bumper here that the ends pop out and you can slide your sewer hose in you do have a little shower back here on the back i haven't actually used that uh yet but it's got one and if that's uh something that appeals to you then you know you're covered there does have a a connection point here for a hitch if you want to put you know some bikes on there or something like that then there's certainly a place for that and then you have a full-size uh spare tire here as well i don't want to pass uh of course these are the easier uh the ladder to get up on the roof but you do have a tank flush back here and uh so that's always nice who doesn't want to flush their tanks out from time to time right uh on the back this unit uh came with a uh a it's pre-wired for the furion mounts and so uh we we opted for the the vision works uh brand of rear observation cameras uh it is certainly something that we we have over techno rv but uh it is only because we we love them they're just they've got the the uh the clarity and the brilliance on the monitor that uh you have up in your truck is just leaps and bounds above the competition so that is actually a vision works that you can get the uh furion adapter uh plate with it so it fits on there real nicely super easy to install as well this unit comes with a 13500 btu ac it is an upgrade to get the 15 000 which is what we did and again we're all about comfort right you got to have that insulation got to have a good a good ac so we did opt to do that okay we uh kind of flop sides here on the rv because the of the light that was coming in here so anyway we'll just start on this side of the rv and walk down and kind of point out uh all the features so on the front side here you just got your water connection and then your fresh water tank uh well i'm sorry your fresh water tank fill is here and your uh your city water connection is here and then uh this is all about uh winterizing your your unit here so on the inside of uh of this bay here which is the pass-through we do have this door right here on the front here is where all of your uh winterization uh processes will will take place so i'm not going to open that up because that's uh i live in the south i've never had to do that before right so anyway uh this were it does have two slides so this is where this comes out at you do have your freshwater drain uh down bottom here and then you've got your uh your it's actually got two gray tank um drops in it so there's one here and one towards the back so we'll just walk on down the back here here's your other uh fresh water dump here and then you do have your uh your satellite get him off of there your satellite cable connections there now i went ahead and upgraded my my power connection here to the to the smart plug and so the sorry the the uh the smart plug just gives better electrical transfer than just a standard twist lock plug it's something that we totally believe in so when i get an rv of course you know i like to go to do my upgrades and the smart plug is a excellent upgrade i do have a video of me doing the install on it if you want to check that out but again it's it's easy to uh just pop it pull out push back in it's got these pins on the side that you can hear that it's clamped down a little light there to show we have power and uh and again much better electric electrical transfer because the pins on the smart plug are much thicker than those regularly twisted twist style plugs so i'm super pleased with getting that on this rig as well all right we're gonna get up on this roof but before i do i forgot one thing the subfloor 5 8 inch uh plywood all right so more about the solid construction of this unit and so let's get up on the roof i'll just kind of tell you a little bit about what's up there all right just a couple of things about up here it does have two uh of the max air roof vents here this is my 15 000 btu air conditioner now you got a couple of roof vents your tv antenna it does have the wi-fi ranger wi-fi booster built onto this unit which is kind of cool and then i do have one solar panel up here and so uh it it comes pre-wired with a solar panel and then it's the upgrade just to get the solar panel if you want it so not not much else to see up here but at least one to point it out so we've been real excited to have uh this unit something a little smaller than we're normally used to and uh but it's allowed us to do uh you know some quick trips uh here and there and we've just really enjoyed the the more compact nature of it as uh as we've traveled in it and so i'm super excited about all the construction stuff i was talking to you about and i hope this video was helpful on that now i'm going to do another video that is going to do a tour of the inside and you most likely won't want to miss that if you're interested in one of these rockwood

{"id": "etEUm4zCGIw", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "HwjX8ey_WFK6b8FoW4plu1DtBjs", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and in this video i want to show you how to make the connections of your hoses to your vay air now this video will apply to if you have a vayer 450 or a 400 so you've got your main unit here and then you're going to have two air hoses both of them are 30 feet each you're going to have a 40 inch extended chuck the gas station style air gun and then you're going to have a 45 degree chuck for those inside dual tires that'll make it real easy so i want to show you kind of how to piece all this together to make sure you're you're doing this right so on your hoses on the collar of the hoses one hose will say primary hose and then the other one will say extended hose the primary hose is always the hose that's going to connect directly to the by air unit so remember that primary hose always going to go here so it's a quick connect so you're just going to pull the collar back like that push it on the unit and then release the collar now if that collar doesn't release all the way then you don't have a good connection you might have a leak so make sure you pull it back push it in all the way and then release it okay and that's your primary host if you need more than 30 feet then you would add the extension hose if you don't need more than 30 feet in your particular application then you don't have to use this but if you did need to use the extension hose then you're just going to take the end of the other end of your primary hose and connect it with the quick disconnect kind of the same concept to the extension hose so remember pull the collar back push in push the collar in okay and then you're good to go all right so i'm going to do the rest of this without the extension hose because basically the other end of the extension hose even though it looks a little bit different than this they're basically the same thing a quick disconnect all right so the first thing that i want to do once i've connected this let's do the scenario where i'm going to use the gas station style air gun so same concept you're going to take this and you're going to pull the collar back push and then make sure that collar snaps back forward again this is kind of the crucial part if you don't get that right you could have some leaking if it snaps in place you're going to be all good so now i've got 30 feet here with my primary hose with my gas station style air gun and i love the 40 inch extended chuck here because this is going to allow me to stand up while i air up my tires and i sort of have to be on my knees the whole time right so same concept you've got your 40 inch extended chuck and again we've got a quick collar a connect collar here you're going to push in and then make sure that that is all sealed now you're pretty much done at this point so from here i could go down screw this on to the valve stem wherever that's at and then i can just stand up and uh and air my tire up so that's sort of the beauty of having that and this only comes on the newest style of viers which is is the rvs version the rv version with without the s on it that you might see out on the internet are not the newest models and they do not have this 40 inch extended chuck which is worth the price of the unit to me okay so we've got that done now what i want to do is i want to to uh to put on the 45 degree chuck here that's good for dual tires all right now you're going to have an adapter piece here and you'll need to screw that adapter piece into the 45 degree chuck you want to make sure it's screwed in pretty good i'm not going to do the whole thing right now as far as tightening it but you get the point make sure that's in there good and then basically what you're going to do from here is you can then just put it into the gas station style gun again pull the collar back push it in make sure it snaps and then and then you're good to go right so really sort of uh nothing to it you just gotta really make sure that your quick connects are fully engaged and that the collar fully snaps forward and if you do that on all of your connection points then you're not going to have any problems with any leaking at those particular connection points all right that does it that is how you connect the hoses on the 400 rvs and the 450 rvs so if you don't already have a unit then you can get these rvs models at technorv.com and if you have any questions about these units you can call us chat with us or email us we're always happy to help", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2021-05-11T22:22:22Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "Connecting the Hoses on a VIAIR 400P-RVS and the VIAIR 450P-RVS", "description": "There are 4 models of VIAIR RVS units and each is specifically designed for different RV models.

{"id": "GZMf8ZOxjdw", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "lNPuyFO1TF6miesc7SI7y8F3ayg", "transcript": "hey this is eric and tammy over at techno rv and because of our business techno rv we're very fortunate to have access to a lot of experts in the industry as it relates to a lot of the products that we sell and today we're fortunate to have mike conway from southwire with us welcome mike thanks eric thanks for and tammy thanks for having me so what we thought we would do is uh southwire is uh the search guard uh people here and we personally have used the surge guard products for so many years on our rv it is the product that we 100 believe in to protect our rv and we just get a lot of questions about uh the the units and just about rv electricity in general so we thought we would just take this time with mike and just have a discussion about many topics that we have that get brought up to us so where do we want to start well let's start at the very basic level here um we get questions from new rvers that are 30 amp versus 50m which one did i get maybe at the dealer they don't even know what they got was a 30 amp 50 amp rb so purchasing the right equipment for it you know you have to know 30 amp versus 50 yeah so easiest way for a customer for you as an rver to know is go out to your power cord and take a look at the power cord so this card here has three prongs on it this is what's gonna plug in to the outlet uh where you plug in and this is a 30 amp so a 30 amp only has three prongs easiest way to remember it's also substantially smaller a 50 amp has four prongs so you're gonna have um rather than three you're gonna have four here and so you actually have two legs rather than just one leg of power okay so if somebody's wanting to know how to tell the like the easiest way is is just okay three three three three prongs is 30 amp and and four prongs is 50 amp but absolutely uh so let's dig into that a little bit more uh on a 30 amp uh rv you you have uh one uh hot leg 120 volt hot leg coming in then you have a ground and a neutral and then on a 50 amp the reason it has four prongs here is that you have two hot legs coming in so that's 220 uh volt legs coming into your rv and uh and then you have the neutral amp and the ground right correct yep that's that's 100 correct so when you look at 30 amp versus 50 amp it's not just 20 amps difference right it's actually more than that because of the two legs and so on a 50 amp you actually have leg 1 at 50 amps and you have leg 2 at 50 amps so a total a 50 amp rv actually is going to draw 100 amps power so you're going to have three times the amount of power on a 50 amp versus a 30. and so that's why your power cord is going to be substantially larger it's going to be bigger plugs the breakers on the side are going to be larger because of the the current that can flow through that rv okay so there's a a simple formula i'd like to to point out maybe tammy can put this on the screen right now can you do that i can do that okay back to sort of i guess uh seventh grade science and uh it's volts times amps equals watts so on the volt side for that formula we can always just assume it's 120 volts sure you might be a little higher a little lower than that but for the purposes of this let's just say it's 120 and then if you're in a 30 amp rig so volts times amp so it would be 120 times the 30 amp that your rig is and that equals 3 600 watts okay of available power that you have to use and so to mike's point if you take that same formula and you say okay now i'm in a 50 amp rig so uh it's it's 120 volts but it's 120 volts times two then times 50 and so that is actually 000 watts so by gold so to mike's point you're not just going from 30 to 50 amps and getting like 3 600 to maybe 6 000 you're going from 3 600 available watts in a 30 amp rv to 12 000 available watts in a 50 amp rv and that's why 50 amps have three ac units a lot of times and 30 amps only have one absolutely absolutely so uh if you think about you know the uh in terms of wattage the uh a lot of people can maybe relate to like they have a hair dryer and it's got like yeah i think yours has like i know i know i never cared how many watts my hair was until we moved to an rv like 1800 watt are you crazy you need to go get a hairdryer things it's like it's like a blowtorch this thing you know and uh so so it says 1800 watts on the side and so uh now that means something to us as an rv for you you watching if you're an rv it should mean something to you now because if i'm in a 30 amp rig and uh and i'm i'm running that 1800 watt uh blow dryer and i can and i only have 3 600 available watts yep you know then you know i got to think about like if i turn that microwave on or i've got my ac unit on so these are the considerations we have to to make right absolutely absolutely on a 30 amp it's very critical that you are aware of the loads you're running and you know i like the analogy of in the morning right you got to have i got to have my coffee i i can't get going without rotting so you got to run that coffee pot you're going to be running a shower hot water is being used this time of year down south ac is running yeah right well here we have a problem because with all of those loads i can't run the microwave to make my breakfast yeah i can't run the hair dryer when my wife gets out of the shower so we have you have to be aware of the loads and be able to manage that but you don't use a hair dryer uh not normally not normally but maybe not the 1800 watt one yeah yeah no normally just the exhaust fan in the bathroom works so uh so yeah so i guess that answers the question of uh the difference in the 30 and 50 amp and uh and the considerations that you need to make uh depending on which which rv so 30 amp rv always gets the 30 amp surge protector 50 amp rv always gets the 50 amp but how do you what if we're 50 amp and we want to go plug into a 30 amp because we're at an older park that doesn't even have 50 amp yet yeah that's a great question tammy so anytime you have a rig such as your rig here this tiffin it's a 50 amp rig you always get the surge protector to match your rv so get the surge guard to match and so you know for you it's going to be a 50 amp and if you're in an older park or in a park that only has 30 amp access you're going to go ahead and use an adapter and so you can absolutely adapt in a pedestal with any of the surge guard products so if i have a 50 amp and i'm going to plug into a 30 you're going to use a 50 amp to a 30 amp dog bone adapter and so the way that would look is just like it is here and then you plug this into that pedestal with your coach plugged in on the output side okay so if uh so in a 50 amp rig i've got i've got two hot lines coming in and and i know that usually they'll split those on on both sides of the rv and that the manufacturer will appropriate certain receptacles for one side and certain ac units for the different sides uh so if the 30 amp uh only has one hot leg does that mean that whenever i adapt that only one side of my rv gets lit up or do both sides get lit up so that's where it's important you're using a quality adapter such as the south wire adapters so if you're using a quality adapter it's going to power both legs and it's all going to be ran through the wiring and into the mold and so if you end up using a cheaper less expensive adapter those can sometimes have problems where you don't get power on both legs and so it's important again that you pay for a quality item um when you're adapting these are something that wear out over time and you do want to make sure you keep them nice and clean don't let debris get on the plugs and once they start wearing out replace them so the hot leg from the 30 amp here yep gets split down here correct to these two right right that's and that's how it can continue to go into the 50 amp correct and so your 50 amp rv is still getting power on both legs however you don't have 50 amps to run well why not so because you're adapted down to a 30 amp all you can run is a total of 30 amps if you draw more than 30 amps you're going to have over current draw from the pedestal from the pedestal and so that pedestal that breaker on the pedestal should trip somewhere around 33 to 36 amps and when that trips that's a safety mechanism to prevent a thermal event you do not want that breaker to be the reason why you keep disconnecting power you need to manage your loads and you need to be aware of what's going on and that's where you know the surge guard units with the bluetooth remote is key because you can monitor your voltage and your amp draw real time inside your rig with a guaranteed 100 foot range absolutely i know when we're plugged into 30 amp it's you sit there you're watching it and i'm like okay what all can i cook with tonight what can i do turn the air off turn the electric water heater off what have i got and we'll do tests on what we can run when we're just on 30 amps she's got all her kitchen gadgets right and they're all they're all they're all heat producing type items which and we're all electric coach so you can't even pull propane out to use but but having the adapter and we'll we'll talk a little bit more about the adapter here in a second or the the monitor display that displays uh what we're talking about here is it tells you how many volts your your uh you've got coming to your rv from the pedestal and it tells you how many amps you're drawing right so uh if you're in a 30 amp rig you don't need to be pulling more than 30 amps so so we can watch that if we're on a pedestal and we're a 30 amp pedestal in our 50 amp rv then we make sure that we keep it to an appropriate level but is it safe for say somebody like me that's watching it because you said the breaker will trip at about what 30 yeah between 33 and 36 depending on how strong of a breaker it is but when that trips it's not because of a current threshold it's because of a heat build up okay and so once it trips the first time the next time it's going to trip even quicker and the next one and so the breaker will wear out over time you do not want that breaker to be your safety mechanism you want to be able to monitor and pay attention to your loads especially when you're adapting again going from a 50 amp rig you're used to running two acs being able to cook run the air fryer coffee pot no problem right on a 30 amp when you're with that you're going to be needing to make sure you manage your loads very carefully just because you could get more amps you shouldn't so i guess that's my question uh so it because to your point it's gonna the breaker will trip beyond 30 amps so should i just run can i send if i'm watching it i know how many amps i'm pulling why can't i just continue to run 32 amps that i mean that doesn't sound like something i should be doing though right you shouldn't be doing that because the rigs are designed your rvs are designed to only handle 30 amps there's a safety mechanism there to where it's over engineered able to hand about a 10 percent more demand however you're building up heat you're you're overloading and so at your main load center inside your panel the wiring your adapter plug you notice your 50 amp plug cord is much thicker than what your adapter cord is and so you're putting a lot of stress on a part that's not designed to handle that amount of current makes sense so let's let's reverse this situation let's say i'm in a 30 amp rig yeah and i've got my 30 amp uh surge guard unit here yep but i only have availability to a 50 amp pedestal uh so i can adapt there too right absolutely yeah so you'd take a 30 amp to a 50 amp male adapter and you plug in just like you did on the 50 amp to 30 buck reverse and plug it right in now the thing to know is on a 30 amp rig now you don't have the safety mechanism of that breaker tripping and so if you over draw and you get to 36 38 40 amps without a surge guard full electrical protection device you are running the risk of having a thermal event because the wiring inside your coach the wiring going to the pedestal is not designed to handle that type of current so the shore cord can't handle that current okay inside your rig you do have a breaker you have a 30 amp main breaker again that breaker is not supposed to be put to the test as your safety mechanism for when you're adapting to 50 amp it's a fail safe but they can malfunction so on surge guard one of the things we've done is on a 30 amp product there's over current protection so if we see you drawing 20 percent demand or 120 percent demand sorry which would be 36 amps we're going to go ahead and shut you down and say over current protection because we don't want your rv to have a thermal event we don't want your weekend away ruined because of all you could do was adapt to a 50 amp plug and you're over drawing just not being away okay so i was getting all excited i thought if i was in a 30 amp rig and could go to a 15 peso i just had all the power i wanted but but that's not the case right that's not the case no and and so even though you plug into a 50 amp you still need to be aware of your loads and monitoring your loads so let me see this here real quick so okay so now let me think about this because i've got two hot legs coming out of here right and then but that down here i've only got one so is one of these just a dummy plug and it's only pulling from one of these to come down here yeah so you're only having one so it's pulling off leg one okay so if i if i uh and i'm not gonna do it because it's so well built i probably wouldn't be able to do it but uh if i wanted to cut this thing apart one of these is is not even connected to down here right this wire here is a three conductor wire so you have a leg one a neutral and a ground got it okay all insulated wiring there okay and what are what's that for that's an easy pull handle so this is a patented technology that southwire has so that with all of our cords and adapters you can plug into any pedestal and fold the handle flat okay so you can still close the cover so i wanted to bring that up because uh you know it seems like oh it's it's is that really necessary or whatever but uh in my years of of rving because i have uh used cords before that didn't have something like that and and uh you know depending on the pedestal that you're at or how long it's been plugged in you know get a little aggressive yeah having to grab this like this and try and pull it apart can sometimes be a mess but having this especially uh if because the the genius part of this is i know is this uh of course has it has it too right so if i'm pulling this uh out of the pedestal i can just place my hand on the pedestal pull it out after i've turned the breaker off of course of course yep and then they've got one on the back here because a lot of times if i'm staying somewhere for a long period of time and i have this in here just like with anything i mean you leave something plugged in long enough it might be a little more difficult to pull out and so now i can have a plug on this end and this end and i can pop them out very easily rocking them back and forth and loosening it all up and everything absolutely and one of the cool things with our products you're going to notice on the full electrical protection units they have an integrated receptacle inside rather than a plug head and the reason why we did that is you get 50 percent more brass contact which to normal everyday campers you don't understand what that means as we said earlier these wear out over time a plug head because of how they're molded and the brass they can only hold their shape for so long and they become deformed and you get loose connections inside of a commercial grade receptacle you don't have that problem any longer and so longevity of the product is key and that's why we offer that lifetime warranty and the connected equipment coverage something you can't do if all you're doing is a just a normal plug head interesting okay i didn't know that yeah because i see i've i've seen uh and we're not here to talk about competitors but i have seen other units on the market or even plugs yeah that uh that don't have molded so that's interesting i like i like that absolutely um all right so uh why don't we move on to another topic okay a common thing you read about in social media groups uh is low voltage is what you need to worry about low voltage and campgrounds and coming from a house you know you don't ever stop to think about low voltage much i guess so the question is what is the big deal about low voltage and why are campgrounds so susceptible to it yeah great question so let's start out by saying it's nothing that the campground is doing purposely wrong inherently wrong it actually goes back to the code and so you know when you have a home you have a subdivision it's built to a code it's built to a standard and so there's a demand factor that every subdivision is built to rv parks are held to that same demand factor so when i build a rv park and i build an rv spot that has 10 campsites at it i don't need to provide a hundred percent demand to each location once i get to 10 spots i only have to provide 50 percent demand in order to be code compliant and so if you know those 10 spots are 50 amp rvs we already talked 50 amp rvs actually draw 100 amps power so instead of 10 campsites at 100 amps power 1000 total amps i only have to have an infrastructure of 500 available amps and so what happens is once you hit that threshold of amps 500 your voltage of 120 is going to degrade so it's going to decrease and so when i get to a 550 amp you're going to get lower voltage when i get to 600 amps i'm going to get even lower and so campgrounds as we all know campgrounds are not at 50 percent capacity no they certainly aren't they're you know 100 amp hogs yeah and so it all goes back to the demand factor that that our campgrounds are built to um just isn't adequate um and so again campgrounds aren't doing anything inherently wrong it's it's a code and so as a infrastructure planner as an investor of a campground why would i if code says i only need to have 50 capacity or if i end up getting 20 sites i only need 40 capacity why would i spend two three times the cost to have 100 or 75 percent capacity and so that coupled with a lot of the older parks originally only had 30 amp rvs they have since upgraded and even the great ones have upgraded when they upgrade to 50 amp they run new lines they run put in brand new pedestals they don't just add a receptacle and a breaker and daisy chain they actually go through and tear apart the campground re do everything the problem is if that transformer isn't upgraded at the same time you're setting yourself up for for a nightmare of a problem because you're going from 30 amps to 100 amps demand at each spot potentially and so the overload on on the grid is a problem i feel like this is breaking news i am i am blown away by the fact that the code says that they don't have to build their system uh to meet a hundred percent demand because every park we've gone well not everyone but what about a gym if you join a gym they they don't have to do it either they don't have to be able to sign a thousand people up because they only know 50 people a day are going to show up it's the same concept but at an rv park you feel like if i pay you 35 dollars for this site overnight i should get all 100 amps that i want so at my leisure and i will say that that in all the places we've been and we've we've been fortunate enough to have this rv in 49 states it is the number one thing that we have experienced is low voltage um and i guess now i know why right because the way that the parks are built they're setting themselves up for failure from the beginning and low voltage let's just let's just get into that not why we have a low voltage but you know sort of uh you know why it's a problem and the the the sensitive electronics in your rv are not designed to run on low voltage and a lot of times uh you know i'll hear somebody say like on a social media group or something of you know i've been rving for you know 50 years and and never had a problem yeah so my problem with that is with low voltage there's not an immediate cause and effect usually usually you could you could run low voltage and things would run but components electronics that are run on low voltage for a period of time it will reduce the life of those things so then you wake up one morning and a piece of your electronics isn't working and you just think well it just died could have been from low voltage easily right absolutely absolutely and and let's talk about low voltage you know what is low voltage what is high voltage so it's nothing that eric you come up with right it's nothing i come up with with southwire it's actually the nec code so north american electric code dictates that low voltage is it is below 103 volt so 102 and below is low voltage high voltage is anything above 132. so 133 volts and higher is high voltage and so that is a code um that states what what voltage is it's not an arbitrary thing and so low voltage when you get outside that 102 10103 and below you end up degrading the electronics over time as you said in the range of you know 95 to 102 you're not going to see instantaneous damage most of the time it's going to just be harder on those components and degrade those electronics over time you know when we look at your rv whether it's this or your travel trailer teardrop trailer any of the rvs our oems build quality products and the components that we as suppliers provide those oems are built to be robust and last and so when someone has a refrigerator that they have to replace three years in or in new ac unit five years in that shouldn't happen just like at your home when you buy an appliance that appliance is supposed to last time right so an air conditioner at home supposed to last you 20 years approximately depending on where you live your rv's the same way yeah that air conditioner should not be having to be replaced if it's having to be replaced more than likely it was due to a voltage problem over time i mean again i feel like that people watching this that are that go to rv parks and have had because a lot of people that we talked to they certainly had things in their rv to sort of go out on them and need to replace things whether it's ac units or a microwave or refrigerator and things like this so i know we're you know we're just talking about low voltage here but there's a lot of things that can actually go go wrong when you decide to plug your rv into a rv park uh pedestal and uh and there are things that you can do to protect yourself from these type things and uh mainly these these surge guards so why don't we just uh if you would just walk us through what are the things that you know can happen at an rv park pedestal and how these help protect yeah absolutely so it's not just rv parks but even at home you put in a new pedestal at your house you hire an electrician an electrician who comes out to put in a 30 amp they know hey this is a 30 amp but inside a home it's 240 volt it's for that dryer and so when they put that pedestal in a lot of times they'll miswire that instead of 120 volts to 240 volts and so that would fry your electronics in the rv very quickly if you plugged into that um that can happen at a park as well you know what else happens at a park is that pedestal you know that outlet here could be have a loose connection yeah could have reverse polarity which is where you know you're hot and neutral are flipped um and and so reverse polarity in and of itself on a rv that that hasn't been altered from the factory there's not an inherent danger there yeah but it's appliances you plug in still could have power to them it's other things that could happen and so reverse polarity can be dangerous so so so what you're saying is is uh on the reverse polarity you're saying i could be plugged into a wall outlet that the the neutral and the hot wire are swapped yup and that appliance is off but because it's reverse polarity it could still be hot correct correct okay that sounds dangerous it does yeah yeah and again reverse polarity can be problematic yeah um you know especially if we won't get into too much technical but but there's other things that could happen inside sure um if you're if your rv is being serviced by a untrained rv technician yeah um besides reverse polarity uh something that's even more dangerous is going to be an open ground okay so so your open ground is your return path for voltage back to ground so on an rv rvs are built with metal you have a metal chassis you have metal on the outside of the rv and if you don't have a return path for ground you have the potential to be shocked when you touch something metal and so an open ground condition according to ul you know the the underwriter laboratory code you are not allowed to break ground you can never disconnect the ground okay and so the reason for that is if i have stray voltage which every electrical device known to man has leakage normally in milliamps that that leakage goes to ground but you can also have voltage due to you know a wire um the the jacketing chafing through and touching hot skin you could have a lot of variables there where you get leakage or voltage onto ground and if you don't have that return path to ground you go and touch something metal you have what's called a hot skin condition okay and that can be very hazardous so so so power uh it it has to go somewhere right i mean it comes in it it performs its operation in your rv but if you have excess voltage uh more than what's needed to perform the functions in the rv that excess voltage is what's going to ground is that right well so it could be but you could also have just um you know the uh what's called leakage where you're having stray voltage off the electrical device um going to ground but so excess voltage if you don't have ground it's going somewhere yeah it's staying on that metal platform because it can't escape right and so without that ground there there's a problem so now it could my whole rv's charge at that point it could be yes okay yep and we've had open ground in our in situations where they came and we just moved pedestals well that's a good point if you if you uh uh get to an rv site and you did have an open ground condition because mike's going to talk a little bit about these these surge guards they will actually tell you if you have open ground and we've we've had that and let someone know and we let somebody know they move us to another site or get an electrician come out and fix it immediately yeah that's the solution that's not you don't plug into that yeah it's not don't use it yeah plug it in anyway no exactly exactly no and the the other thing that could happen is a open neutral condition on a 30 amp if you have an open neutral you're just not going to have power you're not going to get power into the coach you need a neutral on a 30 amp on a 50 amp rig you know it shares that neutral between leg 1 and leg 2 this is shared and so if you lose this neutral you end up creating a 240 volt loop where you get high voltage on one leg low voltage on another and it's going to damage your electronics pretty quickly in that rig just like on a 30 amp if you plug that 30 amp into a 240 volt outlet stuff would get damaged in your rig same thing with an open neutral on a 50 amp so it's a big deal and so besides that and besides voltage you know you could potentially have a frequency problem not so much in the states or up in canada it's when you're operating off of one of those big industrial generators you know they put in for a rock concert type deal or an rv show or an rv show yeah yeah yeah no and and it happens and so frequency is um the wave cycles so ac voltage which is what we're talking about when you plug in is ac voltage operates on a wave cycle and so it's like a roller coaster it goes up and down up and down and so in a second you have 60 of those wave cycles so it's 60 hertz it's called um and so if you get outside of 10 of that plus or minus 10 percent you will end up having problems with your electrons they won't run properly and so or it can damage them and and so we protect against that as well with our units you know um from a feature standpoint our products are very feature rich you know and that's why you guys love the product so much our our unit the best thing to do is get a full electrical protection device and the reason for that is not only are you protected from everything we just talked about but you're also protected from surges and high and low voltage which high and low voltage is the number one issue out in campgrounds as you guys can attest to it so let me stop you there absolutely the things that would so we talked about reverse polarity yeah open neutral uh open ground yeah so so you're saying that that protects us against so does that mean that that it just fixes those problems how does it how does it protect it yeah so this is a computer inside here and so this when you plug it in it's going to be analyzing the power source what you're plugged into and so it's a 10 second startup sequence during that 10 seconds if we see one of those problems right on this screen it will tell you what that problem is plain english so you don't have to be a rocket scientist you don't have to look for a decoding book right it tells you open neutral and it doesn't let the power through and it doesn't let power through yep and i and i love the the the plain language on there because when we've had it before uh you know i know that that uh i've seen units that have like codes on them and you have to you know look up up the code uh but this just says like open ground right and and in an instant you you you know what's going on okay so it doesn't fix the problem it just said that it's your job to say hey this just told me that's a problem i need to contact the park and get them to address this correct correct so the way i like to do it is when i come to a campground before i back my rig in or pull my rig in or or start the setup process i grab my surge guard and i go to that pedestal i plug it in turn on that breaker wait that 10 seconds to see everything and it's going to tell me what my voltage is it's going to tell me everything and if i plug in and i already have low voltage or i already have a problem don't pull your rv in there please yeah please please please go to the the manager get a different site you do not want to take that power source okay um there's a reason why it's protecting you it's not to aggravate you it's to protect what you value most right and so that's what southwire is about is protecting what you value most which is hopefully you your family your pets and one of your largest investments which is your rv so all right it runs the 10 second analysis yep and let's say everything's good so uh i hear a little little thunk in there and that's yeah he's happy in the rv tammy's happy conditioner and it only takes 10 seconds which is spectacular yeah because if it was any longer then then that can seem like forever it does but 10 10 seconds that's nothing and so then it gives me power uh now what's it doing yeah so now it's going to continue to monitor just because we engage power doesn't mean you're oh you're good for ever you know some people have this misnomer well i don't want to spend that money because i can go out and test the pedestal with a volt meter or a cheap display and and see what's going on before i plug in we're constantly monitoring from the time you plug in and apply power to the time you disconnect power and leave and not just what you're plugged into here but what you're connecting so we sense on our 50 amp unit we sense your your rig and if you have open neutral condition inside your rig we sense that we disconnect power also inside the rv yeah going from the plug to inside the rv that shared neutral if you end up having a loose connection it's a patented technology that southwire has we sense that we disconnect power and is that is that the uh is that the load side protection is that what we call that yep that's load side open neutral so so line side protection is everything coming from the pedestal yep load side is inside the rv correct correct and then we also have one other awesome technology which is elevated ground protection and that's both on 50 amp and on our 30 amp unit and if you have elevated ground where you get 30 volts or higher on ground we sense that we disconnect power the reason why 30 volts is important is at 30 volts hot skin condition touch metal where you get where you get shocked 30 volts at 60 hertz which is that frequency we talked about that is where it becomes hazardous to human health okay and can not just shock but could electrocute you okay you don't need you don't need 120 volts to electrocute yeah so okay so we got we got that covered now the high and low voltage yep uh this is going to disconnect me right absolutely so let's let's deal with low voltage first you know i'm i'm in a park everyone it's the afternoon right it's four o'clock all the acs i got all three acs on and i'm at high demand and i'm hovering right at 103. you dip down because it it starts up the compressor it ends up dipping down to 99 volts and it comes back to 103 within an eight second window we're not going to disconnect okay but if you stay in low voltage for over eight seconds we're going to disconnect power yes when we automatically disconnect power we're going to continue to watch when power does come back to acceptable range we will start 128 second countdown once that 128 seconds is up and there hasn't been another issue during that time we will automatically reengage so it's not doing this on off on no no and so if it disconnects and it's been five ten minutes and this countdown timer goes down to 30 and then you know you look back and two minutes later it's back up to 96 seconds it's because we keep seeing voltage dipping down a fault uh and and so it's not we're not aggravating you on purpose we're trying to protect again you and one of your largest investments and the last thing we want is for you to for us to let bad power into your rig and not just you know ruin your rig but potentially cause you harm as well and so you know southwire we take great pride in our product we offer the industry's best warranty and that warranty with our product here is going to be not just a limited lifetime warranty but a connected equipment coverage and so connected equipment coverage means anything i plug in to here through my rv if we ever let that bad power into your rv and it not only takes out your ac your refrigerator your cpap machine you know your your electronics that you guys have right all of that gets damaged you're going to contact southwire and we're going to get your unit back we're going to analyze it with electricians inside our lab during that if it's found that our unit did not protect what we say we protect against you're going to provide us the receipts of everything that got damaged and so southwire will go ahead and cover that and so that's what separates us from anyone else in the marketplace is that guaranteed protection you know that no one else offers i think that says a lot because you're not going to offer that if you don't think your product can do it that would just be stupid absolutely absolutely and again who is southwire right and shame on me i should have said this earlier southwire is one of the largest wiring cable manufacturers in north america and so we are the industry leader in electrical protection as well we are the only full electrical supplier who provides both oems so your rv is built with southwire product inside and also providing full electrical protection in the aftermarket uh the warranty is is is madness like really i mean it's like i don't i can't think of any other company and any other product that that has a warranty like that so so that doesn't do what it was intended to do yep something in my rv gets damaged because it didn't do what it was intended to do you're gonna write me a chat yep so we again there's there's obviously all that fine print of course yeah but in in layman's terms yes so what's going to happen is we're going to again you're going to call us we want to work with you directly don't go back to your dealer don't go to bother you two you know contact southwire we're going to do an investigation on what happens you you know we do ask that you hold on to all that damaged product just discard it and so we get the unit back we take a look sure enough we had a manufacturing defect or it didn't function the way it was supposed to um we go ahead and work with you and get that covered and it is is is techno rv i i can say that in dealing with y'all for a lot of years that i i can't ever think of a time that that y'all haven't done what y'all said y'all were gonna do uh you know whether it be a warranty situation or taking care of a customer in a certain way so that's important to us because we're all about customer service and we only partner with companies that we feel share those same same values so uh no the easy sorry for interrupting the easiest job in the world is working for a privately held family-owned steel company that values their customers just like techno rv does that's what you were talking about i was like well thank you mike southwire values our customers and so we want customer satisfaction number one and we have we believe we have the very best product in the marketplace um to protect your rv and and protect what you value most i know you all have the best i i know that 100 um i've got another question but did you have one first or i did but you can go you sure okay uh all right we haven't really talked about surges themselves yeah we've gone through uh wiring issues high and low voltage but of course uh the the idea that you could could get a surge and your rv is still uh there what's what's this do how does it do it how do you get protected here yeah so whether you're talking full electrical protection surge protection or you're talking surge protection that you have for your tv you just went best buy and you bought yourself that brand new 75-inch tv right you put it in here right yeah put in here absolutely absolutely and with that best buy got you you ended up buying a search strip for that tv right the way all surge protection works is that we use mobs they're called metal oxidized baristas and the way those work is a surge is high energy in a very short duration and when i say short duration i'm not talking seconds i'm talking milliseconds microseconds and so that high energy that high voltage that comes through you know in a very short duration and those mobs what they do is they clamp down and so they they suck out that excess voltage okay that excess power and so every time they suck out that power they give up a little bit of their life okay okay and when at when they're at the end of their life they die and the way they die or they blow out and so they blow out in two different ways typically one is either out the bottom closest to the circuit board or two they'll crack on around the top and blow open kind of like butterfly wings and and i like electricity i like stuff like that and i find it pretty cool yeah seeing that but but the way our surge protection works is um it's a multi-stage surge protection what that means is we're not just you know stacking them vertically in a line right where one's getting hit all the time we also do in series so they're in series and in parallel okay and so it's a multi-stage surge suppression technology and um our units are designed to withstand a hundred six thousand volt surges without loss of function and features sounds like a lot that's why so exactly ul you know we we've been doing electrical protection for you know since the 90s and so in electrical protection ul tests it for 25 6000 volt surges and in those 25 if i have a unit that has led lights i have a screen i have anything you cannot fail you can't have a light blowout you can't 25 times just 25 times our products work 100 6000 volt surges without loss of function feature any damage is that uh and and i'm asking because i don't know is that like a would that be an industry-leading number it would be yeah so i mean 100 sounds like a lot we test everything we do to make sure we're the leader in the industry because you don't you don't become the most trusted electrical uh safety supplier to the oems by putting out marginal product okay so uh so i get a surge uh it's it's not a big one uh but but it's it's so it's not one and done you just keep using it right correct and that's a misnomer that's out there is people think i have a surge protector or one time it's hit i'm toast now there are what's called acts of god you know a direct lightning strike or or massive things that could happen where it takes out in one shot but but everything that might that's going to blow my tires off the ground exactly i mean there's going to be a lot more damage than that right and so our units are are designed to withstand hundreds of surges um without any issue and so a surge comes through you're not going to know it unless you don't have a surge strip or a surge guard connected to that device because it's going to damage that electronics you know i live in florida um and in florida i've had more electrical problems in the past six months than i have had my whole life in indiana yeah and so um i you know i'm a firm believer in electrical protection not just for rvs but for homes and everything because you know it's crazy that we spend hundreds thousands hundreds of thousands of dollars on things and we let a couple hundred dollars yeah dictate how how how much risk we want right and so a full electrical protection device is going to provide com comprehensive electrical protection whereas you know you walk into a store or see online you know go techno's site and you pull up another surge protector another surge guard unit but it's a third of the cost yeah the reason it's a third of the cost is it doesn't have a computer inside it doesn't provide full electrical protection it has indicators on there but it does have that surge strip still built for the whole rv right um and so that there is a misnomer that all electrical protection is the same it's not all the same by any means and so really understand what you have and and why why surge guard is the best to have so i'm not done with these surges yet i want to talk about them absolutely sorry i'm all over the place so so all right we've got these moths and they're taking hits and and so if i take a hit this big uh versus a hit this big let's say uh like this one might knock out a a half a mile but if it's a bigger one it potentially could knock out just a couple of mobs in there right i mean it's depending on the the the rating of the mobs and how big the spike is right and if i took uh direct hit it could just blow out all the miles yep okay and and remember over time they degrade right because they give up a little bit of their life every time they get hit and so um go on so so so we have a bank account you take a depo a withdrawal every time there's some type of search i love that analogy that's great we can just wrap things up right there yep thank you so so all you're talking about okay so uh now i i and by the way we've full-time rving for for six years so yeah so that this means for us that and we are typically on shore power that means 365 days a year uh 24 hours a day we are plugged in and we personally have never expired all the mobs in our unit um you know i'm not saying it can't happen because obviously it can happen but but i would say that it's it's not as common as some may think it does depend on where you're at in the country i guess but uh you know again i'm back to the low voltage is the thing that we experience more than anything but yep all right so let's get back to this so let's say i expend all my mobs um and and then and then and then what happens the red light comes on and then is is this you i just send it back to y'all and y'all repair it or what do we do from there yeah so when a mob when all the surge protection is used up it's depleted that excess energy it doesn't magically oh the mob no longer is there it no longer works and so now surges just magically disappear no that excess energy that took out that mauve is still going to be somewhere in the device or downstream now and it's going to cause damage and so inside the unit you have mobs but you also have circuit boards that have traces on them which are basically wires integrated into into the border right you have the processor and you have a contactor which has coils and so when i blow out those mobs that surge is still there and it has to go someplace so it's going to go to the next closest thing and damage that and so in our units you know we've been doing this since the 90s we've been doing electrical protection since the 90s and being a leader in the oem space with our electrical protection built in integrated into rvs we have seen where someone's taken surges and they've taken damage and the board on the unit we could replace you know and i get the board back and i change out the board for the customer only find out that you know their rig when they power it up it works for another month month and a half and then all of a sudden the coil gave out prematurely well why did that coil that coil that contactor is designed to withstand 10 000 disconnects before end of its life and then you know these types of circumstances what happens is that surge went through and damaged weaken that coil uh potentially in addition to that it could blow out the processor so when you exhaust surge protection or 30 years in this industry has taught us you need to change out buy another one buy another one it's a cheap investment again when i'm talking about this don't i don't want anyone to think several hundred dollars is is cheap it's not cheap it's an investment but compared to your rv even your ten thousand fifteen thousand dollar investment of a travel trailer to a hundreds of thousands of dollars for a class a diesel pusher this is a small investment and it did its job as its design get a new one and and of course i knew that before i asked the question but i still wanted them to talk to talk about it but yeah but uh and i agree with that 100 it's like hey that's it's it is an investment to buy one of these but if if it took that hit it did its job to protect your rv it's it's time to uh to to go get another one so uh but to just to clarify on the mob's thing yeah uh if if and i know that surge guard doesn't uh replace those or or anything like that but that's because if you take that surge uh and you let's say you did replace the mobs there there is likely or could be damage past that into the circuit board so now if you did replace that it would be like well but now the the circuit board may not identify open neutral anymore i mean who knows what it could be right yeah there can be potential damage inside the unit elsewhere and the last thing southwire wants is being an industry leader not just in the rv space but in the electrical space last thing we want is to attach our name to an inferior product right inferior situation and so we do not want to run the risk of having you or having us swap out broken components only to have you still aggravated because a unit failed prematurely down the road um we want satisfied customers for the lifetime i mean that's how you become the the industry leader in wiring cable and in electrical components well i mean again for us we've been six years we've never had to we've never had to replace ours yeah i mean we've we've changed model years and different things like that as as time goes on just because we're techno rv and we like to test the newest models and all that but 65 days a year 24 hours a day you know and and in 49 states i mean we've been in we've been at it all all right so i i know these these units are are well made yeah and so uh we do get asked the question sometimes just about uh the are they weatherproof waterproof like what's what's the rating on the like what can you can you and can't you do as it relates to weather yeah so uh weather you know again we've been doing electrical safety for 30 plus years we do not just rv but we do tfci the lc highs and so we know how to make a weatherproof unit and so with our units they're designed to be weatherproof weather resistant okay and what that means is that the unit can plug into a pedestal all day long 365 days a year without a blink of an eye what we don't want you doing is submerging the unit okay and so if i'm at a low pedestal i'm not just going to hang it and have it touch the ground right i'm going to put a block up underneath it to get it up off the ground and the reason for that is if you have it on the ground water is going to pool during the heavy rain we want to make sure water doesn't pool because if water pools it can penetrate the gaskets just like it can on your pressure washer machine yeah and so our units are designed to not let water moisture in got it what if we did let water in yep guess what our lifetime warranty limited lifetime warranty and connected equipment coverage covers moisture penetration so if five years down the road you get moisture back behind the screen or inside the unit you hear a swish swash of water that's covered it's covered as long as you didn't submerge the unit got it correct okay and i just wanted to point out and i may have already mentioned this but work we're hooked up 365 days a year 20 24 hours a day rain sleet snow sand storms wind storms like just everything we've been in a hurricane we've been in a hurricane and we've we've never had any issues with water penetration on these units but we do get asked the question so i'm glad we were able to uh discuss that you do put yours up on the little slinky even if we're some of these pedestals are so low to the ground even when the weather's good if we get to a low pedestal yeah you always put it up off the ground so you don't wait for the storm or the event to happen you're just like it's too low i'm gonna put it up if it's a low pedestal i'll just go ahead and put it up and i do use one of those sewer hose slinkies because they've kind of got this graduated sloping thing going on so that if i'm on a low pedestal you know even if it's bending like like that that slinky it's graduated from high to low so it can really just cradle that thing in there i mean a block would work too but uh but i found that that that slinky what is that what is this thing oh that's our integrated lock ring so this is designed to keep honest people honest okay and and make it so it doesn't get legs and walk away on it right and so all you do is you take your uh bike lock chain lock tie it to a pedestal and it makes it so that uh this isn't gonna get legs and walk away on it okay so that that's something another question we get asked people are concerned about you know is their theft you know i don't think there's this widespread uh theft issue of people coming and taking these off of pedestals but uh in the history of mankind i'm sure it's happened a few times uh but uh what i don't believe has ever happened that is if somebody has used the locking ring and had a cable lock wrapped around the pedestal like we do i would i would find it highly unlikely that uh a would-be thief would spend the time to try and deal with that one as opposed to just moving on to somebody else who doesn't have it locked up correct correct and that's that's what we've seen don't be an easy task exactly exactly inside our rv parks right we're a community and we're watching out for our neighbors and so you know if you see someone wandering between trailers that back by the back you're kind of curious as to what goes on oh yeah and so you know this again is a deterrent if someone wanted it they'd cut the cable off right yeah just like if someone wanted inside your rv they break the window out right it's a theft deterrent yeah yep so okay that that makes uh plenty of sense there uh so now i'm all right we've got the lcd uh display on these units and it absolutely it tells me how many volts i've got per line it tells me how many amps i'm pulling per line if i have any faults it's going to show up on here if i open neutral reverse polarity low voltage it's going to all show up out here uh so so my concern with that is that uh you know i wake up in the morning time and and uh walking around the rv in my underwear and and and and something and something happens like i don't want to go strolling outside to see what happened so what's the solution i shouldn't have to go out here and and look at this to see what's going on well as your neighbor i want to make sure you don't go out there okay and so that's why southwire has our remote okay so our units are 34931 which is a 30 amp and the 34 950 one are bluetooth certified and so we're the only one in the marketplace that has a bluetooth certified full electrical protection device okay and what that means is we went through the added steps and added efforts to have bluetooth independently test our protocol probably added expense too absolutely absolutely but we don't cut corners inside southwest right and so we came out with our bluetooth certified remote so on the remote you'll be able to see your voltage on each leg your amp draw your frequency and your kilowatts being used real time it also tells you your fault log as well so you can see you know the unit i have here tells you high and low voltage why that we've been disconnected from our surge guard unit and so this bluetooth remote we guarantee a hundred foot range okay reason why that's important is if all i had was my phone app guess what i'm dependent on at that point the hardware inside my phone and so depending on the phone depends on the range there are some phones you get 20 feet foot range there are other phones you get 50 feet 55 feet bluetooth range this is guaranteed for 100 foot range and so that's why we came out with our remote first before coming out with the app um and so we wanted to make sure that we checked all the boxes dotted all the eyes because we don't want to cut corners we don't want you to be frustrated when you're in the front of your rig and your power pedestal is back outside of your range of your phone we want to make sure you can see right just like i can take this off the bracket that's on the back and i can bring it outside i can carry it around with me a hundred foot range is a guarantee you know i've seen it work 200 feet 250 feet away without a problem so uh i love the wireless monitor and i the place that i normally sit in the rv i just have it right here so i can just reach over 30 amps tammy turn that hair dryer off [Laughter] so i love having the the information inside and i think most most uh customers do too okay so uh let's move on what's your next question oh okay so i have been talking to customers before and them asking questions and they will say oh but especially somebody at like the tampa show or the hershey show they come up they just bought a new rv they're so excited and they're like they told me it's got full surge protection in it i don't need this um so just explain what that means an rv coming from the manufacturer with surge protection what that could mean yeah do they all just have that or do they not no so so great question and it is something we get quite a lot right and so being the industry leader in electrical protection being the industry leader in transfer switches especially for the rvs you know we actually have one here a transfer switch from southwire um our transfer switches will say southwire or they'll say surge guard surge guard is the brand of our transfer switch it doesn't mean you have full electrical protection okay and so you really need to know what your part number is and so on our unit say i'll have a model number right here on the label and so on on the unit you need to understand that and you can go to our website and see what protection you have inside your rig but depending on the manufacturer if they have a a full electrical protection that's typically going to be the 404 500 for a 50 amp 403 5.0 for a 30 amp or a 40350 for a 50 amp we have a lot of them those are full electrical protection built into the rig so if you if you had to say take everything from pop-up campers all the way up to the the two three million dollar rvs what percentage of as a whole of all the rvs being sold would you say actually come with full protection yeah so you're under 10 percent of all rvs have even surge protection so again as we've talked about there's a difference in levels of protection there's full electrical protection which are these are the transfer switch that that has that full there's also what's called surge protection or electrical protection that is very limited in what it does and so that surge protection those those surge only devices that are 100 150 200 you know kind of that under 200 threshold those are a surge only with wiring diagnostics and so um it's a surge strip for your rv yeah there are some transfer switches and some hardwired units that are the same thing integrated into the rv where it it's a surge strip for the rv full electrical protection is really what every rv needs because again even that five thousand dollar pop-up camper still has electronics and you're plugging things into your rig and all it takes if you have one ac you need to protect it from low voltage you need to protect the unit if if inside your rv you know it's a temp pop-up where literally there's no electronics or it's all dc powered then obviously you don't need one but other than that you need you need to make sure you have full electrical plugging into something you need it absolutely yes sir okay so that kind of answered my question but there are other types of surge protectors that are built in or hardwired into rvs and maybe that could be what they're talking about aftermarket stuff aftermarket and oe actually so so in order to be an oem it has to be a ul listed product the ulc ul listed and so really there's only a couple of us who manufacture a hardwired unit to that level you know you guys carry our 34 uh i'm sorry 35550 yes for 50 amp and 30 355 30 amp those two units are hardwired full electrical protection units inside the rv as well they have optional remote panels for that unit and i highly recommend anyone who does a hardwired unit definitely spend the money for the remote kit you need to see what's going on inside your unit and again you get full electrical protection with our unit you still get that limited lifetime warranty and that connected equipment coverage that you won't get with anyone else's so again yes hardwired units is another form of full electrical protection that they could have okay yeah so i think we're about done and and you know i knew a good deal about this but i learned a lot today too yeah and and so it's always good to talk to the experts yes it's all that excellent uh point there and so uh so i did just want to point out that you know all this the surge guard stuff you can find it at our website at technrv.com and we are happy to answer more questions if you have them we have a very educated uh staff and customer support well it's just kind of our thing and so feel free to go to our website for more information there and i just wanted to say thanks to mike conway for coming out absolutely thank you guys for having me again we love the partnership with techno rv and your education piece again you guys do a phenomenal job helping us as an industry be able to educate anyone who's new and enjoying this wonderful lifestyle yeah okay all right thanks for checking us out and we'll see you down the road", "snippet": {"publishedAt":

{"id": "Hz_Tzbcs0ns", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "cqPKqi-_caXu9dWh1yVF-AhWsl0", "transcript": "in this video i'm going to show you how to enter a destination or start a route there are a lot of ways to do it but they all start from the where to as you can see you can choose it based on a lot of different categories we're going to start with the the most common one which is just entering an address into the search bar so i'm going to click the search bar if you are entering the address i'm going to enter my childhood address you just write the whole address 5103 woodland drive baton rouge louisiana 70816 and search and it's going to find that for me 166 miles away i could cl select it i can either look at two different routes and select which one i would like or i could enter the address going through the address icon if i don't want to use the search bar i could do the address and it will walk me through it 510 woodland drive now it's not pulling up louisiana because up here in the top corner it's showing me the area it's searching it's searching alabama mississippi and florida for 513 woodland drive if you can't find yours on the list because it's in the wrong state you can also always click that icon enter the city or state i'm just going to put louisiana and now when it searches for 5103 woodland drive i get the one that's actually in baton rouge louisiana so those are two ways that you can search it you can basically go in and just hit the search bar and write the entire address city state zip everything no commas needed but just put the entire address that you have or you can go through the address and actually ask for what is the street name what is the you know numbers whatever so those are the two ways if you just want to enter an address another way to add a location or start a route is to go to one of the pre-loaded categories that's in the gps probably one of the more common is campgrounds now my campgrounds are showing me what's near me in mobile so if you choose campgrounds that's what's going to show naturally is what's around you in order to change the location for where you want to find a campground you have to hit that blue icon again and tell it do you want it in where you are now a different city or so forth let's say i'm going to go a different city and i want to see the campgrounds in tampa it's going to ask me which tampa tampa florida that's what i want to see campgrounds in so now i'm looking at campgrounds in tampa i can scroll through it choose the one i want they're numbered according to where they are on the map and then of course you just select i can either look at both routes i can look at the parking around them i can read a little bit of information about the campground it's going to tell me how far it would take me to get there i can call the campground and so forth or i can just hit go now i already have a route in there because i chose to go to a woodland drive happy days rv park on w kennedy boulevard in tampa florida please drive to highlighted route that x does not cancel my route i have to go into the three dots stop the route if you can't find a campground in the database you can always enter the address through the search bar like we did in an earlier video you would just go into the search bar put the entire address of the campground that they gave you and enter city state everything zip code and it will show up as well so there's two ways you could find it so let's go back now so where to let's go back to the where to we've looked at the address we've looked at campgrounds we've looked at the search bar there are a lot of other choices you have here and these are all categories to search and they work the same as the campgrounds for example there's specific koa there's national parks there's trip advisor type locations there are categories here that have all the rest areas and everything else you would want in a gps if i wanted say a rest area it's giving me the rest areas around me well let's say i'm driving i don't want the rest areas just around me i want it upcoming on my route you would choose rest areas like i did go back to the location device and choose my active route you can do this before you take off on your trip and kind of just gauge where you're going to be stopping what rest areas are on your route or you can be doing it while you're driving there is a quicker way to do it if you're actually driving but if you're planning your trip and you just want to see what is on your route how many rest areas how far apart are they this is a way to see how far 42 miles ahead 43 miles ahead and so forth on that short little trip i took to mississippi from alabama but if you're actually on your map and you're driving you can find rest areas and other things along your route really quickly by hitting the icon on the right hand side that shows upcoming services i guess on your along your road so i can see i have an exxon i have a welcome center in 43 miles and so forth i have some rv parks and 10 miles so the up ahead is really nice you can also select a destination using voice navigation while on the map screen to activate voice navigation you have to say a particular phrase once you say that phrase it's going to respond and then you clearly let the gps know what you're looking for okay garmin find me a campground in tampa florida which result near tampa florida would you like number two going to lazydays campground on county road 579 in seffner florida please drive to highlighted route so you can see that just by using that wake up phrase which if i say it now it will wake it up again but that phrase will activate a small box at the bottom that lets you know it's listening to you and you can clearly say very simply what it is you're looking for you can also tell it to turn volume up or turn volume down or increase brightness if you're not sure what you're looking for you can ask for locations around you okay garmin find me a cracker barrel which result would you like four at his next stop going to cracker barrel old country store on 13 in sarah land alabama okay garmin stop route okay root cancelled so you can see that the voice navigation is very easy to use it's very responsive you just have to learn how i guess how you have to ask it keep it simple um very straight to the point you can give it an entire address and it route you there if you speak the address correctly and completely okay garmin find a gas station which result would you like four going to circle k on tanner williams wrote in mobile alabama okay garmin when will i arrive you should arrive at 2 pm ok garmin stop route okay root cancelled you can change your wake up phrase it is automatically set as ok garmin exit you can also enter a destination by selecting it on the map so instead of going to the where to icon you would go to the view map icon you want to get your screen to where you can see where it is that you're trying to select and just scroll to wherever that just my orientation changes uh i'm in the middle of nowhere right now but let's say i want to go right here you hold the screen and touch it and it's going to give you the address of what you touched and i could hit go please drive to highlighted route so that's another way you could choose a location by just selecting a location on the map touching the map holding it down and when you release it it'll give you the address of where you touched and the option to navigate there again to stop a navigation three dots stop there may be times that the only thing you know about a location are the coordinates there are times at rv rallies they give you the coordinates to the gate that you need to enter maybe you're boondocking and there is a particular spot you like that is specific coordinates and that's all you have as a location you can enter a location based on the coordinates and that's on your options in the map section you can enter the coordinates and view where those locations are on your map and then save that location if you'd like and because it's coordinates it's going to ask you to name that coordinate so it could be entrance gate to the fmca rally or boondocking spot in albuquerque or wherever you may be so that's a neat way to save locations when all you may have are the coordinates or that the exact location of

{"id": "uhs-CGILWiE", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "jTQWc6x7mSwkQHMCien1a09LoTA", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and in this video i want to compare and contrast the vi air 300 and the vi air 400 these are the two units that we get the questions asked the most about which one's right for my particular rv there are four models of the vi air there's the 89 which is designed for class b's this 300 here is designed for towables the 400 here is designed for class cs and the 450 is designed for class ace so the simple part of this is that if you've got a class b you're getting the 89 if you're getting if you have a class a you're getting the 450. the gray area becomes the 300 and 400 because while the 300 is designed for towables there are some towables that i would really say you should just go ahead and get the 400 model so i want to just go through that with you and make sure that you're clear on this as you make your decision uh the first thing that i want to to point out here is that the 300 is not recommended for dual tires so this could be one where you've got a towel but you're towing it with a dually truck and it's like well if that's the case then i'll just go ahead and get the 400. so uh you know the the air hose on the 300 really just isn't suitable for dual tires in some scenarios whereas the 400 actually comes with the 45 degree extendable chuck that's designed for dual tires so keep that in mind that's one question you may want to ask yourself there the number the second thing i want to talk about is that the 300 comes with 30 feet of hose while the 400 comes with 60 feet of hose now i'm only showing 30 feet here but there is an additional 30 feet that comes with the 400 system so now let's talk about that for a little bit if i've got a 40 foot fifth wheel and i'm going to be connecting my uh 12 volt power uh here from my 300 to the batteries of my truck that's a pretty good haul to get back to the tires on a 40-footer i've even seen fifth wheels that are 45 foot but even so a travel trailer at 35 feet you just kind of need to think about that distance there and say hey is 30 feet enough now you can add an additional 30 feet to the 300 and it's about 40 bucks to do that so when when you're placing your order you're like hey i like everything about the 300 but i wish i had had more hose you can just add that to your order whereas with the 400 it just comes with 60 feet of hose so something to consider there the 300 comes with a inline gauge that goes up to 150 psi so it's kind of got this inflator deflator hose and that's your 30 foot hose and it's all kind of built into it whereas the 400 comes with this gas station style airing gun which i happen to really like and so this would connect to your air hose coming from your 400 in addition the 400 comes with this 40 inch extendable chuck here and it's really my favorite part about this whole compressor here because you can put this 40 inch extendable chuck into this air gun you can screw the chuck onto your valve stem and what this allows me to do is stand up while i'm airing up my tires as opposed to if i didn't have this i would have to be like down on my knees airing my tires up and uh for those of you that have a lot more youth in you than somebody like me may have that may not bother you but for me i certainly love this 40 inch extendable chuck so that i can stand up and then i just pull the trigger watch it air up and uh on the the gauge that comes on the gun i really like that so i wanted to point that out in addition you do as i mentioned before you do get the 45 degree extendable chuck for dually tires and so that is a great addition to the uh the system as well so uh before i move on i did want to point out that you know and i think it's a good time to point out because obviously you're getting a lot more like add-on tools with the uh 400 than you do the 300 there is a price difference in these two at the time of shooting this video there's about 150 price difference between these two models so as you're thinking this through you might be like hey the we're going to talk about performance in a little bit but hey the 300 is going to do the job as far as airing up your tires on any towable uh but if you want a few more of the fancy gadgets and that's worth it to you then you're gonna have to spend a little bit more money to move up to the the 400 model here another thing to point out is that vi air does have what's called a winterization kit so if you want to winterize your rv and blow out your air lines with your uh inflator your valor inflator you'll need a by ear winterization kit and that basically just helps you dial down the pressure that's being pushed through your lines that winterization kit does not work with the 300 but it does work with the 400 so again if you've got a towable but you're wanting to use this to also winter help winterize your rv then you got to go with the 400. so these are the questions you got to be asking yourself when making this decision let's talk about performance and they both pack a lot of it the 300 for any towable out there it's gonna do the job for you yes the 400 has more power uh but at the same time the 300's got enough to get the job done for any towable out there so the max tire size that the 300 is designed for is a 245 by 70 radial 19.5 rim so keep that in mind that's the max size according to the manufacturer so if i was going to air up a 33 inch tire and let's say i was doing this this 245 70 19.5 tire and by the way i don't want to get us all caught up in in the numbers though that those numbers mean something and they're that's what's on the side wall of uh of your tire i've got other videos that explain more in detail what all that that means but uh for the purposes of this i'm going to assume maybe you know what what i'm talking about here but it really is just talking about the size of the tire so for a 245 70 by 19.5 tire airing from 80 psi to 90 psi it takes this system right here 44 seconds to do that so that's getting the air to it pretty good uh this is rated up to 150 psi and has a 2.3 cfm rating that's a unit of measure cubic feet per minute but it's 2.3 at zero psi so as you start pushing air then that cfm rating on how fast it's able to push it is going to come down the more pressure is on the system so the cf rating at 100 psi is 0.85 so for those of you that kind of get into all the numbers and that means something to you there's the numbers also this is a 33 duty cycle at 100 psi the 300 is so this means that it continuously it can continuously run for 20 minutes at 100 psi before it needs to rest for 40 minutes so that's the performance ratings here let's talk about the performance ratings on the 400 the max tire size on the 400 is going to be 275 80 by 22.5 so this is the big 22.5 rims that you can see on a lot of class a's of the big superseas so it can it can certainly uh handle that so let's take a bigger tire a 37 inch tire and we'll just go ahead and say that 275 70 by 22.5 tire going from 80 to 90 psi it's going to take a minute and 38 seconds to do that still good it's it's a big tire you're pushing a lot of air these units are really strong and they're definitely going to get the job done for you it's got the same rating as the 300 as far as it's rated to 150 psi at 2.3 cfm's at zero psi and at 100 psi the cfm rating is 1.19 so this is where the difference comes in if you remember on the the 300 the cfm rating at 100 psi was 0.85 the cfm rating on the 400 at 100 psi is 1.19 so it's just able to handle the handle that more volume of a bigger tire the duty cycle on the 400 is exactly the same as the 300 is considered a 33 duty cycle at 100 psi so 20 minutes at 100 psi uh is is how long this can run before it needs to rest for 40 minutes i know this is a lot of information and i want to break it down for you just here at the end just to give you some uh some questions to ask yourself to push you in the right direction uh you know first of all if if money's not a factor and you're just like look i just want all the gadgets and all that of course just get the 400 and you don't need to think about it anymore because uh you're going to get the gas station style gun the 40 inch extendable chuck and it's going to have plenty of power to do anything that you want on your towable and be ready if you were to ever upgrade your rv in the future to maybe something bigger if you have dual tires you might want to consider getting the 400 because this one comes with the 45 degree extendable chuck here also if you want the additional uh 30 feet of hose where the 400 comes with 60 feet this only comes with 30 but you can add it something else to consider winterization kit only comes on the 400 as an optional add-on to this kit whereas the 300 it will not work on that so i guess i want to close with this if you have a towable uh no matter what size the towable is it can be a 30 foot or a 10 foot or up to a 45 footer the 300 has the power to get the job done you may consider jumping to the 400 because the the extra hose length and the additional components that you get with it if that's important to you then just go ahead and jump to the uh to the 400 it's going to air things up a little bit quicker and uh because it's got a little bit more power and you get all the gadgets hey listen i hope that this has been helpful i know it's a lot of information you can get detailed information about each unit uh on videos on our youtube channel i've done a video on all the viair systems so you can go check that out there and if you're ready to purchase your vi air system for your rv then just hop on over to

sun's shining the birds are chirping they are actually and it can only mean one more thing and that is this is the video version of the april 2021 newsletter that we're happy to bring you it's actually a beautiful time to be in mobile like these are the months that are like perfect beautiful weather this is when you want to be here right yeah april may they're beautiful so this is by choice yes okay so uh let's go through this is where we just talk about what is in the newsletter in case you would rather watch it in video form and which i prefer i would prefer to watch something in a video than read you'd probably rather really a reader yep so that's okay so we meet the masses yeah right number one we did a office tour yeah we did because we just moved into our new office a month ago and i kept putting it off because i have these grand ideas that i'm gonna have it all decorated and perfect and i realized that that could be months and months off so we just went ahead and did it we decided that that uh the the tour must be done right so yes and we've actually had uh many people coming by like youtube channels and all kinds of stuff one of them will talk about here just a little bit uh and they've done video tours but ours will be the official one because yes well it's our office it is right and so um we were excited to do that walk through so are we just showing it here or what are we doing because we didn't really talk about that we can i don't i don't even remember how long it is and i don't want this video to be too long so i'll probably put it here if you're not interested you can skip forward in the chapters below in the description okay otherwise i feel like it was maybe 10 minutes okay all right so uh so let's cut to the the office tour let's do that and then we'll come back enjoy the tour all right everybody eric and tammy here who is behind the camera hey everybody there and we've got some construction going on across the street but that is okay you see we got the techno rv sign and uh we are about to give you what i would call the official techno rv tour and uh because many others have come through and given the tour and they've all been spectacular but uh now we get to do it so we're here this is the front door welcome welcome to technoware much easier to hear you in here yeah this is much nicer so uh when you come in the front door uh this is like a little sitting area i guess uh like just an entrance room i think it's called a lobby a lobby so we have not had time to even like put pictures up we've got these grand plans that this is going to look really cool in here one day but it doesn't look so cool right now uh but it does have a couch uh for somebody to sit on and if customer were to come by we even got a little table we can hang out at a customer came by today actually they sure did and they sat right there that is where they sat so uh this room right here is so the first two rooms are still under construction right the lobby is not completed and then this room is not completed we're going to get the good stuff here a little bit but what we're going to do in this room is we're going to set up a demo room so we'll take a bunch of our products and we'll we'll set them up and then if we have customers come by then we'll be able to demonstrate them we kind of let them put their hands on the product and we've never had that before right and so it'll be nice and then they won't have to go all the way back to the warehouse and get in all that they can actually see what we carry without having to you know right exactly so uh really excited about this so i hope we can get this up and go on i do too so as we turn the corner every office needs a break room and we have one complete with a dishwasher and the berkey we got anybody got a berkey in their rv we do we have one in the rv and in the office of course and uh so anyway not much to see here but uh everything that one might expect in a uh break room is in that breaker tammy's office where all the real work gets done oh yeah so tammy has her own office and uh doesn't look like i do much that you can see from the board well you know that used to have all their business plans on oh i just erased them like this morning just erased them you just missed all my business plans but your chair looks comfortable and um so anyway this is where tammy gets her work done and then the next office which is a big change actually us not working like two feet from each other yeah so i wonder whose office this is i wonder what is this the corner office with the big window so anyway this is my office uh and it doesn't look like a whole lot of work gets done here either but it does i get my work done and uh so when we're in town anyway this is our offices when we happen to be in town and we're not out on the road rv um so let's go down the hall because we're about to get into what i would consider the good stuff so this is the operations manager's office and he must be in the back he's working on operations yes stuff happens here and uh his name is derek and i'm guessing we'll run into him i'm sure we will on the tour uh if you ever come by and you have to use the restroom look at that you have restaurants imagine that okay no office is complete without a conference room right yeah this has been nice to have when we first got it i was like what are we gonna do really with this we've already used it with the training session yeah we do we've already done many training sessions we actually had uh uh surge guard uh in last week to do a training session right and uh we've got all kinds of training sessions set up and we can have uh we've already had lots of meetings with this is where i had the goodies too this is where i had all the goodies where they coming no they're not hidden everybody trust me but uh and then we got the big tv with the camera so that when we're out of town uh out on the road and we want to conference in with the team then this is the space to do i think this is like a 14 foot it's nice we we fill it up when everybody's in here though yeah when everybody's in here it is so okay all right the next area uh well okay before we go into customer service uh we do have a mini little workout room yeah we do this was a request by a few of our employees they were like man it'd be great if we're on break if we got some high energy employees obviously room we could go into and uh burn off a little steam so uh stationary bike we're gonna get some little weights and stuff they have a vr set though that they rock climb and stuff with i haven't done it yet have you yeah so yeah if this door is closed they say it's off-limits across the hall here is every office has got like a bits and pieces room otherwise known as the junk room other than that yeah and so this is this is our bits and pieces room so uh anyway not a lot to see nope but it's got room for growth which is what we like because you know if we continue to grow we have some offices that can be converted from a bits and pieces room to an actual office this is correct okay we're about to get to the exciting stuff so everybody knows that customer service is kind of our thing and uh and we couldn't do that without great people in the customer service department so down this hall is where all these great people are so let's go check them out have we told them we're doing this no we have not told them we just and so michael has been here a few months and is quickly becoming the product expert [Laughter] and then uh maybe you called in and talked to evan and then and then just worked out see see people use it on the treadmill or climbing or whatever you did uh kickboxing for ten minutes and then um three miles on the bike wow okay sweet people are actually using that there you go good so uh i know she makes me feel lazy so just another just another perk of the technical rv office and then if you've called in and talked to allison we're going to sneak around here when are you working out today allison have you worked out today all right well the room's waiting for yes so anyway this uh we'll let y'all get back to it yeah so as everybody knows customer service is super important to us and they're the ones that uh make it happen so we're glad that you got to meet everybody and this is our server room and uh really nothing to really get into here there's a lot of brains of the operation back here besides your brains of the operation i'm not even about to start explaining it okay all right now that was three thousand square feet of office space and as promised we have three thousand square feet of warehouse space and uh because shipping accuracy and uh the speed at which we ship is also very important to our business model and that all happens through the store right here and everybody in this area loves to be on camera so where are they they're all running they're scattering what are they doing did we not tell them either i don't think we do uh so anyway this is this is the warehouse it's 3 000 square feet as i said and so basically orders will come in to our printing station over here and then this is where all of our product is and we'll we'll kind of tour all all of this i hear some giggling going on somewhere we're about to go fine now and uh and so then after the orders are printed then they are picked and put on the conveyor belt over here and then once they are picked then they uh come down here during the conveyor belt and then they are they are packed and so that is the process we have uh the absolute best warehouse employees of the entire united states absolutely and who was that who would say this is christy by the way this is christy she does she doesn't know rv that's right roll tide raw of course of course uh let's see here who do we have here oh cha-cha and uh oh derek remember uh derek was not in his office and i presume he was doing something important exactly and and see he's doing operations like you said helping build boxes because we are all a big team here and uh when one department needs help we jump right to it which is what he said uh so this is all of our our racks with all of our products so surge guards on the front row we've got all of our sort of staying connected uh products on the second row with our our reboost and pep wave products and our wi-fi boosters this row with all of our tire pressure monitoring systems you know tst and tire reminder brands and then we have our propane safety devices the gas stop and garmin way back there and then our garmin gps's and then when we get here we've got our berkeys which you saw in our break room and the vision works uh rear observable yeah the new cameras right here and then uh by ears here and then of course we have pallets of pie ears over here yeah the big ones we keep on pallets and then soft start soft starch and spark plug and smart plug yes and so uh what happens is once they're packed then right when we walked in you see all of the the rolling racks with all the boxes completed on them and then so that's ups usps and fedex they all come pick up every day okay and then we'll just roll them to these roll-up doors here and then they just pull up and take them out so we have our cut off time is two o'clock every day so usually about two o'clock well not usually every day everything in here is done and then it's uh kind of prep clean up get ready for the for the next day to do it all over again and i think we're missing one we are missing taylor taylor is does most of our printing and so ah here she is uh this is hey taylor so she does a lot of our printing and computer work what do we got going on here product testing product testing there you go okay there you go so she does excellent at that and so thank you and so that kind of rounds out the warehouse area uh we could show them the parking lot back area that we're going to be working on let's go check that out good gracious it's bright out here so uh plenty of parking for uh you know the employees and everybody here and then we have this this uh big back line and there right now it's kind of a parking lot it's not really anything but we are gonna uh lay dirt and level it out and then put a bunch of limestone back here so if we're coming through uh town and uh we could keep our army back here and although we've had a lot of guests that come in vehicles it would be a place to turn around if it was just like i'm dropping by and i do have the rv you could make the loop and turn around back here yes if somebody came by here in the rv then absolutely they wouldn't get stuck no because we have 18 wheelers and everything else coming up in here so this this is done for an rv it would be nothing to make the turn here so uh anyway that is the office compliments of course hey we hope you enjoyed our tour and just to let you know we are in the county of mobile alabama it's actually a theodore alabama uh address and uh you know what if you happen to be coming through the area and you want to stop by to uh see the place you're welcome to do so yeah we're right off i-10 right right off of i-10 yep uh on rain off of rangeline road and so it might be a good idea to maybe shoot an email into us or uh even call to let us know uh that you're you're coming by just in case uh because sometimes me and tammy are here which we don't have to be here for you to come by especially if you if a lot of times people order something they just want to come pick something up that's not a problem because you'll work through customer service on that anyway we hope you enjoyed the tour and we will see you down the road we're back yes hope you all enjoyed that we had a good time videoing it we did i don't know that employees uh sometimes we do and sometimes we don't we'll we'll just they'll turn around and they're then like like three weeks ago they turned around like mark and trish from keep your daydream we're in there a video and we're like oh yeah we'll go with the full we didn't mention that they were going to be here but we do love the new office it's been um we've been a month in it or something it's shocking to think that's where we have come in six years but um i can already tell that we're doing a better job and able to meet customers needs better there and just i love it we're very proud of the place and again it was necessary for us to do that and uh because again we wanted to be able to do everything we could to stock the inventory be able to provide the service customer support and all that stuff that we are known for so uh that's it that's the tour let's move on so uh number two there is we we have two sales going on this month uh and that's not counting the flash sale that will come out later this month we always do that right sale right that'll come out that'll come later uh but garmin the garmin 1090 is 100 off this month the garmin 1090 first of all it's an rv gps which means you enter your height your weight how many propane tanks you have and then it will route you according to the size of your rig and i know that when we started rving is one of my biggest concerns of driving this big thing around and even if it wasn't this when we were in our fifth wheel or uh we've got a travel trailer too i like to be routed the way my particular rv that i'm in is meant to be yeah it's different if like we were just going to mayor state park here in mobile we know that route but man the minute you get outside your your area you're comfortable with you have no idea what's around the corner you know you just it would be scary to travel without one it would be and so but it's not scary anymore no and it never was scary because we've never run without from day one we've always run an rv gps and i'm going to show the monster the garmin is the pick of the litter uh and and it's the one that we've used for many years now and we love the garmin they have made great units uh they're uh of course we provide customer service but they're great helping us with customer service they do support our um philosophy of supporting customers after the sale yes yes so it's important the 1090 is a 10 inch screen there is no other one like it uh the the now garmin makes an eight inch screen i think other companies on the market one other company used to do an eight eight inch screen i don't know if anybody got rid of that now they're all seven inches so garmin actually does an eight and a ten so here's the thing and it's it's it's you can view it in portrait or landscape which is which is cool because yes yeah it's cool for a lot of reasons but it it's it's uh i actually like what's the one straight up is that i know because you like the bottom to hang off and it takes less yeah i like less i can see more of the road going up like this right right so it comes with a cool magnetic mount and it and all the great like world-class like navigation capabilities that garmin's known for it's built in okay the reason i love the garmin over some of the other ones we've used is the voice navigation on this is so much better like before we had a garmin the i pretty much was always entering stuff and looking for the rest rest area and i was i was the navigator almost and then i just pop it back up and let him drive now i don't ever touch this thing because you pretty much navigate 100 hands-free voice navigation and it like legit works not no it's no there's no guesswork so right like if i'm driving down the road i can say hey garmin where is the next rest area and it'll pop all the rest areas up and they'll be numbered yes and then i just say number three and it'll say do you want to just go ahead and add that to your route and you say yes and then it's just kind of done and it's really put you more in control of um the navigation and stuff and not me which i like because you know that's that's one of the top three stressful things in a marriage is is navigating you still help me navigate into a spot oh yeah i'm talking about like on the road finding things you're just you're more in control now of the gps and i like that it takes one less thing off sometimes i wish the garmin could help me with that you know i do too so uh a couple of things i want to mention about the 1090 that screen's big okay so uh you know here's how here's what i'm envisioning people with like bigger rvs like this one behind us where you get that big huge windshield the 10 inch yeah it doesn't even right right now we've definitely got some people in like big f-350s and 450s that are getting this but a lot of those people prefer like the 8 inch screen which is the 890 right so um it's something to think about but a hundred dollars off for the entire month of april at technorv.com and we have a learning series uh the 890 and the 1090 for those people kind of wondering what's the difference they're identical in every way except size so we have one learning series for both the eight inch and the ten inch man the birds really are out today so the 890 operates the exact same way the only difference is the size screen yes so and that sale is just on our site no coupon code necessary right just just go add it to the card and and you can uh you can get the discount okay uh last month we did a uh top three like items that every rver that we think is like yeah it's it's almost the cost of just getting into the rv world you need these but you say we think that i think it's a consensus from any body that's been rving any amount of time those at least the top two the surge guard and the tpms those are must-haves i think for most rvers the gas stop's a relatively new product so a lot of people don't even know it exists but i agree those three are like the safety products must have just get them when you get the rv and that was a great sale and a lot of people took advantage of that right so electrical protection tire pressure monitoring and uh the gas stop propane automatic shut off device we've got an article on that on our website if you missed it last month you can go check it out so what we thought we would do this month is is because those are like the items you just gotta have gotta have and and so this month what we thought is is but what do people over and above that what's like on their wish list yes we do have wish list items that um people it's not it's not the thing you could rv without it but man it'd make it a little easier yeah so uh the two items are uh the vibe i wonder what the two items are yeah now you can take the 1090 down now we can uh because these are the two items left up here so the the viair which a lot of people have have heard of that brand the valley air it's just a high quality tire inflator um that it comes in four different sizes uh and it's basically just set up to where the size the size that you need is depending on the the type of rv that you have so if you're in a class b you get the the value 89 if you're in a smaller towable then you get 300 if you're in a large towable or a big class c then you get the 400 if you're a big class a you get the 450. and we've made lots of videos on this we have an individual video for each type we have a comparison of all four and then recently we made one comparing the 300 and 400 because that's kind of a gray area if you have a large towable you could go either way so um to make that decision there's so much information out there that we're not going to talk about right now but i do want you to show them the size of it because that to me is what's shocking because we used to carry around that big red thing what like a traditional air conditioner like a big pancake and you had to plug it into a 110 like a like an ac outlet right and that's all i thought of as a tire inflator when we got this i was like oh that's nice and so this is my own personal one it's the 450 that's the biggest one they make if that gives you any idea when you just hold this unit you can just just tell that it's a high quality unit and it does operate off 12 volt power and it's not near as loud as an air compressor it's not even close so 12 volt power i know this little tangle tail sorry that's our own bag so anyway what this means is for rvers it's like no matter where you're at you can always get power to it because you've got your your batteries right so if you're gonna you can hook it to your your like your truck's batteries always make sure your the truck's turned on once you get it hooked up to make sure it's getting good power or you can connect it to your rv's battery as long as the rv is connected to short power i had a couple people asking recently and it's one of the things we've actually used it for is we we get it obviously for the rv but we'll throw it in the jeep when we go off in the jeep because we've aired down and aired the tires up just right out there and not have to worry about it so i had people asking can you use it for like your towed vehicle or your tow or your jeep or whatever we tossed this thing all over the place you know yeah we use it for the the rv you've inflated my paddle board with it before i did do that i did do that so uh anyway the the fire is a excellent device because you should have the tire pressure monitoring system right and so if you ever get alarm that you have low pressure uh you know hopefully you have time to maybe get up to the next exit and uh and get some assistance but you know if there's not a place to air up your tires or a place that you feel comfortable even getting into you can always uh air your tire up until you can get to that tire professional safely whatever's right for that particular situation of course but uh did you say that that a lot of gas stations can't even get you up to the right psi did i zone out why you said that that well because i think you definitely have that situation but then there there's are gas stations that can get you the right pressure on some of the bigger tires right so it could be hit or miss yep absolutely but a lot of the air compressors that you might uh because this will go up to 150 psi and there's a lot of these things that you can just go buy like a walmart or a home depot or something that that would struggle mightily with that so uh the vaya they're just built for this they're small they're compact and that and that's of course important for uh rvers and so that's a good wish list yeah so um anyway the viair uh if you don't already have one because i know a lot of the people that are on our newsletter have them but there's a lot of people that don't now it's time to do it because we got a sale on that we're gonna talk about in a minute so that's number one wish list right number two wish list is uh it's really another safety item for me and it is it did almost make the top four for last month because it really it's borderline safety i agree last month was a top three and it just missed the cut if we'd done a top four it would have definitely been only four spot as a safety item right because uh you you need rear observation uh visual to safely uh move around in your rv so whether that's a uh you know an rv like this towing a vehicle keeping an eye on that vehicle behind you knowing whenever you can uh change lanes now a lot of rvs come with uh rear observation cameras and if that's the case for you then beautiful right you've got it covered there's a lot of rvs that do not come with it some of them come like pre-wired right and and that's uh great but pre-wire just means that it they got the power to that is a that is awesome though to have them pre-wired where you don't have to figure out and run it from another light so but you still have to go by the oh yeah the camera system and so the vision works is uh we found these guys through one of our customers actually bought this unit was like guys you got to check this out and we did and we were like how did we miss this right and we immediately got in contact with the company the quality on this unit is spectacular and i want to i want to read a few things because uh just about the uh performance of this unit so or just some some things that you need to know about it because the top systems on the market are furion voyager yep and vision works right so the visionworks has a three year warranty whereas as voyager and furion only have a one year warranty uh the wireless range is the static range is a thousand feet on this one the closest competitor is 500 feet now that's static clear line of sight right you're not getting that in an rv but is there some is it a bug you're good you're good i felt it i was like is that my hair touch your neck [Laughter] so uh the the range was important to us and it's wireless and we've tested this thing in a lot of different ways the wireless range is excellent yes the durability rating uh it has an ip68 rating whereas like the fury on so it's like a metal housing on the camera whereas like the furion's a plastic housing and it's an ip65 rating it records whereas furion and voyager don't so you can actually record what's coming through the uh the the or whatever it's seeing the night vision that blew me away yeah that did because that was when we were testing a lot of cameras that was always the question like night vision how's the night vision um a lot of people don't drive at night but some people do and when you do that's critical and the night vision is like it goes into the black and white military-looking night vision and it's extremely it accomplishes this because it has 18 ir led lights built into this unit whereas uh like furion has six uh am i slamming on furion too much here i'm just doing specs right um and it's got quad view which furion does have that go furion and it it does all this for 150 cheaper than these other competitors so like a seven inch screen with with everything that you need to get going with the monitor and the camera is is is 499 where the competitors are 650 and they're a great company like they're really works they're very customer service oriented as well any issues we may have had because you know electronics um they are quick to uh they're customer oriented and we love that about them we love that about and if you have a pre-wire for a furion or a voyager you say you got an rv and you might notice on the back your rv it's got this little plastic housing it's just like a dummy housing that means you're pre-wired and vision works has the brackets that work with the the furion brackets and the voyager so or universal if you don't have a pre-wire or universal so when you order one you just will have a drop down menu and if you're like yep i've got a fury on pretty wire you just click fury on and then we'll send you that exact furion bracket that works with this so and voyager is coming out and you're gonna have to give me more specifics on this but they are coming out it works what does it say i think you said voyager my bad vision works is coming out with the side marker light cameras in the next month or so the side marker cameras i believe that we will and i'm glad you brought that up because a lot of people uh from the tampa show and all that were asking when they were going to come out with those uh so so vision works is supposed to get their first shipment in by mid-april okay i suspect that we will have them by the end of april the side market night so you could go ahead and get this system and then you can add side marker later we'll probably email everybody that has purchased a vision works when they come in and just you know that's what we want to add or something uh anyway so that's another wish list because your rv comes with it wired doesn't come with it is one of those things you have to add and it does make a difference yeah that's included in the wishlist sale today so we can't just highlight it and not give a sale of course not so here's the deal uh we're gonna do a spin off of what we did last month if you buy one of these items you get eight percent off if you buy two of them you get uh ten percent so if you bought this eight percent if you just bought this eight percent if you buy both of them you get ten percent off both of them right right okay so that's a spectacular sale because we sell uh both of them at lowest yeah we're the lowest on the market on these anyway right and let me point something out with the vale we sell the newest model the model that's on amazon is not the newest model out there right uh not trying to slam it i don't remember what it is but it's not the 400p dash rvs it's right there it'll say 400p rv that's not the newest model the rvs is the newest model and and we only sell the the newest latest and greatest stuff right right so um so keep that in mind so you're gonna need to use a coupon code to get the discounts right if you just go on the front if you just go without the coupon code they're full price this is just for newsletter people so we like to give you guys more than just the general public coming to the site so you can't find this on you don't get this unless you use the code and the code is wish list one word wish list wishlist wishlist no wish list wish list you know like you add to when when you're shopping add to my wishlist right so add it to the cart go to checkout it'll ask you for your promo code wishlist yes and then it'll it'll give you the discount right okay so we're good with that all right we got a few more things because we got a giveaway coming up so yes i missed last month's giveaways i know everybody wants to jump online and go handle it right but don't do it now no uh but because we got a giveaway coming up so uh real quick because i want to get to the to this just real quick i made a a blip about the pep wave cellular routers we launched these several months ago uh going super super great they are we love it it is our new way of sort of staying connected on the road these units are powerful i'm not going to get into everything but in our newsletter we've got probably the two main videos that i made about kind of hey what are these things actually doing and then the models that we sell so if you've thought about kind of amping up your staying connected on the road arsenal then you've got to check out the pep waves and just go watch this it is a good option it's i'm not going to say it's for everyone but it would meet the needs for a lot of rvers so absolutely even if you think you're looking for a new set up for staying connected it would be worth watching the video of at least what it does yes so we kind of got famous right [Laughter] so mark and trish from keep your daydream came by to visit us yeah that was that was a nice treat it was a great time is that the last time we we ran into them at the rv entrepreneur summit a couple years ago they've come by the older the old office yeah they've become friends of ours and we've been able to hang out with them many times and and uh i don't know we just we just click with them you know and so uh they came down they did a tour of the office we ate crawfish and uh went out in the boat anyway they made a video about it they did and they and they just launched it and so if you want to see us on the keep your daydream uh youtube channel then then go over there and check it out yeah i um i don't watch a lot of youtube um just because i don't but that they were a channel that intrigued me from the very beginning before they even were large um their personalities they just are very authentic and i was always curious like if i met them i wonder if they're like that in person exactly like that exactly like what you said what you see is what you get whether the cameras are on or the cameras are off and i loved that about them i mean it's they're just authentic and they're just enjoying life and they do a great job educating so i do love their channel yeah and we we we click with them because our personality so the episode if you go watch it it's it's a bit of a clown show we're goofing off a lot you're goofing yeah and so but but anyway it's a lot of fun so go check that out and uh they are a good channel to subscribe to uh okay let's get let's give something away all right all right so we went into the techno rv treasure chest the technology treasure chest and we and we got uh oh where's my name so okay so we got we got a bunch of things somebody's getting a bunch of things so uh first you're getting uh this book 100 parks 5000 ideas yeah we did a virtual rally last year and that was one of my books that did not get given were not was not given away and it was a popular one because it's it's pretty cool great pictures yeah the national geographic books about travel are all uh broommate you're getting a uh this is what is this this is basically just a regular can holder but it's it's pretty good i love the brew mates i use them a lot uh a garmin another tumbler yes a garmin tumbler right and nothing it would nothing would be complete nothing is complete without a techno rv hat we should sell these we did at one point but we ran out a lot of the styles so we took them down are they not on our site anymore okay i need to order more we'll order more but somebody's gonna get one for free okay so uh the winner tammy has already drawn the winner to save time here much easier to do it this way all right the winner is the winner and this is i drew from everybody that's on the newsletter list that's i just do a math yeah okay so it's brian sack like a quarterback gets sacked without the ed it's just sack right brian sack somebody got making it more confusing he knows who he is right uh okay so i'm going to email you and get an address to ship this to you uh congratulations and thank you for being on earth and we're always in the drawing everybody that's everybody that's in the newsletter right of course you've got this email you're in the drawing yeah you're in it hey congratulations brian you're getting a lot of cool stuff here we know you'll be excited about that and i'm excited for you okay so we're ending here uh april is a month of uh new life and growth uh in nature i don't know where i'm at i might say where are you going with this so what i'm saying is i want everybody to go out and have a good time rving in the month yes so y'all be careful out there and we will see you next

{"id": "ptipM6bj53o", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "rrZWwJ6ZrcWpRT4D8qvx1PCrSZw", "transcript": "hey everybody it is eric and tammy here from techno rv and we have a topic today that we want to talk about that we have written probably a few articles on this topic and it is when you get an rv what are the top three things that i would say most people would agree with as it relates to technology as it relates to technology that you probably just need to go ahead and get along with the purchase of of your rv right we're not talking like water hose sewer hose like those no no because those probably are yeah must-haves so this technology type type stuff right so uh i say we just jump right in and uh well we're kind of giving it away right here but the first one is you have to protect the electrical system in your in your arduino and so you do this with what's called an electrical protection system in this case the system that we've used for uh since we've been rv and is the surge guard brand of electrical protection system and i think we should just talk about what all it does and why every rv or like no joke every rv should should have this yeah when we first got the rv it was kind of like we you know we were brand new to it and we jumped into it really quickly we didn't do a lot of research but in the little bit of research we did we learned really quickly that was the first thing we should buy we actually had it when we got the rv because i mean the first of all rv electrical systems are so different than houses that in itself was just different yeah but um we heard enough about power not being steady power not being consistent you know different than a house and you don't buy you know our first rv was a fifth wheel you don't buy and spend that kind of money you know and without protecting it i guess in some way and so a lot of people think of surges like oh i gotta protect against surges and while you do need to do that there's a lot more that you have to protect against as it relates to just rv park power so you just think about it like this this power pedestals here and and you know a thousand people could have come before you plugging into this unit and i've i've seen them uh run over uh drug down the road i mean just people pull off with these attached to them and yank things from them i mean stuff happens it's just what it is it just stuff happens and then i've seen people like grabbing the cable and just pulling the the cord out which weakens the the brass fingers that that uh hold the plug in yeah the comparison for me is like wall outlets in houses ones that get used over and over and over and over again they get they get loose they get you know it affects i guess you don't want to use that plug because you know it's kind of right loose same thing happens with rv poses so uh so it brings us to the wiring on the our of the pedestal you have got to ensure that you have a good ground you have to ensure that you have a good neutral and you you don't want any reverse polarity issues going on so the ground basically is where uh excess voltage is is sent to so if there is excess voltage or even just uh it's really for like uh leakage voltage leakage uh in an rv if there's nowhere for that to go or if you have a little bit of a spike and there's nowhere to that for that to go it can go to the frame of your rv right so that's not good now your your rv is now charged um and so a ground is super important because when you have a ground that's where that excess voltage goes so got to have a ground a neutral all right so if you're in a 30 amp rv and you don't have a neutral like just not gonna work right okay and and so uh which is probably a good thing but but but in a in a in a 50 amp rv so lucky in a 50 amp rv you're not so lucky right in that it things will work but you can have what's called uh people call it all different kinds of things but accidental 240 is one so in a 50 amp rv you've got 220 volt legs coming into your rv right and they share one neutral right because they're out of phase with each other right it's how they can share that one neutral if you lose that neutral which the neutral is the return path of power right your hotlines bring the uh power in your hot lines bring the power in and the return path is that neutral all the way back to the surface panel right if you lose that neutral those two 120 volt lines can come together and create what's called accidental 240 and really what it what it comes down to is you'll have high voltage on one side of your rv and very low voltage on another both of which are bad for whatever's plugged in or both are weird yeah so you got to have a good neutral right uh at reverse polarity this is where your your neutral and your hotline were miswired if you're if you have reverse polarity on the pedestal every outlet in your rv is now reverse polarity which is so creepy yeah so if somebody at the pedestal made a mistake and why why are it wrong yeah it does happen there's a reason it tests for it that's right then your whole rv is reverse polarity now will everything work in your rv or power outlets will they work they sure will but the problem is is that they can leave things charged while they're in the off position for example let's say you have a toaster best example and you push it down your toast goes down and it pops up right and your toast gets stuck in there right but it's in the off position right because it popped up with reverse polarity those coils are still charged even though it's off now you take a fork and you go fishing your toast out which nobody should ever you should never i think if the toasters come with warnings to never do that so you should never do this this worst case scenario it's worst case uh those those coils are charged right so this is why reverse polarity is bad okay all right so with a total electrical protection system when you plug these in and you flip the breaker it does a the surge guard does a 10 second inspection on the wiring and it makes sure there's good ground good for neutral and no reverse polarity if there's not it's going to tell you on the lcd display that you've got an open ground or open neutral reverse polarity and it will not give you power that's a good thing but let's say everything's good you flip it it you get get power to the rv now what it's doing is protecting against surges right right so if there is a surge in the area that it can uh it can absorb that and snap you off from it all right so that the the surge won't get to your rv more importantly though it's protecting against low and high voltage good point good point so uh low voltage probably happens more than anything uh in our experience and all the bunch of other rvers that we talk to and see online and all that and this is basically there's a couple of things going on here um if if a lot of people are turning their ac units on that can that can pull things down and lower the voltage we talked to to uh southwire the other day which is the company that owns surge guard uh we had a meeting with them and we were talking about just like the standards for our rv parts when they're building out a grid for an rv park yeah i was asking him i'm like what is the big deal about low voltage i get that it's the most common but why is it the most common fault like what is the deal with low voltage and i didn't know i mean i was yeah so the the answer was that the the standards the the electrical standards uh don't say that they have to build a rv park uh electrical grid uh to as if it's at full capacity you do not have to provide enough power for 100 capacity right and so to be at code yeah so but in rv parks they're looking to save money so there's there's they're going to build it to code and probably that's kind of it and now you know how many how many parts these days are are like not full yeah they're probably all full you know what i mean so it was a staggering number and i can't recall it exactly right now but it was something like if you have more than 10 sites uh you only have to fill it to like 40 40 or 50 percent pretty sure it was 40. yes staggering numbers like like don't have to provide 50 of the power that would be required if you were 100 full so you know if you're in a full campground and you're in a campground that has built to code it's highly likely highly likely you're going to be drawing you're going to be in a brown out low voltage situation yeah so uh low voltage is is anything 102 volts or or below right and so low voltage the bad thing about low voltage is there's there's this lack of cause and effect with low voltage in that you can have low voltage and things will run but it's decreasing the life of your electronic components and you probably won't even know what's happening unless you get like really low but i mean you know heck if you're at like 95 volts i mean everything or but you're reducing the life of those components now you wake up one morning something's not working yeah you don't know what to attribute it to yeah like air conditioner you think oh these rv air conditioners there they don't last oh well maybe they do and you've just not been giving it the voltage and what a pain that is to replace yeah for sure and then high voltage is anything of 132 volts or above uh that's different from a surge that's just that's just there's high voltage in the area and that can have uh bad effects on your electronic components too so the surge guard yeah the good news is to take care of all of that you don't even have to understand what it means and you might not even care because this does it already for you so i know this stuff now because we've been doing this so long but even if you know that could freak you out that all this stuff happens but if you use and total electrical protection none of that is going to get through to your rv and you're going to be notified of it and protected from it so that's the more important thing i mean it is cool why it's caused and what it all is but the reality is just tell me that's not going to get my rv is what i want to know right the search guard will handle it they they they're so confident in in this this product here that that their warranty is basically it's a it's called a limited lifetime warranty with connected equipment coverage that connected equipment coverage is what kind of puts them over the top being the best warranty on the market yeah and that means that if this fails to do what it was intended to do and something in your rv gets uh zapped damaged uh damaged uh then then surge guard will pay for the cost of whatever got damaged so that's pretty high confidence level we left something out another thing that surge guard has a patent on oh i'm sorry the literally forgot yeah so everything we've talked about that wiring the hi-lo surge that's called that's load side protection which means it's coming from the pet side man you got me all thrown off here you're right that's line side right that's at the line right there's something else called load side protection which is stuff in your rv it's the side that's actually pulling the power in right surge guard has the patent on load side protection which means it can detect elevated ground currents and open neutral conditions inside the rv right so if you were to lose a neutral in your rv having the same effects that we've already talked about this can detect that if you have this over voltage situation inside of an rv like you shouldn't have a uh a lot of over voltage on a ground line and that's what it is it's detecting that ground line and and if you do there's a problem yep and so this will detect it and and cut you off so more protection than any other unit from that alone let alone other features and and for us is full-time rvers and owners of technology like this is what we do we check check the units out and we're like we pick somebody else may have a different opinion that's fine but uh we only sell what we consider to be like the best on the market and by all means this is the thirty four nine fifty one this is the uh the current current unit 50 amp model as of april 2021 then the 34 931 is the current model as of april 2021 for 38 models and something i want to point out because i read about this a lot on social media when we talk about total electrical protection that generally well it doesn't generally it does mean the high low voltage protection in addition to surge and not only does it detect miswired pedestals but it will protect you from it some of the lesser expensive ones that are just surge only they will let you know if a pedestal is miswired but it doesn't protect you from it and they don't have low high voltage total electrical protection ems electrical management system those are all referring to those units that have the high low voltage protection and uh the protection from the misfired pedestal yeah those are terms that are they're kind of marketing terms for companies the company has their own name if somebody was like does this have ems i would be like well that's not the term that's used by surge guard but by ems you mean does it have total electrical protection yes it does have it they just call it something different so uh okay well i think that covers electricity so there's a lot more videos on electricity we actually have an article that's like the complete guide to what it covers what to take into consideration should you lock it all this kind of stuff and um i'll link to that in the article too okay uh so the next one on the list um is tire pressure monitoring systems for your rv and we actually uh carry two brands but this isn't necessarily just just about the products it's about what is the problem that we're resolving here right so uh you know everything's riding on your tires and you know we're we're trying to prevent that blowout right that that is just unexpected blowout well the problem is is that most blowouts are preceded by something they're a surprise to to you but there was something going on there that if you would have known that was going on you would have known that in the future i'm gonna have a blowout if i don't do something about this and that is low pressure and high temperature usually precede a blowout because what happens is you get low pressure typically by a valve stem leak or a puncture or osmosis which is basically just over time the air is leaking out right those are typically the three ways that you lose air and attack let's say you're driving you get a nail in your tire okay you don't know it you're driving down the road you think everything's good and you start to lose pressure as the pressure goes down the footprint of your tire gets bigger right you know what a flat tire looks like as it starts to pan a marshmallow that generates uh more resistance on the road and generates heat and the heat is at the end of the day what ends up causing the blowout when a tire hits 200 degrees or a bit north of 200 degrees the compounds in the tire begin to break down this is when the blowout happens but the nail in the tire is what actually preceded it that's why tire pressure monitoring systems are so crucial because they monitor pressure and temperature right right and not just tires getting punctures or leaks it can also be like breaks and stuff causing heat build up as well that has nothing to do with because tires do cause you know tires are part of the problem with blowouts but a lot of times heat is generated especially on towed vehicles from brakes and stuff and it does that too you don't think of it you're thinking of just protecting your tire but it actually could be uh your braking system or something else generating heat so on on like a towed vehicle uh if your brakes don't fully release that generates an enormous amount of heat if you're in a towable maybe the bearings in in the the wheel hubs are freezing up generates an enormous amount of heat and again the tires they they hit 200 degrees or a little bit north of that and you don't even have to have a leak at that point the tires can't handle that type of temperature and eventually they'll blow out because we do hear that too is is the the you know just be an enormous heat on on something that causes that so tire pressure monitoring systems you have a sensor that you screw onto the valve stem and they're pressure activated and from that sensor it sends the information to a monitor that sits with you where you're driving at well you say they're pressure activated the two that we sell are pressure activated good points some units on the market uh are are what's called motion activated and they don't start sending information until you're moving which i think's silly because you wanna you want your information before you start moving in the morning right so by the way you know your your pre-trip inspection should always include checking the air pressure and inspecting your tires when you have a tire pressure monitoring system it eliminates the need for you to check the pressures because this is going to check it for you should still do a visual inspection of the tires right but uh but this will take care of you having to go around and stick each valve stem anyway so you've got the information coming to a monitor now if you have low pressure uh high pressure a rapid pressure release high temperature high temperature you're going to get alarmed and it's going to tell you what tire positions in that out of the range of what it should be yeah so it tells you which tires an alarm it and you know depending on what's going on if it's if it's like you hit just the the part of the low pressure parameter that you have preset in the system uh then you've got a decision to make you know what i mean i mean the goal is to to you know get off the road safely see it maybe you can make it up to the next exit if it's not a rapid pressure release and it's a slow leak you might be able to make it to the next egg you got to make that decision on your own but the idea is that you would be able to get off the road safely examine the situation maybe it's there is a puncture but then you can get back in and make it to the next exit and get to a tire professional um but that is what these systems are for and to me every rv or should have one oh it's not even close because you see these people that that have blowouts and and and it blows out the underside of their rvs it blows out the propane lines and and then just you know the then you gotta you know you got the tire damage right you've never driven anywhere without it i remember one time after an rv show we were using our monitor as our display in the booth and we packed it up on the jeep in the alley boxes tight and we were about to head out and you're like where's my monitor and literally unpacked everything i wasn't leaving there's like no way am i pulling out that will be the time that something happens and you don't go anywhere no absolutely i won't drive ten feet with the jeep has them and the rv yeah i just maybe you know being in this business we talk to too many people that have problems and and it's it's not necessary to have the problem this will resolve it in most cases now you can't have just that that rare situation where they're just there's two brands uh we personally use the tst tire pressure monitoring system here and this is the system we've used for five years yeah five years uh on the road it worked a long time i mean all the time never had issues with it it's a great company uh great customer service um and again we've we've had the tst in 49 states and it's never uh failed us tire miner is another great system and uh the reason that we started carrying the tire miner is because uh they had a model they had two models that were a little bit different than the tst i mean the general thing is they're they're all doing the same thing they're moderate pressure and temperature right so uh but ts to tireminder has one that can operate off of an app on your phone um and then they also have like an economical version that is is it's less expensive it's not as many bells and whistles yeah but it does the job and it's gonna alarm you it's just not probably as high-end feature rich as the tst one is yeah it's you know it's it's it's like a car you know they'll all get you somewhere and and uh you know do you like the the features and the bells and whistles and all that but we've tested both and we stand behind both absolutely 100 we've just been tst people tst has the flow through sensor and the cap sensor um whereas tireminder is cap sensor only but they all work the same so we have a lot of videos on how to pick the right sensor more about the features of them um everything you would ever want to know about comparison of the two if it's something you're looking at but i would recommend everyone be monitoring their tire so uh a lot of times these videos that we make are uh time sensitive in that maybe a particular product is going to be coming out in the future and so tammy mentioned flow through and cap with the tst and the tire miner only has the cap sensors and tire monitor is coming out with a flow-through sensor uh and so if somebody watched this few months down the road then yeah just know that that and when those come out we'll make up more videos on it after we test it yeah uh so anyway that kind of covers it on tire pressure monitoring system so uh you gotta gotta have the electrical test you gotta have the tire pressure monitoring system and then the next one is propane safety if you have propane in your rv then it is a big concern to make sure that you have some safety measures in place oh yeah to protect you from a propane leak they put you know they put the lp um alarms inside it i mean you know there's it there's issues with propane leaks there's you need to be alarmed of propane leaks but there really wasn't anything out there that's like hey we'll let you know we're having one we'll you know but this one stops it yeah so so instead of just being alarmed it's like no i don't know why maybe i just didn't put a whole lot of thought into it but i always thought there was something in place you would assume that if there was a leak that something would cut that leak off and and as it turns out there there is uh there is something called an excess flow valve uh in your propane line and if there's a leak it'll cut off i forget the exact number but like 75 percent of the leak that excess flow valve will uh do that um but that's not enough like like like that other 25 can fill up an rv like that right and so in my mind it's like no if there's a leak i i want it cut off 100 and so so gas stop is is is the device and it's an uh 100 automatic shut-off device and it's so simple i know it's so simple you you basically just why didn't we come up with that yeah oh you basically just screw the gas stop onto uh your tank and and then you you you take the line that you would normally go straight to the tank and then you just put it on the other gas stop and then you there's there's a little primer button you push it it pressurizes it and then if you have a leak and i've got a video where i actually demonstrate this yeah i'll link to i'll i'll put it above so people yeah yeah so i actually demonstrate a leak and i'm telling you what it is every single time in an instant and what it is is there's a ball bearing in here and it is it is uh tuned to cut off uh the flow of that propane if the flow gets above 75 000 btus so does that 75 000 you know take into account using a lot of propane things at the same time yeah this a lot a lot of testing obviously went into place to say hey uh for you know a normal rv like water what is the level that normal flow of propane is normal okay right and then and then what's that level to where it's like now if you get to that level then you got a leak right and so so that's that's the level they could have put it anywhere right so uh so that this wasn't just an afterthought a lot of testing went into this and yeah it's it's uh 75 000 is the number i mean if you get a leak a cut or something like that you're blasting past 75 000 and that's whatever you want to be cut off of uh in in an instant uh if you have two propane tanks on board you need two uh of the gas stop uh devices and there are two different fittings um so if you're in like a a big motor home that's got one of the big built-in tanks that's called a pol connection point and if if you're in one that looks more like a barbecue grill type thing for like a towable or something like that that's called an acme style connection point and we have that information on the website on the page on to help you pick which ones yeah technorv.com if you if you go to gas stop we've got pictures and stuff that's like that's the one you need right there and then of course you can call us if you've got any questions but yeah propane safety is a big deal something you don't think about a lot and this this will be like get this and you won't have to think about it right and they just came out with a new adapter for gas stock called gas gear good point so um so what can happen is is uh well i haven't taken the measurements on that but i would say that's what four or four inches or so right there across and uh so if you have a like a casing that goes over your propane tanks a lot of travel trailers have that on the front yeah and that casing is super tight like to those propane tanks a lot of times you can you can rotate the tanks right to where this hitting pointing straight towards like the casing you can rotate it in right and then you then you can still put your connection point on and then there's some cases where maybe you just can't make that work so what uh gas stop did is they came up with uh basically a 90 degree uh turn on that connection point i kind of like it anyway because a lot of the times even if you're even if you're not using a gas stop a lot of times that line coming off that propane tank comes in and it hits that uh that casing and comes down and a lot of times it can start wearing and things so i kind of like the 90 degree turn anyway but in some cases you might need it with the gas stop so we needed it with the rockwood absolutely we needed it yeah yeah the rockwood that we have uh was was exactly that i couldn't rotate them to the point to get it uh and the gas gear 90 degree fix the problem just like that so um you know i think that covers it it's it's you know it's the three items that we just feel like are the absolute items that you have to have if you're gonna go out rv in electrical protection tire pressure monitoring propane safety well the way i see it and i think i've said this before to me these are the three products that you need to monitor non-stop you need to monitor your tires non-stop while driving you need to monitor your electricity non-stop while you're getting it and you need to monitor propane and you can't do that so this does something that nobody can do these things need to be monitored 24 7 when they're being used and there's nothing that can do that so it's you know it's one of those things that only a device like this um can ensure one that you're safe it's an excellent point uh you know banging on your tires and you know some people check the pedestal right when they get there and everything's fine but you know all that's great but you're exactly right it's that it's that continuous coverage that these devices give you uh and that's why they're the top three yeah so i hope this has been helpful we do have a lot of information on our site at technorv.com we've got information guides you can go to our articles sections we're all about giving lots of information out to make sure our viewers are educated on this type thing so we've talked a lot about a lot of great products and so uh i wanted to kind of close to say that you know at technorv.com which is the company that that we own because not only are we full-time rvers we do rv uh that you can get all of these products at technology.com we've got a lot of information on our site um from information guides to uh articles that we've written and then of course we've got our youtube channel with a lot of a lot of videos um as well just kind of

some construction going on across the street but that is okay you see we got the techno rv sign and uh we are about to give you what i would call the official techno rv tour and uh because many others have come through and given the tour and they've all been spectacular but uh now we get to do it so we're here this is the front door welcome welcome to technoharmony [Music] much easier to hear you in here yeah this is much nicer so uh when you come in the front door this is like a little sitting area i guess uh like just an entrance room i think it's called a lobby a lobby so we have not had time to even like put pictures up we've got these grand plans that this is going to look really cool in here one day but it doesn't look so cool right now but it does have a couch for somebody to sit on and if a customer were to come by we even got a little table we can hang out a customer came by today actually they sure did and they sat right there that is where they sat so uh this room right here is so the first two rooms are still under construction right the lobby is not completed and then this room is not completed we're to get the good stuff here a little bit but uh what we're going to do in this room is we're going to set up a demo room so we'll take a bunch of our products and we'll we'll set them up and then if we have customers come by then we'll be able to demonstrate them we kind of let them put their hands on the product and we've never had that before right and so it'll be nice and then they won't have to go all the way back to the warehouse and get in all that they can actually see what we carry without having to you know right exactly so uh really excited about this so i hope we can get this up and go on i do too so as we turn the corner every office needs a break room and we have one complete with a dishwasher and the berkey we got anybody got a berkey in their rv we do we have one in the rv and in the off of course and uh so anyway not much to see here but uh everything that one might expect in a uh break room is in that breaker tammy's office where all the real work gets done oh yeah so tammy has her own office and uh doesn't look like i do much that you see from the board well you know that used to have all their business plans on oh i just erased them like this morning just erased them you just missed all my business plans but your chair looks comfortable and um so anyway this is where tammy gets her work done and then the next office which is a big change actually us not working like two feet from each other yeah so i wonder whose office this is i wonder what is this the corner office with the big window so anyway this is my office uh and it doesn't look like a whole lot of work gets done here either but it does i get my work done and uh so when we're in town anyway this is our offices when we happen to be in town and we're not out on the road rv um so let's go down the hall because we're about to get into what i would consider the good stuff so this is the operations manager's office and he must be in the back he's working on operations yes that's where all the important stuff happens here and uh his name is derek and i'm guessing we'll run into him i'm sure we will on the tour uh if you ever come by and you have to use the restroom look at that you have restaurants imagine that okay no office is complete without a conference room right yeah this has been nice to have when we first got it i was like what are we going to do really with this but we've already used it with the training session yeah we do we've already done many training sessions we actually had a surge guard in last week to do a training session right our people and uh we've got all kinds of training sessions set up and we can have uh we've already had lots of meetings with this is where i had the goodies too this is where i had all the goodies where they coming no they're not hitting everybody trusts me everybody but uh and then we got the big tv with the camera so that when we're out of town uh out on the road and we want to conference in with the team then this is the space to do i think this is like a 14 foot it's nice we we fill it up when everybody's in here though yeah when everybody's in here it is so okay all right the next area well okay before we go into customer service uh we do have a mini little workout room yeah we do this was a request by a few of our employees they were like man it'd be great if we're on break if we got some high energy employees obviously room we could go into and uh burn off a little steam so uh stationary bike we're gonna get some little weights and stuff they have a vr set though that they rock climb and stuff with i haven't done it yet have you yeah so yeah if this door is closed they say it's off-limits across the hall here is every office has got like a bits and pieces room otherwise known as the junk room other yeah and so this is this is our bits and pieces room so uh anyway not a lot to see nope but it's got room for growth which is what we like because you know if we continue to grow we have some offices that can be converted from a bits and pieces room to an actual office this is correct okay we're about to get to the exciting stuff so everybody knows that customer service is kind of our thing and uh and we couldn't do that without great people in the customer service department so down this hall is where all these great people are so let's go check them out have we told them we're doing this no we have not told them i feel like we're surprising them this is michael hello and uh and so uh michael has been here a few months and is quickly becoming the product expert and uh yeah [Laughter] and then uh maybe you called in and talked to evan and then and then just worked out see see people use it on the treadmill or climbing or whatever you did uh kickboxing for 10 minutes and then um three miles on the bike wow okay that's sweet we're actually using that there you go good so well i know she makes me feel lazy just another perk of the technical rv office and then if you've called in and talked to allison we're going to sneak around here when are you working out today allison have you worked so anyway this uh we'll let y'all get back to it yeah so as everybody knows customer service is super important to us and they're the ones that uh make it happen so we're glad that you got to meet everybody and this is our server room and uh really nothing to really get into here there's a lot of brains of the operation back here besides your brains of the operation i'm not even about to start explaining it okay all right now that was three thousand square feet of office space and as promised we have three thousand square feet of warehouse space and uh because shipping accuracy and uh the speed at which we ship is also very important to our business model and that all happens through this door right here and everybody in this area loves to be on camera so where are they they're all running they're scattering what are they doing did we not tell them either i don't think we do uh so anyway this is this is the warehouse it's 3 000 square feet as i said and so basically orders will come in to uh our printing station over here and then this is where all of our product is and we'll we'll kind of tour all all of this i hear some giggling going on somewhere we're about to go fine now and uh and so then after the orders are printed then they are picked and put on the conveyor belt over here and then once they are picked then they uh come down here below the conveyor belt and then they are they are packed and so that is the process we have uh the absolute best warehouse employees of the entire united states absolutely and who was that who would say this is christie by the way this is christy she does she warehouse that's right roll tide raw of course of course uh let's see here who do we have here oh cha-cha and uh oh derek remember uh derek was not in his office and i presumed he was doing something important exactly and see he's doing operations like you said helping build boxes because we are all a big team here and uh when one department needs help we jump right to it which is what he said uh so this is all of our our racks with all of our products so surge guards on the front row we've got all of our sort of staying connected uh products on the second row with our our reboost and pep wave products and our wi-fi boosters this row with all of our tire pressure monitoring systems uh you know tst and tire monitor brands and then we have our propane safety devices the gas stop and garmin way back there and then our garmin gps's and then when we get here we've got our berkeys which you saw in our break room and the vision works uh rear observations yeah the new cameras right here and then uh bye ears here and then of course we have pallets of pie ears over here yeah the big ones we keep on pallets and then soft start soft starts and spark plug and smart plug yes and so uh what happens is once they're packed then right when we walked in you see all of the rolling racks with all the boxes completed on them and then so that's ups usps and fedex they all come pick up every day and then we'll just roll them to these roll-up doors here and then they just pull up and take them out so we have our cut off time is two o'clock every day so usually about two o'clock well not usually every day about seven two o'clock uh everything in here is done and then it's uh kind of prep clean up get ready for the for the next day to do it all over again and i think we're missing one we are missing we are missing taylor taylor's not getting out of there baylor is does most of our printing and so ah here she is uh this is hey hey taylor so she does a lot of our printing and computer work what do we got going on here product testing product testing there you go okay there you go so uh she does excellent at that and so thank you and so that kind of rounds out the warehouse area uh we could show them the parking lot back area that we're going to be working on let's go check that out good gracious it's bright out here so uh plenty of parking for know the employees and everybody here and then we have this this uh big back line and eric right now it's kind of a parking lot it's not really anything but we are gonna uh lay dirt and level it out and then put a bunch of limestone back here so if we're coming through uh town and uh we could put back here and although we've had a lot of guests that have come in vehicles it would be a place to turn around if it was just like i'm dropping by and i do have the rv you could make the loop and turn around back here yes if somebody came by here in the rv then absolutely they wouldn't get stuck no because we have 18 wheelers and everything else coming up in here so this one this is done for an rv it would be nothing to make the turn here so uh anyway that is the office compliments of course hey we hope you enjoyed our tour and just to let you know we are in the county of mobile alabama it's actually a theodore alabama address and uh you know what if you happen to be coming through the area and you want to stop by to uh see the place you're welcome to do so yeah we're right off i-10 right right off the i-10 yep on rain off of rangeline road and so uh it might be a good idea to maybe shoot an email into us or uh even call to let us know uh that you're you're coming by just in case uh because sometimes me and tammy are here which we don't have to be here for you to come by especially if you if a lot of times people order something they just want to come pick something up that's not a problem because you'll work through customer service on that anyway we hope you enjoy the tour and we will see you down the road", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2021-04-07T19:09:07Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title":

{"id": "VOhomwfVHiE", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "b7MTRxFGnFrwHBmogrnYHGCFSfg", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and this is the learning series video for your new vision works backup camera whether you've got the five inch seven inch or nine inch screen this learning series is going to work for you as it relates to the install so the short version of this is you're going to have a monitor and then you're going to have a backup camera you need to get power to both of those mount them turn them on and they're already paired and synced with each other and so they're just going to work so this is going to be real simple and what i thought i would do is just start with each component and talk about each component sort of separately and and then we'll also take a look at the install that i have already done on my travel trailer so you can sort of see what that looks like so let's start with your your camera here this is a a sony camera metal case it's extremely durable and you are gonna love it so what you have here is uh the obviously the the power connection is on the back of the camera and you're gonna need to get get power to that so when you ordered this you selected the type of mount that you wanted uh you either had neat wanted the furion mount the voyager mount or you got a universal mount so that is the voyager mount and this is the universal mount and this is the furion mount which is what we're going to be working with today so let's say you chose the furion this means that you've got an rv that's pre-wired so you'll have something that looks sort of like that on the on the back upper part of your rv and uh you're just going to take that off of your rv and then what you're going to see is an exposed wire there that is designed to connect to this camera here so we've got a couple of options here as it relates to getting this camera power so what i would do is i would take uh the wiring and run it through the hole of this bracket here and then you'll notice as it comes up close to the camera there's a weather button here that's going to seal seal that hole there and then if you have the furion pre-wire your kit is going to come with an adapter for that right so uh this is just going to connect to this part of the camera and then this part will connect right into the wire that comes out of your rv and it just connects in just like that now when i did my install uh the the tolerance on the wire that was coming out on the furion was uh uh it was too tight for for this to fit well i knew i was going to do a hard wire install anyway but the vision work uh kit comes with also a hardwire connection so you would just connect this here and then the wiring that comes out of your rv you're just going to connect it permanently it's just a red and a black wire you connect those together so you can get that done now the one thing that you need to be testing is that in most cases the power is going to be given to that wire that is pre-wired to your rv when the marker lights are turned on and so in order for this system uh to become live when you take off for a trip you just need to make sure your marker lights are turned on i've heard some rare cases where they that some wired it into like reverse lights to where it only comes on when you put it in reverse so if that's the case and you want it on all the time then you're going to need to connect it to a steady 12 volt power source but again in most cases it is connected to the uh the marker lights so you're going to have a antenna that you're going to need to screw onto the back of the camera here so we will just do that and then the viewing angle is sort of set up for you here on this because as you start to slide this in here and you're going to have a little baggie of uh of screws uh here to secure this to the bracket but you'll see that if this was on the back of the rv the viewing angle is sort of set because the antenna comes up here and just rests on the back of that bracket giving you that perfect viewing angle out back so anyway that is the basics of the camera now let's take a look at the monitor all right let's look at the monitor here and the install just keeps getting easier by the way so uh here is your monitor you'll have a antenna that you will screw into the top of the monitor here there's a uh like a screen protector on here and it is uh if if you have polarized sunglasses and and you sort of know how that works they're either polarized horizontally or vertically so when you look at a screen that's uh polarized in a certain orientation it could black out the screen so when you get this you get it turned on and all working i just want to remind you just don't take this this protector off yet right so put your glasses on and when you get everything fired up i see it like just super brilliant but whenever i go to take this off of here it changes that orientation to where then i i don't see it like that so test which is right for you either it stays on or it comes off so all we got to do is get power to this and mount it and they've given you a couple of power options here the easiest is a 12 volt power supply so you just plug that into it plug it into your cigarette lighter right so that makes that easy and then they also give you this ac power supply same thing you just plug it in here now this could be uh if you have a truck or a motorhome that has an ac power supply that you want to use this otherwise i would just use the 12 volt power source but if you want to use this monitor and camera system as a security system maybe after hours because it does have a slot for a sd card and you can record uh on this so what some people choose to do is to maybe move this monitor maybe back to their bedroom of their rv and plug it in so you've got some options here as it relates to power as far as mounting you've got three options that came with your system here one is more of a permanent style mount and this basically is just going to you'll have some screws that will mount around the the monitor here and then you would just mount that to maybe your your dash or wherever you would like to mount it the other option is a suction cup mount and on the back of your monitor you'll see there's like this little track and then the suction cup mount basically slides onto that track and then you can tighten it down in any orientation that you would like another option that you have that comes with your kit is this nice cupholder mount and i think a lot of people are going to choose to use this if they have a cup holder in the right right place but you just set this down your cup holder and then down at the base you just turn turn this little collar right here and you can see these three points start coming out to tighten it into the cup holder and then and then you can move this around in any orientation that you want and then of course this uh just pops right in there like that now i will say if you've got the nine inch kit you do not get the the cup holder mount with that because the nine inch screen is too big to fit into this but but you do have the suction cup and the the more permanent uh style mount there so anyway that is is uh the basics of just sort of the install on the the monitor and again these are prepared whenever you get a kit and you give the both of these power it's just going to pop up on the screen and you're going to be good to go so what i thought i would do here is show the the camera that i have installed on the back of my travel trailer and show you uh what that looks like all right this is on the back of our uh forest river rockwood mini light and so uh i jumped the gun here a little bit and did a few things for uh we did the videoing here so i'm sorry about that but you as you know there was like a furion like dummy bracket right here and you just need to take that off there's four screws that go into the back of your rv there and then what you'll find is that there's a wire there for you and uh but that wire and then this where i kind of jumped the gun because i already clipped it but the wire basically had that tip on it here and then if you were to use the the fury furion adapter that came with your kit then you would basically just plug i'm sorry here you would basically just plug that in right and then your camera here you would then just plug the other end into that and then shove all the wiring back into your rv and then mount it now i hardwired this and so this also comes with the kit and so i clipped off that piece and stripped back the wires the red and black wires here and then of course this kit comes with the red and black wires here that you're just going to connect and then the other end then it'll connect to the camera now what this gives me the ability to do is uh i don't need all this this length here so i'm going to end up just cutting this off about right here and then hard wiring it to the wire from the rv and so i'm going to go ahead and do that and then uh and then we'll come back and sort of finish this up okay just going to strip these back and looks like it's on number 16 on my stripper here if that means anything to you there we go and i have a couple of uh wire screws here and i'm just going to connect them i made it sort of compact here because again once us once i put this in here at least on this rv there's not a lot of room there's a lot of insulation in here and so i made these these real tight so you can figure that out on your install and now i'm going to get some electrical tape and uh and secure that with electrical tape electrical tape always a good idea especially when it's behind the walls okay what i've done is i've cut off a lot of the wiring because again i don't have a lot of room to work back here to shove this stuff back up in here uh but anyway at the end of the day i have already got uh my wiring run through the bracket like i showed you earlier and i've already got the screws here on the side of the camera in place and so it is really just about plugging this in now before i do that i do want to point out that right there the of course this is your power connection here this right here is a pairing wire it's actually a button that you press if this were to ever become uh not paired for some reason then there is a pairing sequence that you go into the monitor you go into pairing mode and then within 20 seconds of going into pairing mode you need to press that button in and hold it until it syncs back up with the monitor and so it's real easy to do but again with your new install this stuff's all uh paired and ready to go so again all we're doing here is we're just plugging the unit in here and and then we're going to push the wiring into the rv and again i hope you have more room to work with than i do because it is tight in here now before i put all this in um and screw this back on here uh we're gonna make sure that uh this works so let's go ahead and turn the monitor on take a peek at it okay uh before you screw the bracket back onto the back of your rv uh you know you need to test it like we just did and so uh that's why the marker lights are on because the marker lights gave it power and you need to make sure that that's what's giving it power and uh and from here i saved you the the visual of me uh shoving all this wiring in here again i didn't have a lot of room i hope hope you have a little more room but these are the things you got to work through whenever you're doing your own install and so it's all pushed in and then basically i'm just going to uh i've got four screws that the mount that came with the vision works perfectly fits with this furion setup and so that is uh what it is going to look like when it is complete and uh ready to go all right and that does it and this has got a great gasket on the the back side of that so just get a feel of that and you may consider putting some caulking around here to make sure that it's completely weatherproof here but that is the finished product and we've about run out of daylight here so let's go take one more peek at the monitor and make sure everything's working okay it is actually already entered into night vision mode and so you can see uh we were pretty much running out of daylight out there but you can see how great it looks at night time so it is installed on our forest river the monitor works great and we're ready to go rving", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2021-02-17T15:26:44Z", "channelId":

{"id": "B5XaGiN3eGo", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "M26w9o9HMeA11t__IckkIQEBYhc", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and in this video i'm going to tell you everything that you need to know about the pep wave max br1 mk2 and i've got one right here we're going to take a look at it and talk about all of its features uh the first thing to know is that this is a cellular embedded router and it is a cat 6 and it's a dual band wi-fi out of the box and i'm going to explain what all that means this is the main engine of the unit right here this is the router and these things are built like a tank they are industrial strength and they have been certified and tested to take a lot of shock and vibration abuse because again these are actually used in industry so we actually get the advantage of that on the rv side and it can be a little bumpy driving down the road in the rv so it's good that these things are built for that so let's talk about the measurements on this unit right here so it is a 5.5 inches across it is so 5.8 inches 5 inches right here and then the height of it is 1.6 inches so pretty compact right and so let's talk about this whole cat 6 thing that means category 6 and it is the reason that this unit has excellent throughput speeds and just so that you know theoretical speeds on this unit right here is 300 megabits per second download and 50 megabits per second upload i say theoretical because there are a lot of other things that can affect uh throughput and speed this unit's capable of doing that whether or not the local cell tower that you're connected to is capable of that who knows also you know you got to count in obstructions between you and the tower and other things that can affect signal that also can affect speed but this can certainly handle it itself the category six part of this means and and it's part of the reason that it it is so fast is that category six means that it has what's called carrier aggregation and that means that this particular model can connect to two frequency bands at one time to give you better throughput so having the ability to merge two bands together is incredible technology that you will get with the cat6 modems now you may hear of you know cat 12 and cat 18 it just means more carrier aggregation the cat 12s can connect to three frequency bands at one time and the cat 18s can do up to five so again we're talking about cat6 it can connect to up to two and that's why you get those great speeds out of the box it's got a great transmitter and great antenna power so if you're used to like a a jet pack like this just like out of the box this one's gonna immediately outperform it because of its increased transmitter and antenna power it can make all the difference in the world okay so let's talk about the antennas that you get on this unit here and so you're going to get multiple cellular antennas and what that means is that out of the box this is considered a memo device multiple in multiple out you may have heard that terminology before and let me break that down for you a little bit imagine trying to communicate with a source with one antenna and as the single antenna is creating waves and moving to the point of communication maybe there's obstructions in the way there's a building there's some trees there's you're in a valley whatever it is all of these things can create breaks and errors in that communication as it goes and comes back to you so it makes sense that you would have more than one antenna thus the memo technology so that you have two antennas at the same time going and grabbing that information it can reduce those errors and what that means for you is that you're going to have a much better experience and better throughput so on this device you'll just see a mainsail and then and then there's a secondary cell and you just screw these paddle antennas on like this super easy to do they fold up like this they're kind of cool looking these big paddles here and they really do pack the power i mean let's think about this i mean if if you just add uh even just a few db of gain to uh to antennas versus uh system that doesn't have that like like this unit right here actually has ports that i can connect uh a memo antenna to but it's not memo out of the out of the box right and so having the ability to add decibel gain to your antenna ports can i mean depending on the the amount of gain that it is i mean two decibel gain could increase your throughput and your signal strength by uh 50 anyway there's your cellular ones here okay i mentioned to you this is a dual band wi-fi dual band meaning it can connect to the 2.4 gigahertz band and it can connect to the five gigabit gigahertz band 2.4 being great for long distances and uh and fast right and then the five gigahertz being better for or operates better with shorter distances but it is faster right it just can't communicate as far so having both of those is great and again out of the box if you've looked at my video on the br1 mini the br1 mini out of the box does not have wi-fi it's a it's an additional charge to activate the ability to pick up wi-fi right and then even when you do that it's only 2.4 gigahertz with the with the this unit right here you are getting wi-fi out of the box and both bands 2.4 and 5 gigahertz so this is uh this is great stuff here so let's move on to this other antenna that you'll see in this box is a gps antenna now you don't have to use this if you don't want to all it's going to do is tell you where your device is so it will log this information for a period of time and so you know if you want to know where you were at last week specifically by gps location then you could pull that all up on the the back end portal anyway it's just a connection point and you will see that there is a connection point on the router that says gps you would just screw this in now as it relates to a gps antenna it's always good to get that having direct sight to the sky right so if you wanted to use this you could certainly try this by maybe putting it up in your dash or in a window of your rv but the recommended uh method for this is that you would need to put this on your uh roof so you can try it out how you want it is available i'm not going to hook that up right now so we got to get this thing powered up and out of the box this comes with a wall outlet plug with a little barrel connector here a little push in and uh and you'll see back here on the back it operates from 10 to 30 volts dc you just plug that in here plug it into a wall outlet and you are off and running now what we've done is we wanted to have you have the ability to also connect this hard wire to a dc source or even like with a cigarette lighter so when you get this from techno rv we actually include a hard wire kit and you'll see a terminal block here on the back that you would hardwire into here and then directly to a dc power source in addition we are also including the cigarette lighter style plug here which really makes it easy and then again it's got the the just the regular plug in where you normally plug the wall outlet in you would now just plug that in and it will work fine so you get three power sources when you get it from us here at techno rv so you will never be wondering how to power this unit so this unit is compatible with verizon at t t-mobile sprint all the big guys and again you're going to bring your own data plan uh to the table here and then pepwave will do the rest so you can it actually has multiple sim card slots and it takes full size sim cards in this unit and so whatever plan you have or that you need to go get you you'll just it just needs to be a plan that's designed for a router for example if you've ever had one of these these have sim cards in them that are designated router plans so the sim card that would work in something like this would be the same sim card that you could actually pull out of this and put into a unit like this or you can just go to like the other day i went to the t-mobile store and i just told them that i wanted currently at the time of this video they have like a 100 gig plan for 50 bucks which is a great deal and so i told them i wanted that plan but i didn't need a device and they basically handed me a sim card that it was just loaded with that uh that data plan already on it now you can as i said uh put two different plans in here but it is a single single modem here so it can't use both of them at the same time but you know if you had maybe one plan that was available for high data use maybe that you had and you wanted one that maybe was a lower uh data use that you could kind of use as a backup or something like that then that would be the purpose for that it also has failover capabilities which means that if if your sim card in one let's say the tower that you're on fails that it can move you to the other connection automatically right now the regular failover that comes with this even though it's automatic you still might see a break in like let's say you're watching a movie and it freezes up because your cellular connection froze up it'll start the process of moving it over when it sees that but it it may take a bit i'm going to talk about hot fail over here in a little bit where it's more instantaneous and that's something that you can get with this device as well the wi-fi range just within your rv or boat or whatever you're in is excellent a lot of times when you're using these little jet packs if it's at the front of the rv and you're in the back your signal strength can be poor this really puts the heat to it and really makes a great zone you know within your rv you're going to always have good signal strength within your rv another thing to point out is you on the back of the unit you do have lan and wan port so let me explain those real quick when wide area network is and i'm explaining this is if because most people can relate to having a home that maybe you have comcast or mediacom or something like that the internet provider and then you have an ethernet cable in your home that plugs into like your router and then that router rebroadcast the wi-fi within your home same thing here the wan port is an input from a hard line sourced through ethernet now you're on a boat or you're in an rv chances are most of the time you're never going to have access to that right that's why we're out there so that we are sort of disconnected and that's why we need things to more be wireless but if you found yourself in a situation that you did have access to that then you could use it the lan port is basically an output connection ethernet to where you can plug this unit directly into like your computer typically a direct wired connection is better than a wireless connection so if you were using say verizon here instead of wirelessly connecting your computer to this device you could hardwire connect it with an ethernet cable now because wan is most of the time not going to be used for rvers and boaters you can reassign that way in port to be another lan port now that that you might use right because maybe you got uh two computers or something that you want to direct connect to this there's a lot of flexibility with this unit and i just i'm just trying to point out here to you so that you sort of know how flexible it is and how customizable it is all right let's talk about something called speed fusion and this is something that you can activate with uh with this unit right here when you buy this unit you get one year of something called essential care that's your one year warranty uh that you get and it is also um your your updates and and and your uh support through uh through pep link they've got like a ticket system which we're going to support you as well but they do have it available like that and uh and also this speed fusion and so there are there's three elements to speed fusion and there is something called hot failover wand smoothing and bonding because this is a single uh modem they didn't design this to do the bonding side of things which is basically taking multiple sources of internet combining them together and then giving you more throughput if you're interested in more information about that or a unit that actually can do that then you need to be looking at the dual modem the mac transit max transit duo units that we sell but with the speed fusion activated on this you do get the hot failover and what that means is that all available resources that you have pulling in internet which could be uh you know a cellular connection through your data data card and it could be it could be two sources of wi-fi because you have 2.4 and 5 here and what that means is that let's say you're on a zoom call and it's super important that this does not get interrupted then you could set up the hot failover during that call and if one of those sources dropped out in an instant it would put you on another source and i mean in an instant to where it's an unbreakable connection to where you would never even see a blip in the zoom call or a video or whatever it is you got going on so hot failover is spectacular and you can get that by activating the speed fusion with this unit right here also the wand smoothing is pretty awesome too what that means is that again all available resources cellular two wi-fi connections what it does is if it's activated it will whenever you initiate a request for internet it will send out packets to all available resources and for a lack of a better term on how to explain this whichever one of those resources responds the quickest does the best job on getting the information back that's the one that basically gets the job right so if you're on a zoom call and you have the wind smoothing on and say you've got verizon and two wi-fi sources connected into the unit it's constantly doing that in the background it's nothing that you need to know is going on you just know what's going on right and so at the end of the call maybe it's a 30 minute call you might have done some of that call on verizon or at t whatever your card is some of that call may have been coming through the one of the wi-fi connections and it's just constantly pinging constantly pinging and getting the best sources and providing that to you and it's all seamless to you so when smoothing is pretty awesome and and you can get that by activating the speed views fusion that you get for a year through the essential care so again with the essential care that's your one year warranty that you get with this unit it is uh the the speed fusion and your your updates and all that so i want to talk now about some external antenna options that you will have uh when you go to the product pages of all of our pep wave devices we have the recommended outside antenna that would match up perfectly with the particular unit that you're looking for and then you would just choose if you want to get that now out of the box of course you're getting these internal antennas and they work great and you will definitely see a lot of imperformance improvements over say like just a regular jetpack now outside's always better right line of sight's better and typically these antennas uh will just have more decibel gain which is going to bring in the signal better and give you better throughput speeds so the one the outside antenna the omnidirectional outside antenna that we recommend is the puma two two one it's a omnidirectional antenna it's a five in one antenna which means that there's basically five cables all wrapped up into one right but we need to talk about what these five connection points are uh so that uh so that you know and it's basically all the connection points we've talked about here you've got two cellular right so you would just unscrew these two and connect these you've got two wi-fi so now you're unscrewing these and plugging this in then of course you've got your gps this unit right here is something that you could permanently mount on the roof of your rv you can do it or you can get a rv tech or somebody that maybe is experienced in installing satellite dishes or something like that to do it and uh and then once that's up there and plugged in then it's just gonna be working this provides up to seven decibel game increase so i say up to seven because depending on what frequency uh it's reaching out to across the cellular bands some may be a little bit lower than seven some are right at seven and also the same thing for the wi-fi bands as well but you get up to seven which like the number seven just like doesn't seem like a lot but as it relates to this it's a lot i mean you can see some massive gains by applying this antenna to this equation so the point here is this like as an rv or a boater we're traveling around all over the place right and so some places where uh might have better experiences uh you know without having to have an outside antenna and then sometimes we're at places where we're maybe we're just so far from the tower so if you can do it and again you don't have to install this on day one but i do encourage you to get an outside antenna and then and then you can figure out like the timing on uh getting that installed by yourself or a tech the other antenna that you might want to consider we do have a directional antenna it's called the pointing uh x-pole antenna i'm just gonna reach over here grab this now this is directional now right so this is one direction so you gotta point it in the direction of where the cell tower is it is just a two in one right so this is only for your cellular connection so it would just plug into these two uh ports here and oftentimes a directional antenna can outperform a omnidirectional antenna because you you eliminate a lot of noise from the 360 degree direction and you're just focused in one direction so but they're also a little bit more of a pain because you at each location you gotta aim it towards the cellular tower i'm more of an omnidirectional uh kind of person but i know there's a lot of of techie people out there that much prefer a directional antenna so you pick what's right for you if you're not sure you're probably an omnidirectional type type person the other thing that we have under this listing is just extension cables for the outside antennas so you can look up on the listings and just see the links of all the different cables that come on these antennas here and then see hey if i'm going to install this wherever this is going to land is that enough cable or do i need an extension here let's talk about pricing now so uh it's i'm shooting this video in january of 2021 and the uh the the mk2 is is priced at 5.99 and uh and then your puma 221 antenna is 199. the x-pole is 196 and then you can get different size extension cables but you know they're going to be 90 100 bucks maybe a little bit north of 100 bucks on that so as you can see if you think about if you've watched the video on the br1 where it's it's it's 399 but it doesn't come with the wi-fi and to get wi-fi on that when you pay another 100 bucks now you're up to 4.99 but it's only single band wi-fi 2.4 for 5.99 you can get this one and it's dual band wi-fi in addition to of course your cellular so that's it that's the mk2 and you can get it over at technorv.com and don't forget when you buy it from us we're

{"id": "eiPiqTP0uxU", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "ashUTgM9SnysGYD1WscC_iE5aMg", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and in this video i'm going to tell you everything that you need to know about the pep wave br1 mini cellular embedded router so i've got one right here we're going to unbox it and show you everything that you get in it and go over the details about what you're getting not just physically but what these units are capable of doing this br1 mini is a cat 6 cellular modem and what that means that the cat6 just means category 6. so there's different levels the higher category you go the faster throughput speeds that you can get through different routers and so cat6 is a good one because it means that you're going to have something that's called two times carrier aggregation and what that means is that you can have access to multiple cellular frequency bands at one time so cat 4 and before that model you could only connect to one frequency band so when you get to a cat 6 model like this br1 mini this now has the ability to connect to two bands why this is important is because if you can only connect to one say you're on a verizon network and you can only connect to one network or one frequency band what if that frequency band is like overloaded and crowded and the bandwidth is just poor you're sitting there you're having a bad experience if you had a cat six modem in that same scenario to where you were able to pull in bandwidth from two different frequencies at the same time it's highly likely that one of those other frequencies is much less loaded down and because of that you're going to get faster speeds and believe me it is something that is recognizable over over say your standard your standard jetpack so this unit right here measures uh 4.3 inches here it's 4.1 inches here and the height on it is about 1.2 inches these do come with a one-year warranty by the way and this unit can handle up to 60 users don't know anybody that's really going to need that many users in their rv but it does have the capability for that the theoretical speeds that you can get on a a cat 6 router like this is 300 megabits per second down and uh 50 megabits per second upload that's fast so the reason i say theoretical is because this has the ability to do it but then there's other factors involved that would probably keep you from getting that of course like what is the cell tower even going to provide signal strength from you to the cell tower the further you get away maybe there's obstructions between you and the cell tower there's a lot of things that can affect that but it is nice to know that this unit has the ability to really crank out uh the speeds and considering that uh that you know you can watch a high definition movie at i don't know four to six megabits per second you know what you're going to get out of this is going to be going to be plenty and it is certainly what we have seen out in the field so let's dig into the antennas real quick here and try and be neat here as i go through this so you'll have two cellular antennas that come with this unit and on the back of the unit here you'll see main cellular and and then another cellular connection here having two antennas means that out of the box this is a memo device which means multiple in and multiple out which means you just have multiple antennas to get the job done why is this important well let's say you're just using a single antenna to try and communicate with another point uh and those waves and everything as it goes out to communicate are hitting obstructions like trees maybe you're in a valley there's all these different things that can be going on so that can start to create errors in those waves by having more antennas involved going out and grabbing that signal it can reduce the number of those errors and what that means for you is uh faster speeds right so multiple in multiple out memo it is included with this and the antennas do come with that so as it relates to cellular uh you bring your your sim card with your cellular plan to this like a sim card is designed to be in a router uh like one that you might have in your like in a jet pack that you have right and so this unit actually has two slots for multiple sim cards but it is a single modem so it can only use one of those at a time but you can use this unit to sort of manage your way between a couple of different cell plans and there's all kinds of different ways that you can say hey on this sale plan when i get to this many gigs swap over this one there's just a lot of uh customizable functions that you get with this device that is going to make that a lot easier now as it relates to wi-fi out of the box this has the ability to have wi-fi is weighing which is basically connecting to say a campground's wi-fi it it has that ability but there is a there is a failover fee of 100 that you would need to pay to activate uh the wi-fi side of things and that failover license and it's a one-time fee of a hundred dollars it not only opens up the wi-fi but it also opens up your wan port what when is is you'll probably be able to relate to that better as just thinking about your router in your house so maybe you have comcast cable or mediacom or whatever coming into your your home and then you'll have an ethernet cable that you're plugging into your router and then it rebroadcasts in your house right that's called a wan port so it's a hard line ethernet connection that can be plugged in now out of the box you basically have two ethernet ports right here and out of the box they're both designated as lan ports what lan is that's more of an ethernet out function to where say you're getting a cellular signal through this router and you want to hardwire connection with an ethernet cable to your computer typically a hard wire connection is going to give you a better experience so if you can do that and you don't mind the cable then then you can hardwire connection so out of the box both of these ports are designated as land so outs to maybe a couple of computers right if you get the failover license then this port right here turns into a wan port if you had a direct connect from an outside source rvers probably are never going to have that right so you can you can uh just toggle on the the back end um of the portal to make keep that as a lan port so really what you're getting with the failover license that most people would use is the ability to connect to campground wi-fi so you would just have another antenna that comes with your unit and you would screw this on to your unit like that and if you purchase the failover license of a hundred bucks and that's for for a lifetime you would then open up the weigh-in port and your wi-fi connection that can be good for a few reasons so let's talk about it uh if let's say you have a a data plan that maybe you're trying to conserve the data on it right and you mainly stay at like campgrounds you can set the the primary connection on this to get campground wi-fi and as you know that that can be good at times and then maybe it cannot be good at times so you can just set it the primary to connect to the campground wi-fi and if that becomes unacceptable then you can always fail over to your cellular connection so that would reduce your data load on your your plan which is always a good thing as it relates to cellular it can handle all of the major cellular providers att verizon t-mobile sprint and uh but it does it it does take a full-size sim card and i do want to point out that it needs to be a sim card that is designed for a a router so like a sim card that would go into again like a jet pack like this would certainly work on this you start pulling sim cards out of phones and and other type devices and that uh could be a hit or miss thing so just to play it safe it's always good to just get one get a sim card and plan that is designed for a router and that's easy enough to do by going to your local verizon at t t-mobile store the other thing that you have on this device is you have a gps connection right here and so you'll have a gps antenna in here i'm not sure a lot of people are going to use this from from day one but what it's going to do it's going to tell you where your cellular router is so it does hold some of this information on the on the back end portal so you know if you're wondering where you were specifically exactly last week you could go pull it up you know i suppose if your rv got stolen or something like that it would be good to know where it's at and if this was connected then you would certainly uh have that so this just connects into this gps port right here and then you've got a cable that it's gonna be of course better for a gps antenna that you have clear line of sight to the sky so you could certainly try this by putting it out and maybe uh your front window ideally yes it would be better to just put it up on the roof of your rv but you can test that out and see what what works for you there as it relates to power you do have a few power options here and this is just going to be a regular wall adapter right here on uh the unit here and it comes with this the the power the dc power rating is from 12 to 28 volts and so it comes with this wall plug that you can just plug this barrel connector in and plug it straight into a wall outlet and then it's also got this this dc uh block here that you can hard wire into a dc power support and when you go to check out at techno rv you'll notice that we actually include a fused hard wire kit when you purchase this from us and in addition we also include with this a cigarette lighter style adapter with the barrel connector that can plug in right where your wall outlet unit connected to so we give you three options that's kind of an exclusive thing for techno rv we give you three options for power you got your wall outlet you're gonna have your hard wired kit and you're gonna have your cigarette lighter barrel style adapter right here another thing that you get uh with the br1 mini is that you get something called essential care basically what essential care is it gives you your your one year warranty it gives you access one year access to something called in control 2 which is kind of a a pep waves cloud-based version of how to monitor this unit there's all kinds of reporting and and people really tend to like it now if you didn't use in control 2 you can still control all of the functions with this by just logging into this router using a a 192 number that will explain in the techno rv learning series by the way so anything i'm talking about here as it relates to how to operate this unit we're going to make sure that you're taken care of also essential care is going to cover your your firmware updates and it's also going to cover certain elements of something called speed fusion now i want to be real careful with this one here because while you do have access to some of this there are some limitations as it relates to this unit as it relates to speed fusion so speed fusion has something in it that's called hot failover which means that if one connection is broken that it'll instantly go to another connection that you might have available in this case you would have a a sim card with a cellular provider right and then if you got that failover license to activate wi-fi on this unit so now you have a connection to a campground wi-fi and you have a connection to the local cellular carrier in that case it could do hot failover which means that if if you were say on wi-fi as your primary and it failed it would instantly and without a break in whatever you happen to be doing jump over to the cellular connection or it could do that vice versa as well so this is good for people that may be doing zoom calls and things for work that are extremely important that they have this unbreakable solution and that's what the pep wave is going to do without the failover license from the br mini one where you activate the wi-fi then the uh the hot failover there's nothing for it to fail over to them so i hope that makes sense the other thing that it can do is something called uh wand smoothing and this is part of the the speed fusion bundle of of products and again with wand smoothing you have to have that wi-fi because what it does is it takes the availability of multiple connections in this case it would be wi-fi and cellular and when you say start a zoom call it is going to simultaneously start sending packets of information to both sources your cellular and your wi-fi and for lack of better term whichever one does the better job for you that's the one that's going to get the job and so but it continuously does that so if you're on a 30-minute call some of that call might have been on wi-fi some of it might have been on cellular but it's all seamless to you you don't know this thing's just doing it in the background so that's part of that speed fusion thing this does not have the ability to bond the uh the wi-fi and the cellular together to increase bandwidth that's just not a feature of this particular product but that's okay so that is what uh that's what essential carry is and when you buy the br one mini from us here at technology you get that for a year and then after a year you would just pay a fee to continue it for the next year so let's now talk a little bit about outside antennas this works without an outside antenna so all these antennas come with it and you're gonna fire it up and you're gonna be uh really excited about its performance but just know as rvers uh boaters you're you're constantly moving in different situations you're closer to the cell tower you're further away all these different scenarios overall you're going to have better experiences if you made the decision to deploy an outside antenna like this puma 221 antenna right here so it's not something that that you know you have to do immediately but from my standpoint i do recommend that you get an outside antenna and make plans to get it put up whether this is something that you install or you get an rv tech to install but this is the puma 221 right here you can get up to 7 db gain increase with this unit uh and when i say up to seven it it it increases uh the gain different on different frequencies across the cellular bands and for wi-fi and with the br1 because i don't think i mentioned this and i should have it's a single band wi-fi which means you're going to have access to to the 2.4 band which is a great band it's a band that that operates great at further distances away but this is not a dual band wi-fi now we do have dual band wi-fi where you get access to the 2.4 and the five gigahertz wi-fi bands but again this is a single uh band here anyway the puma 221 this would be something that you would mount on the roof of your rv and it's called a five in one because there's basically five cables uh into one so you're gonna have two that are going to be your cellular connection so you would basically just unscrew these two paddle antennas and screw these in you're going to have two wi-fi's but because this is a single router uh then one of these is actually not going to be used you'll just use one of these and then you're going to have your your gps connection right here now if you if you up front did not activate the failover license to get wi-fi then both of these wi-fi connections would not be connected to this unit but we sell it with them because we feel like that even if you did not get the wi-fi immediately that down the road you might want it so if you had put this antenna up you just want the availability of it so that's the the puma 221 and uh it is a a great option the other thing that you'll see that we have as a recommendation is we do have the pointing antenna and this is a directional antenna and this is a two in one that uh that you can see here and this is for cellular only so this would be something that while the puma is omnidirectional it sees in all directions the the pointing x-pole is directional so you would need to point this into the direction of where the cell tower is and oftentimes a directional antenna can be great because it it basically eliminates other noise that might be coming from the 360 degrees and it just focuses in in one area so we do have those two options there that you can look at the other thing that we'll we'll have as an option is just extended length uh cable and so if the length of cable is not enough on these units and we'll have all that spelled out for you on our product page then you could always just buy more length of cable okay so let's round this out by talking about pricing and uh so the br1 mini i'm shooting this video in january of 2021 the br1 mini right now is set at 399 right so 399 so it's really a great price point i mean if you're just looking at it getting away from this and experiencing everything that this has to offer over and above this then you could just for 3.99 just make that happen right for another hundred dollars now we're at 499 you can activate that failover license which gives you access to the wi-fi connecting to like a local uh rv park so that's it 399 100 for the failover license which makes it 4.99 and then as far as these antennas are concerned the pepwave puma 221 here is uh it is a hundred and ninety nine dollars and if you're going to take that on it's worth every penny uh the x-pole directional antenna is 196.14 and then if you wanted some extension cables those can vary depending on the length of the cable but they could be anywhere from 90 to a little bit over 100 bucks so that kind of gives you an idea on the pricing of this so so that's it uh technorv.com is where you can see and get all this and in addition don't forget when you order

{"id": "aYUa4EWJ2Kg", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "mOn9vTbNGJB0518FnLODZsJsfXQ", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and in this video i'm going to tell you everything you need to know about the max transit duo by pep wave the cat 6 and cat 12 versions we're going to be talking about today so i've got one of them right here so i thought we would just start going through the box and then i'll tell you all about the features and make sure that you understand what you are getting here when you order one of these from techno rv so the measurements on all of this and the antennas that you get is all the same whether you get a category 6 or a category 12 modem so that's why i've only got one right here because uh visually they're going to be the same but i will explain the difference in the cat6 and cat 12 but first note the metal uh housing here this is industrial strength it is certified uh for certain levels of like vibration and uh because industry uses this like these are like really heavy duty units we just get the advantage of that on the rv side but driving the road down in an rv well that can get kind of bumpy at times too i'm sure you know what i mean this can handle that type of abuse so the cat 6 and cat 12 differences there so the differences are how many cellular bands can they connect to at one time that's the difference the more uh cellular frequency bands they can connect to at one time the higher their speed capabilities will be so you've got like cat 4 modems that can only connect to one cellular frequency at a time cat 6 is something that can connect to two cellular frequencies at one time and cat 12 can connect to three cellular uh frequencies at one time now these duos are they're they're duo because they're dual modems which means that you can put two different sim cards from different carriers in here and it can utilize the resources from those at the same time so that's pretty big news so uh the frequency and the in the carrier aggregation which is the part where you can connect to multiple frequency bands it's called carrier aggregation let's just think about that for one second before we move on let's say you can only connect to one frequency band like a cat 4 modem can well you could be connecting to verizon in a particular area and maybe let's just pretend it's got i don't know six or eight frequency vans available and you can only connect to one well what if you get connected to one that is overloaded your experience is going to be poor because of that if you're in a cat 6 modem now all of a sudden you can connect to multiple frequencies two of them so now if one of them is overloaded and and and you're you're happen to be connected to that and you're connected to another one that's not overloaded it'll pull the resources from both of those and give you one better experience than you could singularly with just one frequency the cat 12 same thing except now we're talking about three frequency bands so imagine this right uh you've got uh one band that's that's overloaded and crowded and the old person with the the cat 4 that's all they have access to but now you can get that and you can get some other frequency bands that that aren't overloaded and have more available bandwidth and speed brings it all together and presents you with a much better experience so with this carrier aggregation what this is going to mean for you is just faster theoretical speed so with a cat 6 modem the theoretical speed for a cat 6 is 300 megabits per second downloading 50 upload on a cat 12 modem uh your your theoretical download is 600 megabits per second and a hundred megabits per second up now why do i say theoretical because this pep wave can handle those numbers that i just gave you now there are other things at play that can affect the fact that you will likely never get those speeds at the max level and that could be that the cell tower is just not willing to give it or doesn't have the ability to give it at that level it could be that you have a lot of obstructions between you and the cellular tower that's creating interference so there's all sorts of things that can affect it but side by side a cat 4 a cat 6 a cat 12 modem if they're all in the same environment the 6 will outperform the 4 and the 12 will outperform the six so we'll just stick with that and let's think about it to run an hd movie what do you need like four to six megabits per second download so these units are really going to be able to put the power to it to be able to handle the consumption levels that uh that you're likely gonna have so let's start digging into the box here and getting some of these antennas out and what you're gonna have here because you've got two cellular modems built into one router you're going to have two antennas per modem for a total of four cellular antennas so this is what one of the cellular antennas looks like and your cellular connection points are just across the top here and they're labeled quite nicely for you and you just screw these on now i'm not going to screw all four of them on but you can pretend that i did uh but you would have four of them across uh here now because you have multiple antennas this means that you have built in memo multiple in multiple out you may have heard this term before and i want to explain it a little bit more in detail and tell you why it's it's so awesome let's say you only have a single antenna antenna you're not multiple in multiple out your single antenna that one antenna is trying to make a communication to uh the next point the next antenna the next tower whatever it is right and along the way it's going through trees there's buildings uh maybe there's a rainstorm whatever it is there's things that can interfere with that perfect connection and these things can create errors along the way uh to the uh the tower antenna and errors along the way back to where by the time you get it maybe it's not as fast as it could be right when you start adding multiple antennas now in this case per modum you have two antennas doing that job and so what it's going to do is it's going to reduce the errors in that communication and by reducing those errors you're going to get better performance and a better experience so that's why when you hear the term memo it's a good thing and it is built into this router right here also this router has dual band wi-fi so in here you'll also have some wi-fi antennas and you'll have two connection points here one's for the 2.4 and one is for the five gigahertz and this is good news because having access to both of them both of those frequencies uh depending on what area you're in like a lot of rv parks may just have 2.4 because typically 2.4 is it's going to do better in longer ranges where as five gigahertz is faster than 2.4 but it can't handle those long ranges like 2.4 kenneth it's more of a closer range type situation so the fact that you have both of them working simultaneously together because you may be in a place to where the the part has 2.4 and 5 gigahertz good you can connect to both of them and it'll utilize those resources together to present you with a better experience now the transmit power and the fact that you you're adding decibel gain with these antennas is it just means that you're going to have a better experience out of the box than say if you're using just a regular jet pack so like this one right here it it's it's uh it actually has ports here for me to connect two antennas for memo but it doesn't come like that out of the box and the transmitter in this is much weaker here the you know the antenna power is just not even close so uh if you took your sim card out of something like this and put it into here you are going to see an immediate difference in performance without a doubt i have seen this dozens of times myself by just simply transitioning it from one of those into the pep wave devices also the wi-fi range that it puts off in your rv so in other words it brings this signal in whether it's bringing in from public wi-fi or from your cellular plan and then of course uh this is creating its own hotspot within your rv and that that range that it's creating when you're within your rv is really uh really good so a lot of times if you use one of those little jet packs and you set that in the front of your rv and then you know you go back to your bedroom and you close the door it can really uh struggle with this unit right here it's just going to put off a much stronger signal within your rv so let's keep moving along here with what else you get so there is a gps port on the max transit duo so you got this little gps antenna in here you may or may not uh use this you certainly don't have to use it to get all of the other advantages from cellular and wi-fi out of this unit but you certainly can so there is a gps port here and you just screw the antenna right into it and this is the receiver here and basically a gps receiver is going to operate best if it has clear line of sight to the sky right so you could try to set this up maybe in your dash or something like in the window to try to get some good line of sight see how that works out but really the recommended way to do this is for this to go on the roof of your rv so you got some extra cable here now what is this doing it's basically just giving you your location at all times of wherever your your pep wave router is so why would you need that well maybe you wouldn't and maybe you just don't use this but just thinking of some reasons why you might use it it does log some of this information for a period of time so maybe you're thinking oh where was i at last week and you could go log into the back end and see the gps coordinates uh maybe another reason maybe if your rv got stolen right and then and then you could log into the back end and see exactly where it is that would be pretty handy but at the end of the day use it or don't use it the unit is going to work just fine without it you do get a power connection here with your kit i'm going to try and keep things neat here and move this over here so a wall outlet right that makes it easy and so plug it into the wall then you've got your connection point here and this is 12 to 48 volts dc is the operating range of this unit right here so with a wall outlet you just plug it in and you're good to go it also has a hardwired terminal block here and when you get your unit from techno rv not only do you get this with just comes with the pep wave we also throw in two additional power sources and then you can uh use whichever one is right for you so we are going to give you just a dc wiring fused wiring for you to use with the terminal block if that's what you would like to do and then we are also going to uh provide to you a cigarette lighter style plug right here and you plug that into your cigarette lighter and then the other end just go plugs directly into uh where this wall outlet plug plugged into on the back of the max transit duo right there so that would also be dc power as well that'll make it easy on you you'll have lots of power options for your max transit duo here so on the back of the unit here you do have a wan and a lan port and let me explain that briefly when wide area network is i can explain this maybe to where you you'll get it as it relates to like your own home right so let's say you've got your house and you've got like comcast cable and they provide the internet and then you would have a router for your wi-fi that you would plug the ethernet cable from the comcast connection you would plug that into the wan port right and then this would rebroadcast uh the bandwidth from that right well the same thing from here if you found yourself to where you did have access to a hard line from the internet you could plug it in here and it would rebroadcast it now maybe you're in an rv maybe you're in a boat you're likely not going to hardly ever find a scenario where you would actually be able to use that connection for that because you know most places don't have hardwired connections for us when we pull up right we're traveling there's also a lan port that's an out put scenario where you ethernet directly to say a laptop typically hard wiring to a device with your signal is going to give you a better experience than wirelessly connecting now me ninety percent or probably ninety-five percent of the time i'm wirelessly connecting to this but i don't know let's say you're working and you've got some zoom calls going on you just wanna make sure it's the best of the best you could plug your computer directly into the lan port here and that might improve your experience a little bit there now the wan port that again rvers and voters will likely never use you can reassign that to be an additional lan port it's just a a click in the back console that will reassign that and then you can have two lan ports and i suspect a lot of people will just we'll just do that so as it relates to your sim cards this does take full size sim cards and again it's dual modem so this means you can have multiple carriers and that it can use those carriers all at the same time and each one of the modems has two sim card slots so you can actually put four sim cards in here two for each modem i know that would be a lot but some people might want to do that they might want to just have four different plans and then they just kind of rotate between them it can certainly do that now as it relates to the sim cards we do have some adapters because if you're transitioning say a sim card that's not full size from like a jet pack or something like this into this then you would just get one of these adapters from us and you would pop that smaller sim card into the full-size adapter and then it would fit in there uh quite nicely so with the max transit duos when you get it from techno rv you are getting one year of uh prime care with this this is a uh pep wave product and basically what this does is it gives you your your one year warranty your one year worth of firmware upgrades as they become available and it gives you access to speed fusion and i'll talk about that a little bit and the the in control 2 console and basically the in control 2 console is a cl a pep wave cloud-based product to where you can go into this cloud-based product and manage this device from anywhere and it's got a lot of reporting and and neat little things in there that a lot of people really like the in control because of its ease of use now you can make changes to these units without the end control just by accessing this unit directly basically wirelessly connecting to it going to your ulrl bar and typing in a 192 number and it'll basically give you access to this now if all that language kind of freaks you out a little bit don't worry because we are going to have a techno rv learning series that we're going to send to you with this device that's going to show you how to do all of these things so we'll make sure you're successful no worries about that speed fusion let's talk about that so what speed fusion is is is it's a a series of products that you get with this uh for the first year it's it's something called hot failover uh wand smoothing and bonding let's talk about hot failover because this is pretty awesome let's say you have two cellular cards in here maybe you've got a verizon and an att and let's say you're working and you're on a zoom call and you must have unbreakable connectivity right the hot failover means that whichever uh data card you're pulling from if it were to fail this unit would fail over to the next one in line in an instant so quickly that it will not break your connection even on like a zoom call so i would say that's pretty spectacular also uh you can if you were also connected to like wi-fi connections in an area you were at you would you would have basically four times failover protection you would have your two cellular modem cards and you would have two different uh wi-fi connections so so what pepway is all about is this unbreakable connection for those of you out there that just absolutely have to have it when smoothing so what in the world is wand smoothing so what that is is this pep wave can take all of the available resources that you have to get internet which in this case you've got two cellular modems and let's say you have a verizon and an att or a t-mobile or whatever in here and then you've also got two wi-fi's let's say all that was connected you had these two wi-fi's connected to sources and and your uh cellular modems of course are fired up and ready to go what wand smoothing is is it will uh send whenever you get ready to use it say for a zoom call or whatever it sends packets out to all of these available resources and for the lack of a better uh way to put it whichever one of those resources does the best job at responding to the request then that's the one that's going to get the job right but it continuously does this throughout the process of say a movie you're watching or a phone call let's say so at the end of a 30-minute say zoom call like you could have used some data off of your verizon card some off your t-mobile some off your wi-fi because it's just constantly going out there and getting the best of the best and presenting it to you to make sure that you've always got the best connection that you can get for that so that is what uh that is what wand smoothing is called bonding is the other thing you get with speed fusion products and basically what bonding is is this unit takes all available resources again a couple of wi-fi a couple of cellular cards and with the two cellular modems and all together it goes out and gets these resources it fuses them together and presents back to you with the best possible scenario that you could have as it relates to bandwidth speed so it's doing all this in the background so maybe your verizon isn't that great in a particular area but your at t is uh your wi-fi is a little suspect but it doesn't matter with bonding because it's going to go out and get the best of the best of all of it fuse it together and present you back with a great experience so that is the three things that you get with with speed fusion and again this is just a simple when you get this unit it is a simple activation that you do on the back end and we're going to send you all the information on how to make that happen because once you activate speed fusion then you've got access to these different these different levels that will make your experience much better another thing that these pep wave products do is it's something called load balancing and what load balancing is is if you have multiple people accessing this unit which by the way these if i didn't mention it this can handle up to 150 users highly unlikely that uh rvers are going to be using it for that but that sort of consumption but it can handle it so what load balancing is is let's say uh you whoever you're rving with maybe you've got a couple of kids and everybody is connected to the pep wave it's highly unlikely that the consumption demands for bandwidth bandwidth are the same for all of the people that are logged on so what load balancing does is it evaluates what's going on with each person that's requesting the bandwidth for whatever they're doing and it properly appropriates uh the bandwidth that it has available to everyone that is on so that whatever their consumption demands are it'll make sure that uh that it meets that demand all this is going on in the background nothing you have to do to make that happen it is just doing it so that's load balancing all right let's talk about external antenna options so when you're on our site at techno rv uh we're going to give you recommended antennas that match perfectly with whatever unit you're looking at in this case the max transit duo so uh these inside antennas work great and you don't have to have an outside antenna to have a a great experience but the truth the matter is is that by having an outside antenna you are going to have better experiences over the long haul so we're rving boating all over the place right and sometimes you're closer to the cell tower than others and sometimes you've got more obstructions in the way than others so having that outside antenna is always going to have you sitting and ready for whatever the uh your environment may throw at you so the uh the pointing antenna that we have here is a omnidirectional seven in one antenna it is omnidirectional and this is designed to be mounted on your rv and seven in one means that you're going to have four cellular connections because you remember you've got two modems in here and each one of these modems takes two cellular antennas so it's got four cellular connections it's got two wi-fi connections which that's your 2.4 and your 5 gigahertz that we talked about and then it's also got your gps connection as well so this is the one that we uh recommend to be used for this unit right here now if you wanted to save a little bit of money and we'll talk about costs on all this here in just a little bit if you want to save a little bit of money on your antenna you could get a five in one puma antenna and that's going to give you your four cellular connections and your one gps so if you're like look i'm not going to use the wi-fi like that so let me save a little money on the antenna i really just want it for the the cellular you could get the puma now some people like directional antennas because the puma and the pointing are both omni-directional they're seeing 360 degrees some people like to have a uh directional antenna antenna in their arsenal and if that's the case let me reach over here and get this we do have this pointing directional antenna so typically what happens with the with the directional antenna obviously you need to point this in the direction of wherever the cell tower is but by it being directional it's it's reducing a lot of the interference of an antenna that might see 360 degrees and it's more just focused in that one area now the downside is is it's not doesn't see 360 degrees at each location you're going to need to uh do some fine tuning uh know where the cell towers are in your area but some people really like having this type of antenna in their uh in their arsenal and this is a two by one antenna so it's designed to just connect to to uh one of your cellular modems on the uh transit duo here so what i want to do now is just talk about pricing real quick now it's january of 2021 and uh things can change but as of right now the the max transit duo cat 6 modem is 799 dollars if you want the transit duo cat 12 modem uh it's 999 so that gets you the modem all the antennas that i show you all the power connections and it gets you that prime care for one year as well as it relates to antennas the pointing seven in one antenna is uh 297 bucks and the uh the five in five-in-one antenna here if you want to save a few bucks but not have the the wi-fi connectivity on your roof that's 199 bucks so as it relates to the directional antenna that's about 196 dollars so all this is going to be when you go into our page at technorv.com and you're looking at this product you'll see hey here's kind of the recommended antennas and you can pick and choose on drop down menus on what you want to get there we also have extension cables that you'll see available so the the length of cable that comes on all these you'll see those on our website if you don't think that length of cable is enough then we sell extension links for your outside antennas so that is everything that you need to know about the max transit duo cat6 and cat 12. you can get them at technorv.com and if you have any questions you can email you can chat with us you can call us and then of course once you buy from us we're going to make sure that you're you're well supported",

{"id": "5H-Wvym_Ls8", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "ozlx_A3s8TSA6UJMNzl1DnX-V5Y", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and in this video i want to talk to you about why you may want to consider a pep wave cellular embedded router for your mobile internet needs so with a cellular embedded router this means that you are going to supply the data plan the sim card with the data plan on it that's what will go into these routers and then the router is going to do the rest and by the rest that's what i'm going to be talking about in this video because they are quite amazing the things that these things can do to give you a better internet experience while you're out on the road as it relates to data plans we don't sell data plans we highly recommend that you go to the mobile internet resource center online that group has tremendous accurate information on the best data plans that are available out there right now and i use that all the time as a resource and i would recommend that you do the same now i have videos separate from this one because this is more just an overview but each individual pep wave device we have videos on them and they all have little variations that may one may appeal to you more than another and we will be certain to make sure that you are clear and understand each one of those devices while you make your purchasing decision if that's the route that you decide to go so let's get into the specifics of why you might want to consider a pep wave cellular router over say like a jet pack these type devices they're just cellular hot spots that you can get from your local cellular store we've used these for for a lot of years and it's really a night and day difference between a cellular router like a pep wave and using a hot spot and i really just want to talk about those difference so the first thing i want to talk about is is security because i know that's important to all of us that are information that we're transmitting across the internet is completely secure and pepwave 100 has this wrapped up so pep wave uses uh vpn technology basically the way this works is it it divides your transmission up into smaller pieces so there's really no single piece of information that is even usable to an attacker then the device codes these small pieces into to military grade 256 bit encryption so any data that ever leaves your pep wave device is going to be in these smaller pieces and encoded with this military-grade encryption so if you're worried about security maybe you work for a company and they require a certain level of encryption for you to even be on their server or something like that then the pep wave is going to have have you covered and then even if you're you know you're not working you're just retired you're you're worried about maybe going to your banking accounts and things like that doing this through a pep wave router is going to be the securest way that you could do that the next thing that i want to talk about is just the strength of one of these pep wave cellular routers and right out of the gate they're going to have stronger transmitters and stronger antennas than your standard uh hotspots here so in order to complete a transmission you need a transmitter to send information out you need an antenna to hear that information coming back and just by having stronger transmitters and antennas you're going to get better throughput speeds and it will be something that is is quite noticeable so that's the one thing the other thing is uh these are have built in memo antennas so memo meaning multiple in multiple out as opposed to a device that that just has a single antenna so let's think about this for a little bit so let's say you just have a single antenna that's trying to communicate uh with a tower so that single antenna is going to be trying to get its signal through maybe trees maybe you're in a valley maybe there's buildings around all sorts of things that it's struggling with whenever you start implementing more antennas it can reduce the errors that occur whenever you are whenever you have these type of problems of interference so by having multiple antennas it reduces those errors and by reducing those errors it will increase your your transmission speed so the next thing i want to talk about is something called carrier aggregation and uh this i want to try and simplify this because this is an ingredient of of this process with these routers that provides faster speeds for you so carrier aggregation is basically the ability for your device to combine multiple frequency bands together in order to give you a faster throughput so let's just take a quick example here you've got uh different category levels cat 4 cat 6 cat 12 cat 18. a cat 4 modem can only connect to one frequency band a cat 6 can connect to two frequency bands together combining them uh cat 12 is three and then there's cad 18 now that can combine up to five let's just imagine you're on a verizon network and this particular network that you're on there there are six frequency bands available and if you only have a cat 4 modem you're only going to be able to to connect to one if you have a cat 6 now you can pull two of those frequency bands the pep wave combines them together to give you more speeds so just imagine these uh frequency bands like they're just stores out there that you can go shopping in right wouldn't it be nice to be able to go shopping in the stores that are less crowded because a lot of times if you only ha or have access to one band a lot of times you will auto connect to what's considered like the most popular band but that's also the one that's the most crowded right so not necessarily a good thing so you could be on verizon having a poor experience switch bands all of a sudden have a great experience but you're still on verizon but you changed bands so by being able to to combine these multiple frequency bands it allows you to have access to more bands of course and to have better odds of not being on a band that is overloaded that's carrier aggregation we do not even sell a cat 4 modem because that's a single frequency band only and i just really don't see the point in that i consider that just older technology we start at cat 6 that starts at 2 2 times carrier aggregation uh the next thing let's move on is that these cellular routers do have what's called wi-fi as when basically what this means it will allow you to connect to uh public access points like the wi-fi at campground it also has stronger antennas and stronger transmitters like i mentioned to you which in essence makes it a wi-fi booster okay so a wi-fi booster is simply increasing your transmitter power and your antenna power over what say you could already get from like your cell phone through wi-fi so if you increase that power you're boosting it and therefore your wi-fi boosting this has the ability to do that to connect to campground wi-fi so that's just another option that you can have there another thing i want to point out just real quick before we get into more performance type issues is these things are built like a tank like industrial grade and they are certified to certain shock proof and vibration proof levels because a lot of industry uses these type devices and we're just getting the advantage of it right in the rv industry although i must say uh banging down the road in an rv can create uh quite a lot of of shock and vibration if you know what i mean there so these i'm just going to make that real short these things are built very well metal housing and they're just certified to handle the abuse another thing that these devices have the ability to do is uh it does have gps i don't suspect many people are going to use this because basically what it's doing is it's basically just tracking where this device is so you don't have to connect that uh when you get one of these devices if you don't want to use it but if you do it's available and so you can in the control panel it'll hold information for a certain period of time you can go back and look maybe if you had a question about where you were at or something then it could do that i suppose if somebody um stole your rv then having the gps turned on might be a good idea right so it does have that ability if that's something that you're interested in the next thing i want to talk about is something called load balancing that these devices have and this is going to be very useful if you have multiple users on one device so i don't know maybe it's you and one other person or maybe you got uh three four kids that are all connecting to the same device it's highly unlikely that the bandwidth needs for all these different people would be the same so load balancing takes care of this problem for you by evaluating what the demands are from the different people consuming the bandwidth and it appropriates it properly based on those consumption needs it uses eight different algorithms to accomplish this it's all going on in the background and what you will see is a user whether you're on a zoom call or gaming or just sending an email you will just see that you have the bandwidth appropriate to take care of that function the next thing i want to talk about with this is something called failover all of these device come with failover and what that means is if you have access to different methods of obtaining the internet so you're going to have a cellular card in here some of these devices have dual modems you can actually have two cellular plans in it and so what failover is is that if the particular method that you're accessing the internet say it's a verizon cellular card let's say that goes out for some reason then it has the ability to automatically fail over to one of the other methods that you have access whether that be internet or another cellular card now the the failover that you get just right out of the box is not necessarily instant right so maybe you're watching a movie and your cellular provider goes out uh and then and then your movie freezes right if you have a dual modem and i'm getting a little bit in the weeds here but if you have a dual modem with two actual cellular cards in them then if it were to freeze on one then you could just click refresh and it would automatically just kick in using the other one if you have a single cellular modem then that process may take a little bit more time like maybe a minute or so so your your screen freezes up uh it's going to automatically start working to move you to the next one but it may take a minute or so for it to do that so the last thing i want to talk about here is something called speed fusion and and this is basically a service with the pep wave products that you can activate when you get your device and again once you sort of go through and choose your particular device there will be more detailed information about all this as it relates to each device speed fusion is what i'll just call three services there is hot failover there's something called wand smoothing and there's something called bonding hot failover since we just talked about failover i'll just talk about that hot failover means that if you have that activated and you say you're on a dual modem pep wave uh or you have you're connected to campground wi-fi or whatever in other words you have multiple sources to the internet that you have access to within one device hot failover if your connection breaks it's instantly going to connect you to another source and there will be no break in whatever you're doing so for those of you that work out there you're on a zoom call like your boss is on the line and you're presenting to like 30 people or something like you can't be having internet problems right hot failover is spectacular for this because it happens in an instant so fast that it will not break the connection it's called it's called pep waves just unbreakable connection this hot failover the other thing that i want to talk about is something called when smoothing what when smoothing is and again this is having a pep wave device that that has access to say cellular maybe you're connected to wi-fi maybe you have two cellular cards in it what it what when smoothing is is that when you send a request out to the internet like maybe you're just going to start a movie or you're going to start a zoom call or whatever it'll send packets out to all of those different methods that you have built into it so again it could be if you have a dual modem it could be both of those sending packets out to say a verizon and an att and then maybe you're connected to campground wi-fi maybe somehow you you you're at a friend's house and you have a hardline ethernet connection in your wan port all these things are going on right so it sends packets out to all all of those and the easiest way that i can explain this is that whichever one performs the best at that moment that's the one getting the job okay but it doesn't stop there let's say you're on a 30-minute zoom call it continuously is doing this so throughout that call you could be using a little bit of data from your verizon a little bit of data from maybe an att that you have in your in your modem uh so it's not like hey it chooses one at the start of it and then it just stops there all this is going on in the background and it is spectacular especially for those that are working from the road and are looking for that sort of again that unbreakable high performance connection the other thing that you get with speed fusion that that third service is something called bonding and what bonding is is it's going to take all of your available resources to access the internet again that could be in a dual modem it could be multiple cellular cards maybe you're connected to uh campground wi-fi basically what bonding is doing is it is fusing together all of those different services into one pipeline coming back to you to increase your bandwidth speed right so bonding is an incredible uh piece of technology that that pep wave has and you will see a difference with that again you know everybody's different you know that like if that sounds appealing to you and you have something going on with how you need internet on the road if like that would be helpful but having access to multiple carriers wi-fi fusing them together to increase your bandwidth that is what bonding is and it is a spectacular addition to that that speed fusion i want to talk briefly about antennas all of these devices that we have have built-in antenna ports on them and and the units come with screw-on type antennas and so you could increase your gain with those antennas we also have external antennas and i'm not going to get into the details here other than to say that the inside antennas work great and outside antennas even better right when you go and look at our videos on our individual units that we have we have specific antennas that we are recommending for the particular device that you may be interested in the recommended outside antenna and if you want to pick that up then you'll just see the recommendation there on the on the product okay so that is the overview on why you may want to consider a pep wave cellular embedded router we've been using one for quite a while now it's made a big difference for us on the road we stock all this at techno rv we want to make sure you're educated on all of these products while you're making your decision so by all means chat email call us we're happy to help and again well once you buy from us you are going to get the techno rv learning series like you get

{"id": "dAU9ea-UnmQ", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "fYLfHrgy8Iuav6_NnqV5RLQ5JdA", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and in this video i'm going to tell you everything that you need to know about the tire minder i10 tire pressure monitoring kit and i thought i would start out by just telling you everything that comes in the kit and then we'll spend a little bit of time talking about the components that we need to spend a little bit more time on so what you get in the kit first of all is you get a color monitor this is going to be where you get the information uh about your tires the it's going to give you a pressure and temperature reading for each tire this monitor is just a bit over three inches so plenty of screen size for you to see that as you go down the road you want to take a quick glance at it it has a power supply that is a 12 volt power supply and then it comes with a usb to micro usb cable and the monitor does have a battery in it so it's not necessary to actually leave it plugged in while you're going down the road you can if you want to but if you don't want to and you want to just say hey that'll be one less cable hanging off of my dash you can certainly use it without it being plugged in so then what you're going to get is of course you need the sensors that are going to screw onto your valve stems and these sensors are what's going to broadcast forward to the monitor sitting with you the pressure and the temperature of each tire position so they're these little button uh cap sensors that have been a very uh proven piece of technology for for tire minder these when you get them there's no batteries in them but the kit does include batteries these are little 1632 batteries and so when you get your kit in of course you're going to need to put the batteries in them i do want to point out this is not an installation video this is more of an overview for someone who is looking at purchasing this kit and wants to know all about it so again the cap sensor in addition you're going to get some o-rings here in the kit and at the base of the cap on these sensors is a little o-ring to uh sort of keep the weather out it comes with those on here so these are extras and it does come with the kit so you'll be excited about that uh it also comes with a signal repeater and this is going to boost the signal strength from your sensor forward to the monitor we'll talk a little bit more about that here in just a bit and you're going to get some zip ties because when you mount your repeater you're going to need those zip ties to mount it in addition you do get a suction cup mount for your monitor so that just pops on the back and then you can just suction cup that onto a window so that you can see it going down the road uh in addition to that you get these little locking nuts here and this is a anti-theft feature for the cap sensors so you can easily just screw these right onto the valve stem and they'll work just fine and but the anti-theft measure is that of course if you just screw it on anybody can just walk by and just screw it right back off and take them for themselves with the locking nut if you choose to use that you'll screw this on then screw this on behind it and then there's a little tool that comes with the kit and you just back it up against the sensor and that will lock it on to the valve stem if some would be thieves come by they're not going to be able to take it you're also going to get the instruction manual so you'll want to read that and i did want to point out that when you buy the tire minder i-10 from techno rv you are going to get our techno rv learning series so i've already made videos on all of the installation processes and all the tips and tricks and everything that you need to know to be successful when you get this kit you're going to get it from us now you can always read the manual and use our learning series is a supplement to that but certainly a lot of people just like to have our learning series because they like the videos and you will get that whenever you order it from techno rv so you'll also have a warranty card that comes in your kit and you'll need to make sure that gets filled out and sent in there's a couple of different ways you can do that but it is always good to make sure that that happens so that's what comes in the kit and now what i thought i would do is back up a little bit and talk about maybe some unique functions of this kit so this system can handle up to 20 tires so should be more than enough even if you've got a class a with a tag axle and you're towing a jeep or whatever you tow you should have plenty of tire positions in the i-10 it's very easy from a programming standpoint to program the sensors into the monitor and again we're going to show you that in the techno rv learning series whenever you order the system you can also change fahrenheit to celsius psi to bar and in addition to that i did want to point out that on this screen you're gonna have all of your tire positions that you have programmed in on this screen and it's gonna show you it's monitoring your pressure and your temperature on the i-10 it's only going to show you one of those points of data at a time so you'll see all of your tire positions on one screen and then one point of data say it's psi well now let's say you want to see the temperature for those same set of tires you're just going to reach up hit a button on the top and then it'll transition that over so there is a bit of a manual process there in order to see all of the data in addition if you have say a truck that you're monitoring and a towable or say a motorhome and you're towing a vehicle the sensors on the back rv or tow vehicle will be on a separate screen so they don't all show on the same screen and then if you want to see that second set of sensors on the monitor then you just hit a button and it'll transition from the front sensors on say your motor home to the back sensors on the tow vehicle so there is a little bit of a manual process as it relates to uh this system but it still certainly gets the job done as far as when this goes into alarm so you'll get an audible alarm and then it's going to highlight the tire position that's in alarm and what point of data you're an alarm for so let's say you got a a tire leak on your back right tire audible alarm when you look at your monitor that back tire will be lit up and it will show the point of data that is an alarm again whether it's pressure or temperature this is a good time for me to talk about the importance of pressure and temperature so most blowouts are preceded by low pressure and high temperature so what happens you're driving down the road maybe you get a nail in your tire you don't know it you're driving you get this slow leak as the pressure goes down the temperature goes up when the temperature of a tire hits 200 degrees or a bit north of 200 the compounds in the tire start to break down and then this is whenever a blowout occurs so in most cases if you have a piece of technology like this it'll alarm you before the blowout happens it prevents a dangerous situation and prevents you ruining a nice day of rving as well because it'll alarm you before it happens give you time to maybe get up to the next exit get to a tire center and get things fixed before you have a blowout so that is the advantage of these systems and i consider it a a must-have for any rver no matter what size rv that you have so what kind of alarms are you going to get with this uh rapid pressure release so that's going to be three psi or more in less than two minutes it'll alarm you that a slow leak is six psi or more in two to ten minutes low pressure is just going to be a pressure loss of 15 of what your cold tire pressure should be so when you program the system you'll put in what your cold tire pressure should be let's say that's 100 psi if you were to get to 85 psi psi that's 85 or 15 less than your cold tire pressure you're going to get an alarm on the high pressure side it's going to be 20 percent above your cold tire pressure so if you're supposed to be at 100 and you get to 120 psi it's going to alarm you for that as well and then on the high temperature side which temperature high temperature is usually what kills the tire so it's going to alarm you if you get to 167 degrees so remember at 200 that's when most tires the compounds start breaking down so the idea here is that if you can be alarmed at right around 167 you probably got a problem that you need to check out whether you got brakes locking up or you got low psi and uh it'll give you time to get off the road and get that checked out i did want to talk a little bit more about the um the uh the repeater here and basically what the repeater is is it increases the signal strength it's a it's a radio signal that gets the the information from your sensor to the monitor so a lot of things can affect this it could be uh it could be a rainstorm it could be you're just driving through a city with high electronic interference this creates like a boosted zone around your rv and make sure that you always have good signal strength and that is a must for this system so no matter the size of your rv you want to make sure that you always use the repeater with this system whether you've got a small rv or a big rv in the learning series that you're going to get from us when you order the system i'm going to have complete video showing you how to install the repeater so no worries there so that is it that is the tire minder i-10 system and i got to tell you this is a great uh economical type system because the price point on this system is is really spectacular and so you should really

{"id": "UMDF1YI-cXs", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "4duYxGQIz_OHv9pG6fnL62C8rog", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and in this video i'm going to tell you everything that you need to know about the tire minder tire pressure monitoring system the app version of this kit and so what i thought we would do is start off by talking about everything that you get in the kit so let's start there and then we'll go back and talk about each component separately to make sure that you understand everything that you need to understand with this kit so in your kit you're going to get a bluetooth adapter you're also going to get a signal repeater and this is also going to come with a couple of zip ties to help you secure the uh signal repeater there you're going to have a power supply which is kind of cool because it's a tire minder power supply it comes with 12 volt and also comes with an ac power supply kind of all built into one so i really like that and then the connection is a usb to micro usb cable that you get here then of course the sensors that are going to be screwed onto your valve stem that's going to broadcast the information back to you for your tire pressure and the temperature of each tire however many of these sensors that you want that's just how many you order and that's how many you'll get so that is the tire minder sensor right there you're also going to get some battery packs because when you get your kit the sensor does not have the batteries installed in them but the batteries do come with your kit so you'll be excited about that also you're going to get some extra o-rings in the kit and basically at the base of each of these sensors is a o-ring and the o-rings are already installed on your sensors so the o-rings that you get they're just extras then you're going to get some of the locking nuts here that is the anti-theft measure for the sensor so if you want to use an anti-theft feature for this then it comes with it and but it's not necessary that you use it so you can screw the sensors right onto your valve stems and you can just unscrew them right off or you can use the locking nut and lock them onto the valve stem and that way if somebody came by and tried to take them they just wouldn't come off in addition you're going to get a operations manual and then you're going to get a warranty card that you'll need to fill out and get sent in and then they give you this neat little carrying case here so if you ever put your rv in storage and you needed somewhere to put all of your tire minder gear then you would have it right here so that's everything that comes into the kit now what i want to do is i want to spend a little bit of time talking about each component this is not an installation video when you order this kit from techno rv we're going to send you the techno rv learning series that's something you get that's unique to our company i've already made videos on how to do all the installs all the tips and tricks anything you need to know about that installation so that you can be successful with this kit i've already made a video about it we're going to email that to you whenever you order the kit from us so no worries there let's get into a little bit more detail about this kit i want to go back to this bluetooth adapter the signal so you're going to you're going to screw this sensor onto your valve stem and then this is going to be programmed into the app this broadcasts a radio signal the other component is your own smartphone right now you got to supply that that doesn't come with the kit but you'll download the app and so the sensors need to get the information from the sensor to your smartphone well your smartphone doesn't accept a radio signal directly from a sensor so you've got the bluetooth adapter the signal comes from the sensor to the bluetooth adapter and then this then sends the information to your smartphone okay so a crucial part of the kit here so what will happen is is let's say you had an alarm you had low pressure high temperature whatever the case may be this would actually alarm an audible alarm and a visual alarm whatever the condition is that's an alarm and the particular tire position that's in alarm that's going to show up on your app on your phone so again that's what this is for so uh this can just go in the front of your truck somewhere or if you're in a big rv just anywhere on your dash is fine as long as it's within uh close proximity to wherever your cell phone is so that's the bluetooth adapter a very important component of uh this kit i do want to go back to the signal repeater again the signal repeater is very important to this kit and it does need to be installed it doesn't matter the size of your rv whether it's big or small you need to install the signal repeater what this does remember the sensor is putting off a radio signal so a lot of things can interfere with radio signal let's say you drive through an area that's just got a high electronic interference maybe a populated city or maybe it's just raining outside and and that can create issues with signal as well by having this repeater connected just to any 12 volt power you just pop it straight to your batteries then this is going to make sure you always have good signal strength from your sensor forward to your smartphone so very crucial and again in the techno rv learning series i show you exactly how to install uh this system here the uh the app portion of this works with apple and android so if your apple just go to the apple store if you're android go to the google play store you'll download the app tire minder tpms it's a free download so no worries there there are a few key features that i would like to point out just about the app so on the screen of the app it's going to show basically uh all of your tires that you have programmed in and then it's going to show you the pressure and temperature of each tire position so it'll be one of those tire positions will be lit up and it'll say hey pressure and temperature and that'll be of that tire position it has an auto scrolling feature that you can enact on the app that basically means that it every five seconds it'll move to the next tire move to the next tire move to the next tire i love this because first of all the app is not intended for you to be staring at going down the road obviously that'd be a safety issue but at a quick glance i do like to peek over sometime like the same glance that i might give my speedometer right like that's totally legal to do that or my gps unit at a quick glance i might just look at my app just to see like what the data is if it's auto scrolling all the time each time that i might take a peek over it might be on a different tire so i can see my pressure is going up or my temperature is going up or if i have a leak going down and then of course uh if i have an alarm condition then uh it's going to let me know about that uh really quick and then i can make some decisions from there you can make adjustments uh from fahrenheit to celsius or psi to bar if you have say a truck loaded into your app with a towable and then let's say you get to the campsite you just take off in your truck but you still want to monitor the tires it's easy to just drop that rv off or the towable off of the app so that now it's not trying to ping those sensors that you just left so it's it's really easy to do that um let's talk about when you go into alarm real quick when you go into alarm like i said this is what's going to give you an audible alarm so when that happens if you've got a passenger then they should just take control of your app and they can easily see like which tire is in alarm and make some decisions if you've got a slow leak on a tire maybe you can make it to the next exit if it's a rapid pressure release maybe you need to figure out how to get off the road immediately so these are all decisions that you have to make from my standpoint my recommendation is just the safest move that you can make at that point then you need to make that so the alarms that you will get with this system are a rapid leak which is uh three psi or more in less than two minutes a slow leak is six psi or more in two to ten minutes a low pressure uh alarm just means that there is at least a 15 drop from what your cold tire pressure should be so if you're supposed to be at 100 and somehow you end up at 85 you're going to get alarmed and then also it does have a high pressure alert so if you get 20 above what your cold tire pressure is supposed to be so if you're supposed to be at 100 you get to 120 you're going to get an alarm on that and then the temperature so if you get to 167 degrees or greater it's going to alarm you of that as well here's why this is important most blowouts are preceded by low pressure high temperature so let's say you get a nail in your tire you're going down the road you don't know you got the nail in your tire you you start to get a slow leak as your pressure goes down your temperature goes up when a tire hits 200 degrees or north of 200 degrees then the compounds in the tire start to break down that's when you have a blowout if you can be alarmed of this prior to that happening in most cases you can avoid the blowout ruining your trip for the day creating a dangerous situation again these blowouts in a lot of cases can be prevented by having a system like that so the thing that makes this system special is that if you just want to have a system that works with your smartphone so that you're not say cluttering up your dash with more monitors then this is definitely the system that you need to get and uh and and the app version is what makes it special so we have them over at uh technorv.com you can get them over there and i do want to point out again that when you get this you are getting the technology learning series so we're going to make sure that you're successful with this system when you get it by getting those videos after the purchase and so that does it that's everything you need to know about the tire minder tire pressure monitoring system the app version", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2021-01-07T02:25:03Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "TireMinder SMART App Tire Pressure Monitoring

{"id": "kitoKGnmduA", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "ZBm79h_cCB0KNw-vqv3r_11VQO0", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and in this video i want to help you choose the right tire pressure monitoring system for your rv now techno rv sells three different tire pressure monitoring systems we sell the tire minder app kit we sell the tst tire pressure monitoring system the 507 and then we also sell the tire minder i10 kit now i did want to go ahead and point out that this is just a quick overview of all three but that we do have detailed videos about each one of these kits on our youtube channel so you can always go and get more information specifically about a particular system that you might uh be interested in as you may know i've been full-time rving in a motor home towing a jeep behind my motorhome since 2015. so i do have my own personal preference however my personal preference may not be your personal preference so i want to go through these and let you know my thoughts on them and then hopefully you'll have enough information to make a determination on which one of these systems is right for you so what i want to do is i want to start with the tire minder app system so this is a unique kit because it operates off of an app on your smartphone so it'll work with android or apple and with this kit you're gonna have a bluetooth adapter so while you don't have a dedicated monitor with this system uh you will have a bluetooth adapter that does need to go somewhere near where your cell phone is going to be or your smartphone where the actual tireminder app is going to be so for me if i were to use this system in my motorhome i would probably get a some sticky putty or a piece of velcro maybe just stick it on the front of my dash so while you are losing that monitor that maybe sits on your dash you you are gaining a bluetooth adapter that will sit there but it's nice and slim it stays out of the way nicely and shouldn't be a problem if you want an app version now of course you're gonna need your own smartphone and that does not come with the kit of course but again apple or android you will need for this the tire minder kit comes with these little cap sensors so a very small lightweight this is what's going to screw onto your valve stem and is going to broadcast forward to your app on your smartphone the pressure and temperature of each tire position so the app version can monitor up to 22 tires again it is doing pressure and temperature and it also comes with a signal repeater that you're going to make sure that you connect if you get this system because this is going to create a boosted zone around your rv to make sure you've got great signal strength from those sensors forward to uh your app on your your phone there so a lot going on with this system so one question you can ask yourself when you're making a decision on which one's right for you is do i want my system to be on a app on my phone if the answer to that is yes the decision's already made for you you're gonna get this tire minder kit right here because it would be the best system on the market that has a app so moving on to the tst system here now i will let you know that this is the system that i have chosen and tested i've had this system in 49 states in all different kinds of weather conditions it's it's never failed me and i really do like this system uh it does not come with an app so it does have a dedicated monitor that you get it's a color monitor and it displays your pressure and your temperature all on the same screen and so i really like that because at a quick glance i like having a dedicated monitor some people don't they want that app i like the dedicated monitor so at a quick glance while i'm driving down the road i can just peek at this dedicated monitor and get the information off of it another thing about the tst system is that you get multiple sensor choices and that is not something that you get with the the tire minder system so you do get the classic cap sensor from tst right so that's nice low profile so this is good for tow vehicles small travel trailers it'll go on rubber valve stems or metal valve stems so whatever you need that's the cap sensor version for the tst in addition tst offers what's called a flow through sensor now what this does is whenever you put this on your valve stem it's going to allow you to air up your tires through the sensor right without taking the sensor off the valve stem so again with the cap if that's on your valve stem you want to put air in your tire you need to unscrew this put air in then screw this back on with the flow through sensor you just leave it on there and air it up through the sensor so uh very unique there you do need to put these on metal valve stems they are not appropriate for rubber valve stems so keep that in mind in addition you can mix and match these for example i put these on my motor home and then i put the cap sensor on my jeep so you can mix and match them so that is a positive there in addition you can get what's called a hybrid sensor and this is basically a marine type sensor so i do have a boat with a boat trailer and i put these on my boat trailer because these can actually be submerged in water while all these sensors that you see up there are perfectly fine to be in any weather condition they're not designed to be submerged the marine sensor can actually be submerged so if you have an rv maybe later down the road you bought a little boat that had a trailer you could always just add these to the system in addition and i don't have one sitting out here but tst does offer a internal sensor that basically bands to the inside of of the uh the tire around the wheel so it's not it doesn't go on the valve stem it's basically banded so the tire would need to be broken down a tire professional would need to install that and then all that would broadcast forward to the monitor here the tst monitor can handle up to 38 tires on a single screen and then it can also monitor up to four trailers for a total of up to 112 sensors and you can customize parameters so for example on the tire minder systems you enter what your cold tire pressure should be and it automatically sets parameters in which you will be alarmed at 15 percent below and 20 percent above whatever that cold tire pressure is set at on the tst system it's a little more customizable you can actually go in and set your highs and lows and change your temperatures up on what you want to be alarmed on the temperature side of things so for me personally i like the idea that it's a little bit more customizable and then you do get a signal repeater with this as well with the tire pressure the tst you do get two mounting options you get a dash pad here and then you also get a suction cup mount that you can put on a window so the tst has just got a lot of options so uh as it stands right now if you want an app you're going with the the tire minder and the tst which is the system that i use is just like if you want just like all in everything that you can get in the system then you're going to go with the tst the tireminder i10 is what i would consider like an economical type system so basically what you're getting here is a system that is definitely going to monitor your pressure and temperature just like the rest of these systems and but there are some manual processes within the i-10 that are more automatic on the tst and even the tire minder app so on the tire minder i-10 you do get a color monitor and whenever you enter in the sensors onto the monitor it's going to show you a grouping of sensors say all the sensors on your motor home or your fifth wheel or whatever it is and then it's going to show you on one screen say your pressures but if you want to see the temperatures of those tires you do need to manually reach up and click a button let's say you've got a motor home and you're towing a whatever just any tow vehicle this system only shows uh one vehicle at a time so it would show your say your motor home on one screen if you want to see your tow vehicle you would have to manually press a button to move uh back to that so there are just a few manual things that you need to do with the i10 over say a more automatic uh system in the the tst and even the tire minder app now the i-10 comes with the same sensors as the app version does so you get these little button cap sensors that are really really lightweight and again these sensors have been around a long time and are a a proven very good sensor for for tire minder and then you do get the signal repeater uh as well with the the i10 system and then uh and then your your power supply so i'm gonna just summarize real quick because at the end of the day this is about tire safety uh most blowouts are preceded by low pressure and high temperature in any one of these systems will alarm you if you start to get low pressure when you get low pressure your temperature is going to go up on your tires if the tire gets to around 200 degrees or north of 200 degrees then the compounds in the tire will start to break down that's when you have a blowout so that's why no matter what you get these systems are going to alarm you in most cases before that blowout happens and eliminate that dangerous situation or certainly at minimum ruin your your day of rving so summarize if you want an app because i've talked to plenty of people at rv shows and they just walk up and they're like hey do you have something that's an app and if you try and show them anything else they're like i don't want to hear about it i want an app that's fine uh the tire minder is going to 100 satisfy uh the need for an app and it is a great system uh if you want what i use the one that's kind of got all the i would say all the bells and whistles it's more automatic you get more uh options with your sensors and then the the tst is going to be the system for you and then if you're looking for something economical this could be a lot of different situations why you might choose this maybe you bought a a travel trailer and you're just not wanting to spend a lot of money on a tire pressure monitoring system and you're like hey as long as it alarms me i'm fine then uh the tire minder i-10 is also a great system so that's it i hope that has answered all of your questions about these three systems and uh no matter which system you get i certainly want to encourage you as a full-time rv or most certainly monitor your tires with the tire pressure monitoring system you can get all this and all this information more information on this over at techno rv.com", "snippet": {"publishedAt":

to know about the vision works backup camera so if you follow techno rv at all you know i'm a full-time rver and i've been looking for a wireless backup camera for years to sell at techno rv and i never have been able to find one that works to the level that i feel comfortable selling one it usually had to do with signal strength from the monitor to the uh to the camera they were usually signal strength issues things would pixelate and i just didn't feel comfortable with that so i am very pleased to say that actually had a customer call me and came across this system that i had not seen yet and it comes from the agriculture industry and they've got this rv version of this camera and it is built like a tank and i was like bring it on send it to me so i've run this through all of its paces and all the testing and i'm happy to say that it works and i am pleased to bring it uh to you so let's talk about it uh this kit comes in with a either a five inch seven inch uh or nine inch high definition lcd wireless uh display monitor for the purpose of this video i'm showing you a kit with the seven inch screen but again there is a five inch and there is a nine inch screen as well uh your choice uh these monitors also have a built-in dvr in them which is very unique uh to a backup camera system so it's got an sd card slot that can take a 128 gig sd card which is not included by the way but it can record going down the road so that is pretty unique there the power supplies for your monitor is you're going to have a 12 volt power supply just for the ease of just plug it into your cigarette lighter and go and then it also has an ac power supply as well so anything uh as far as powering the monitor it's going to make it pretty easy as far as mounting options this kit comes with a suction cup mount and it's basically just got a little slide rail here on the back of it and then you can just suction cup that to your window it also comes with a cup holder mount and this system uh this would go in a cup holder and then you would just mount your monitor uh in the mount on the this right here so i do want to point out that the cup holder mount does not come with the nine inch uh monitor kit because uh the nine inch monitor is too big to fit into this but it does come with the five and the seven the nine inch monitor does come with the suction cup mount though also you get a remote control to operate the functions of your monitor so you can either operate this with the buttons on the front of it or with the remote control you get a uh your basically uh your wireless hd camera so this is the backup camera you're just going to mount this on the back of your rv or wherever you want it so you get that the power supply for this this is where things start to get interesting you do have a adapter here to hardwire this uh to power and then also you have the opportunity to use this kit with pre-wired rvs for the furion camera or voyager so some rvs have power pre-wired to the point where you would mount these and this system actually has brackets that work with that so when you order this system from techno rv you'll have a choice of either just a universal bracket to mount this onto the back of your rv or if you have a furion pre-wire and that might look familiar to you right so you would just mount this right into the spot of where your your pre-wire is for your furion if you have a voyager pre-wire then that is the voyager mount for the camera so no matter what your situation is you're gonna have a option here to mount your camera so in addition it does come with a shade for your monitor and in addition to the the cup holder mount and the suction cup mount i meant to mention it does come with like a hard mount that you mount here and that you could like permanently affix that to the front of your dash so i guess the point is is that you've got a lot of option at options as it relates to mounting all of the components of this kit so with that said i want to jump right in and talk a little bit more about the specific features of the different components so the wireless camera that's a sony camera so it is really built like a tank that's a metal casing it's got a ip68 rating on it and basically what that means is it's uh shock proof dust proof weatherproof and it has actually been tested to obtain an ip68 rating it had to be tested being submerged in water for 30 minutes at 1.5 meters so that is pretty strong there it comes with a three year warranty it is 1080p is the image quality on this so it is definitely putting off a high quality image as far as the distance that the wireless connection can cover it's a thousand feet of static line like just like line of sight a thousand feet but we know in the rv world that's not reality right so it's gonna have to to broadcast that signal through like your rv and if you have like a diesel pusher now you got the diesel engine uh in between you and the monitor that sits with you i tested this unit and i literally mounted this i've got a 41 foot motor home and i tow a jeep and i literally mounted this on the back of my jeep to get it as far away from the monitor that sits up with me in the motor home and i didn't even put it on the top of the jeep i like put it like in the middle of the back of the jeep to try to make the obstruction as much as i could and that was the test and i am happy to say that it passed with flying colors i really didn't think it was going to the manufacturer told me it would and it absolutely did so that's why i'm bringing this kit uh to you today is because uh it passed these tests that i know will uh be pleasing to you also night uh vision so get you know ask this sort of question when it comes to backup cameras when it comes to night time how you still need to be able to see so this has 18 infrared leds and in my testing if i have no street lights in front of me and and i'm looking out of my backup camera on my monitor i actually see out the back of my rv through the backup camera better than i can just visually with the naked eye on a dark street i mean it really lights it up so i'm super pleased with how it operates there it's got a 90 degree viewing angle so you're going to get a lot of coverage uh from the monitor here the monitor or the the camera comes prepared to the monitor so when you get this system and you give them power it's just going to start working so it's something that we really believe in at techno rv is that if we're going to sell something we want to make sure you're successful with it we want to make sure installation is easy while i'm talking about that i have made some videos of sort of installation the techno rv learning series and you'll get this when you order one of these from us but it's basically videos and information of of how to put this together and again to make sure you're successful with this as it relates to the monitor uh 1080p image quality and again you can watch and record up to four cameras so the kit comes with one camera you can just add them to it and do up to four cameras with this it does have a quad view on this so if you had uh four cameras then you could split the screen into four segments so that you could see all the screens or you can do a split screen and get a couple of them or you can just pick the camera that you want to have on the screen more on a full-time basis and again it does take 128 gig sd card and we're looking at the uh record rate is epoxy approximately one gig a byte one gigabyte per hour of recording and you'll be glad to know that when the sd card fills up that it basically rotates back around and starts recording over older information on that sd card so it'll always be recorded something happens and you want the information off of it you just pull the sd card and go ahead and get it off of there but in most cases nothing's happening and so you you know that it'll just keep on uh recording uh so again the uh the remote control is pretty nice i've already kind of mentioned this but you do have the the buttons on the front of the monitor to control the functions of the monitor or you can use the remote control i'm super pleased with this system uh again five seven and nine inch screen and uh that kind of covers all of the components that come with the kit and uh if i didn't mention it before with the the mounting brackets you get it because i showed you the universal the furion and the voyager you get a choice of those whichever one you want i mean if you've got a fury on pre-war get the fury on if you just want universe we'll get that so want to make sure that you knew that that was a choice and that you don't get all three of these uh mounting brackets so with that what i would like to do is there's a the the main competitors obviously are furion and voyager as it relates to backup cameras and what i thought i would do to kind of sort of close us out here is take a look at how this system compares to the competitors so let's take a look at that real quick so here we see a chart that compares vision works to voyager and furion and these are strictly facts that i'll just go through as stated by each of the manufacturers we'll start with the camera warranty the vision works as a three-year warranty where voyager and furion both have a one-year warranty the wireless range that i made such a big deal about uh in my testing is is rated at a thousand feet for the vision works the voyager is 60 to 100 and the furion is 500 feet the durability rating this ip rating is basically an industry standard that measures water resistance dust resistance and uh vibration tolerance and basically the higher the ip rating the more durable that your camera is so the vision works is an ip68 has a metal housing the voyager is an ipx6 which is uh that is lower than ip68 but they do have a metal housing so that's good and the furion is an ip65 with a plastic housing the uh recording ability so the vision works uh has it and the voyager and furion do not so you can actually record the video from the vision works which i think is pretty cool the night vision is uh if you're gonna do some night driving you're gonna want to make sure that uh you have a system that can handle that and the vision works has 18 ir leds the voyager has 14 ir leds and the virion has six so the more of those the better and with the vision works it really does excel at night uh the operating temperature uh they all do pretty well at this actually and uh but the vision works and voyager uh do a little bit better than than furion as you can see here and then as far as the uh the quad view is concerned uh the to be able to view multiple cameras on the same screen yes you can do it with the vision works you cannot do it with the voyager and uh with the theory on you can do that with the uh with the quad view and as you can see from a pricing standpoint uh the vision works systems are actually less expensive than the other ones even though they excel in every category so that's it we're super pleased to be carrying the vision works system for all of these reasons that we have talked about through my testing and just all of the specs and how it lines up with competitors and again specifically from our testing and just knowing that i've used the system it works so if you want to check out more information about the vision work systems from the five inch seven inch and nine inch systems and if you're ready to buy one you can just hop right over to technorv.com

{"id": "uR-0hN4v66U", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "_fZ182bJdFmyp62QJWws2cknU9E", "transcript": "hey this is eric and tammy over at techno rv welcome to the outside of our rv and welcome to 2021 yeah happy new year happy new year yeah so this is the video version of the january 2021 newsletter and uh yeah happy new year so i think most people are probably glad to get into the new year yeah i think there's this feeling and that everything is going to be better but so far it just feels the same we're going to make it better we're going to make it better okay that's a good plan we're going to make it better we'll just go with that so uh we have a lot to cover we do yeah absolutely as promised in the last newsletter uh but before that we are going to the tampa rv show we are in january a few days uh and don't really know what to expect there no idea they normally have a large crowd of people and i expect there's not going to be a large crowd of people so we're going to go yep and uh they apparently have all of the measures in place to uh make it a nice safe event for everybody so we're just going with that we are um but the big news in the newsletter was all of the new products three new products actually more than three three three yes brands new product brand yes and so is that the right way i see we just jump right in okay let's start small and then go big that is great that sounds good if you own a tst tire pressure monitoring system the wide monitor like the one from 2017 and on yeah uh you uh you love it i know you do uh because we love ours uh but one thing we get asked from time to time is can you uh increase and decrease the brightness on the screen uh and you cannot yeah depending on where you put it in your you know if you're in a motorhome or whatever sometimes sun can be directly on it yeah because the sun can wash out any screen i mean if it comes in at a certain angle and then you you struggle to see it so tst has come out with a sun shade uh that just pops so good on the top of of the unit there and then it blocks out from a lot of different angles that's coming in through your windshield so yeah so it works well we've used it it does work well we've used it and uh they're cheap they're like 15 bucks and it works if you have the suction cup mount on it or if you use your dash mount it works with both mounts yeah so it just pops right on just like you see there so if you have one of these this is an add-on it's 15 bucks so i just we we've got a bunch of them in in the warehouse because we suspected that everybody's got a tst you just want to go ahead and grab one of these so uh go to our site and get you one if you would like to provide some shade yes it is if you go to our site it's under tpms accessories or if you read our newsletter there's a direct link yes while we're talking about tpms let's roll right into our is this an announcement i feel like this is it is because we did not say what we were adding we just said we were exploring other tpms options yes so as everybody knows we only uh sell what we use what we've tested and what we believe to be the best system on the market and uh and we have always used the tst system for years we've had in 49 states it's never uh let us down and we are uh no worries we are still big fans of the tst and it is that we uh that we personally use on our rv however from time to time people ask us for uh a tpms that maybe works with your smartphone so the uh the tire minder is another brand that anytime that we would talk to somebody at shows or something like that if they would ask us hey what's the kind of the two top systems on the market we would always say well it's tst entire reminder uh the tire minder has a app system it's called the smart tpms and it basically uses your cell phone as the monitor right and we get asked that a lot because tst doesn't have an app so there are people that just wanted an app yeah we've been at rv shows before and somebody will come up and say do you have one that's got an app and i'm like no but let me show you and they don't want to hear it they're just like if you want an app for your tpms you just want to ask so we decided that you know what who are we to say what people want if somebody wants something something different uh because it's just like a different feature than than as long as it's a reliable system correct if it's a feature thing right and we've tested right so anyway uh there's more information in the newsletter about it we've got an article written about it and i've made a uh informational video all the features but it uh it is an awesome system and it works with it does your smartphone and uh so go check out our information on it to see if that's something that would appeal to you and if it does go for it the other thing we get asked is uh some people uh wish that there was maybe a more economical version of a tpms and not like cheaper not like cheaply made or like subpar or you know gonna not be reliable right just a less expensive not so many bells and whistles that does the same thing it might just do it differently yes so tire minder again has a system called the i-10 and uh it is less expensive than most units on the market but it still gets the job done it does uh so you might ask like why well there's a few features on it they're a little more manual than say on the tst uh where you have to hit some buttons to move some things around uh but it's still a great system it is connected easy to program it is easy to program and so uh we're going to offer that as well for those people that are looking for like just an economical uh system because you get people that have bought rvs from a million dollar rv down to somebody you know spent like ten thousand dollars on an rv and then there are people that only travel three or four times a year and you know buying a 500 or whatever however many tires they want a monitor system is really just not in their budget they're just they're wanting to just take a few trips but they do want to be safe and they want to be alarmed correct so here's how we're breaking this down uh we now offer three options if you want an app get the tire minder app uh if you want what we consider to be the best unit on the market as it relates to you got to dedicate and monitor all the bells and whistles and more features uh more sensor options and the one that we use and that we've tested in in 49 states then you get the tst right if you're looking for something economical then you've got this but so we just want to make sure we got everybody covered because at the end of the day it's about tire safety and i just want people to have a tire pressure monitoring system that works i know from full-time rving the importance of having one of these units so enough of that we have made learning series with the tire miner two new options so just what like with the tst if you get something from us we have done five to ten videos on each one about installing sensors and programming and setting baselines and all the stuff you're going to need to know about the tire minder when you buy from us okay sorry about all the starts and stops here in the editing but we're directly under the flight path of the airport here in the area uh so anyway this next product i may start crying like i'm so i'm so excited about this i have been looking for and many many customers over the years have been like why don't you sell a backup camera hate saying no on that but it's like oh we can't find one that we could we would cause constantly so basically we have been testing backup camera systems for really years i mean somebody would come out with one we would try it and the main test that we would do is to make sure that a wireless camera system has the range so that you can get clarity on the monitor without it pixelating and dropping out and all this kind of business and so a customer of techno rv sent me an email and said eric i found this system and i really think you ought to check it out i got it it's i remember you telling me incredible and so i called the company i said send me some stuff and they did and we've been testing this for months now let me tell you something it is absolutely incredible it's a wireless system the name of the company is vision works uh and they have been in the agriculture industry uh making farm equipment things since like 1983 for about 15 years they've been making camera systems for the agriculture industry and they rolled into the rv industry maybe like a year ago so this is one of those scenarios where we in the rv industry get the advantage of something that is built like a tank for the agriculture industry and now we get it right in the rv industry so here's what we get we have three systems a five inch system a seven inch system and a whopping nine inch system right i'm using this one in my jeep right now yes so uh you know you know people always say look you look at the situation that you've got uh if you can handle a bigger screen get it i suspect the seven inch will be super popular people with big class a's they may want this one people with smaller trucks may want this one i think the seven would be good the jeep front window is really small and the five fits well but in your truck if we were towing something behind us i think the seven would would actually be fine yes so it's all high definition the camera this is actually a sony camera and it's it's got a durability it's durability rating it starts with the the letters ip and so they do it a lot with cell phones and things but they they run it through durability testing this is an ip68 durability which is a higher durability rating than any other backup camera system on the market it is a metal case a lot of other people use plastic cases and the range on this static range is a thousand feet and i've actually driven all the way out to the road here with no obstructions now we know that's not the real world in the rv industry but we have we connected the jeep to the back of the rv and then i put this camera on the back of the jeep like the back of the tire on the back of the jeep to try to give it as much obstructions as i possibly could and then i put the monitor like on the floorboard of the rv to even give it more obstructions and it worked great it was it blew my mind i didn't think it would i didn't either i was totally expecting failure exactly sad to say but i was like yeah yeah everybody says 100 feet now 1000 feet yeah okay yeah they they say that and then they do and then it never happens for us it never happens uh here comes another plane so we know it's it's durable and this ip68 rating is is the testing for that part of it of course it's dust and and uh you know being able to be outside but it's also tested like uh being submerged in like 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes i mean it's not designed to be submerged obviously but the fact that that's part of the standard right is pretty incredible it is it speaks to its durability for sure the other good news about this is that they have designed the brackets to work with furion pre-wires and voyager pre-wires so when you order one you can order a universal mount if you're just starting from scratch and you've got no pre-wire there's a universal mount you can get the furion mount so if you've got an rv that's already got the little dummy little plate up there this is the bracket that works with for that and if you have one that has a voyager pre-wire there's the foil the holes match and everything it'll just line right up and it'll make it a really clean install um on your pre-wired fury on or whatever the other thing and by the way because i don't want to just keep talking about this we've we've made videos we've written that you go go look at the article in the newsletter first of all uh but this is um uh this also can record and you can put an sd card in and actually record from it so it can actually be used as a security system as well because you can put up to four cameras on this so maybe you get to your site and you buy an extra camera with this and it has two ac adapters that come with it so you could potentially move the monitor maybe your bedroom and then power another camera uh like outside of your site or something shining towards right because it can hold up to four cameras yeah four screens it's a quad screen yeah and it records them all so um there's a lot of features on this that just make it great it's built like a tank we're so excited about it so excited about it and i feel like i just need to end it there and just say go look at all of the other information yeah i have some pictures i've i've posted pictures of the vision at dusk the vision at night i don't know the night rating but i posted a picture because it was just blew my mind how dark it was outside how great i could see behind me couldn't see anything in front of me but i could see great behind me and even at dusk where it was really really just poor lighting outside i saw so well when i was using it um in the jeep and three year warranty oh yeah where i mean i hate to talk about the competition but furion and voyager only have a one year warranty just got a three year warranty because they built it so well um anyway check it out on our site if you if you have questions let us know you have to know which mount you want when you you can't just buy the kit you have to select which amount so make that decision yeah absolutely uh okay real quick um we're we're going to have another product launch towards the end of this month maybe into february how much we can get done after tampa yes another one we're excited about we're going to be selling the pep wave cellular routers that line of products and we have been using it and testing it and as it relates to staying connected on the road and cellular signal this has made a world of difference for us uh we we there was one scenario where we went from a negative 120 db uh signal strength which is an unusable signal from a cellular standpoint we put our sim card into one of these cellular routers we have a pretty beefy one yeah and just plugged it in and we went to like negative 67 or 60 which is where we're sitting around here and we've never been like that here using our hots like just our jet packs just we're not neck you're nighthawk we've not been at that no so the reason we've delayed it a little bit is because there's a lot for us to learn and we want to make sure that when we roll it out that we're able to explain it in great detail we don't want to overwhelm so we want to make sure that the ones we offer you know we just really want to get this right so yeah so we've delayed it a little bit but if you were looking for the method to stay connected on the road as it relates to a cellular standpoint i believe that this is going to be a great option for a lot of people yeah it's not a cell plan you have to have the cell plan for the router but the router is a great way to stay connected um there's a link in the newsletter to learn more on another article from another site the mobile internet resource center so if that interests you and you just want to start studying up on it um you can go check that out and then we'll release more information in the next couple weeks yes um okay so that's it uh that's not it oh we're giving something away yes we've started this thing where we give something away uh so um it's for

{"id": "y3q_cCKaL5s", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "jJgnNMHcEDeb6H_oopMWWC_gkVA", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and i'm excited to bring to you today the weboost drive reach rv unit and uh what you get here this is a cellular booster and we're excited about it because this unit right here can reach 74 farther than the previous model so that's a big deal in addition it is 5g ready you're going to be good for the next decade with this unit right here it also has a a game-changing 29.5 dbm output power rating and it has a max overall gain of 50 db and this is the most allowed by the fcc for a cellular booster that's designed to be used in motion so with that increased power on your up link you're going to get better upload speeds and then again with just your overall max power output you're going to be good on basically the upload speeds and the download speeds that's a big deal for this unit it works with all carriers and it can support multiple devices all at the same time so what i want to do is just get into what comes with this kit here so that you know what you're getting when you order one and basically besides the shiny box here that you get and all this nice packaging you're going to get a a installation guide so there's basically two guides in here and one of them is like a sort of a a quick install guide and for those of you that might need a little more detailed information there's a complete installation guide the good news is is that whenever you purchase this from technorv.com we're also going to send you the techno rv learning series which is instructions that we've put together and to make sure that you're successful with this unit so we've basically pulled together all of the resources that we boost has and the knowledge that we have about this unit and the installation of it put it all in a nice package for you and send it to you so that's very important so let's start getting into this with a cellular booster you're going to have a outside antenna that's what's going to bring in the weak signal from the local cell tower so they have made some changes to this otr style antenna here and they have basically beefed it up it meets military and nema ip66 standards and basically what that means is as it relates to the beating that this could potentially take outside in the weather whether it be wind rain hail dust dirt pretty much whatever you can throw at it it's designed for that so they have beefed this up that is your outside antenna and it is going to be able to uh take the abuse of outdoors so in addition to this you're going to get a a 13 inch mast and basically this is going to you'll run this cable through the mast and this is basically going to give it its extension here right you will also get what's called a side exit adapter here and this is basically going to whenever this cable comes out of the bottom of this mast then the cable will then be able to exit out of the side of this so they thought that out really well and you get a little bit of this um it's like thread lock so that whenever you put these pieces together you know they're going to stay together okay so that's all good news also this spring mount that is going to go at the base of of the antenna here right and this is good because if you were to maybe hit a tree limb or something like that that it will give a little bit and uh it's not something that you know i would recommend you go really testing but they do give you a bit of spring here just in case so this antenna comes with 25 feet of rg58 cable and so your antenna will be outside you will run this cable inside into your rv with this 25 feet of cable and it's going to connect to the basically the engine of this whole uh product here is the reach amplifier this is where you're getting that 50 db of gain through this amplifier here and your and your uplink power so uh this is where all the magic happens so it's a great unit it's super powerful it is a proven unit and it will be the standard for many years to come the antenna the outside antenna cable will come in and connect to one end of this amplifier that'll just be inside of your rv so we've got your outside antenna we've got your amplifier out of the other side of the amplifier clean up my space here a little bit is going to be the inside antenna and you get 13 feet of rg 58 cable with this this inside antenna is what is going to rebroadcast the boosted cell signal within your rv so if you think about it just sort of all together here you've got your outside antenna this brings in the weak cell signal from the local cell tower it runs that weak signal through the amplifier where it gets boosted and then out of the other side of that amplifier is connected your inside antenna where it re-broadcasts that boosted signal it uh it is sort of like bringing a piece of the cell tower inside of your rv so this is where uh anything within a certain distance from this unit or as long as it's in that boosted zone that it creates within your rv will get boosted whether it be a cell phone a tablet or whatever you might have that that needs uh cellular uh to be boosted so okay so there is that it does come with this uh wall outlet power supply and so that makes it really easy just plug it into a regular ac wall outlet and that will fire up the the amplifier here in addition you're going to get a few mounting uh brackets you're going to get uh you're going to get this l bracket here and a couple of u-bolts so that you can connect it's going to allow you to uh connect this to like a pole or something like that and so we will put some some details about different ways that you can do this different ways that you can mount it because that's usually the question that we get is like hey what are the different ways that people are doing this and so in addition you've got some uh some some some velcro strips here you've got these little press tabs and some uh some zip ties and basically these are just to help you tidy up your installation so you if you're permanently installing this you know you're going to have part of that 25 foot rg 58 potentially running across the top of your rb rv to get to the entry point and these will help sort of clean that up and make it a nice uh install there for you so there are a few different options as far as installing that you can see in the techno rv learning series guide that will send you when you purchase these units but you can permanently install these units or this works great with the techno rv antenna suction cup mount and basically this allows you to erect this unit when you arrive at a location and set it up temporarily it is what i do as a as a full-time rv or on the road if i get somewhere that has poor cell signal and i need this unit then i can have it put up temporarily in less than five minutes with that techno rv suction cup mount you can find those at technorv.com as well so there you have it that is the the drive reach rv from weboost and you can get all the information you need about it and you can purchase it right from us at technorv.com", "snippet": {"publishedAt":

{"id": "k9rlE1ijQRM", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "U9OLXM-1FAyEcdrOiKby9X3wLT8", "transcript": "hey techno rvers this is eric and tammy from techno rv this video is hopefully the first of many to come so as you may know we put out a newsletter with educational articles once a month a little updates of what we've been doing as rvers as well yep more information like that and what we decided is that we would also do a video version of that to where because a lot of times people people go to like rv rallies and things like that and we'll get up and talk about a lot of these topics and we're like well we could just do that when these newsletters come out plus a lot of people don't want to read the newsletter let's be honest i mean there's people who rather watch video yes and eric is one of those people i would airplane airplanes she's right i would rather watch a video than uh than read right but the other thing that we're gonna do that's really exciting and uh is that we're actually going to do a giveaway on this video about garmin 780 gps rv gps and i think we should do that every time we do one of these newsletter videos but i like that idea well if you like it and i like it then yeah there's nobody else really to vote so at the end of this video we are going to draw from our newsletter list uh for the garmin 780. so i say we just get started because we've got a lot to talk about it is it's got a it's a it's a jam-packed newsletter yeah so let's start off on kind of sort of what we did uh in in september and then we can roll into uh some of our uh articles in the in the newsletter good idea so some of you may not know we actually our home office where we are right now is in mobile alabama yes so the weather here you know in september has kind of dominated the month in a way well we've been dodging hurricanes in fact right now it's kind of windy right now because hurricane delta is west of us and we're getting some of these outer bands of winds and so in september we had had planned this grand trip had it planned for a while because we are rarely in this area in the summertime because we're traveling full-time but due to the pandemic we kind of stay put this year here and one of our favorite things to do in the summer is to go scalloping in port st joe so the minute we realize we're going to be here all summer let's book somewhere and catch scalloping this season yes and because our son was going to meet us there we decided hey we'll leave the rv behind we'll rent a house so we have more room and uh and we'll go down there and go scalloping so port at port st joe is in florida and uh it's this really small town and the big thing that happens around there is scallop season it's around august september time frame there's a bay that they just that's where they go scallops go and you basically snorkel in about three feet of water yeah if that's okay yeah and then you just pick them up off the bottom and they're kind of funny little creatures yes in the newsletter i included a little video of the little scallop swimming i might can put it in this as well kind of yeah uh so anyway we go there with this grand plan of having a nice sunny week well hurricane sally comes along and our son even traveled from atlanta to meet us he traveled from the safety of his home in atlanta to a hurricane area in port st joe that's the love that's for us and so the this hurricane was huge and the the outer bands of it started hitting port st joe long like probably two three days before the eye of the hurricane actually hit land way west and this hurricane they were not sure where it was going to hit so it was kind of this we watched a lot of the weather channel at that time sometimes they know where it's going to go this one was like what's it going to do oh my goodness and so we really weren't sure what was going to happen yeah so what what did happen is it rained the entire week when we were supposed to be scalloping every day every day every day last day what did not so basically uh which what you know i mean it was bad but for us it was like hey we get to spend a lot of time with our son inside and i'm not sure what he was thinking he was probably thinking what you just brought me down to but uh he's a trooper so uh we got to play video games he and i played a lot of guitar together it really was a fun day it ended up being fun we worked some during the day we had a larger space than what we're used to in the rv which was a nice little break and we had we actually had some rving friends that met us too yeah that mattis said they were at an rv park and they would come over to the house good enough friends they too willingly came into a hurricane zone to hang out not that we would recommend them no uh so anyway uh the last day the the sun broke through and we did we did get to go out in the boat and go scallop and we got about three gallons of scallops so that was good which really is only about three ounces of meat but still yeah fun but a few hundred miles away at the techno rv office was our rv and the eye of the hurricane was coming up into mobile bay which is not far from our office so i was very concerned about our rv uh i i contemplated coming back and moving it and and then we just did the time just got away from us so ideally again like tammy said we wouldn't even be in hurricane area anyway but it's just been kind of a strange year 70 75 mile an hour winds at the office now over in the beach area a little bit east of it it was much worse than that luckily the wind was was blowing uh north to south and it was blowing right into the windshield of the rv which was sort of ideal right bottom line is made it out without a scratch everybody in the techno rv office is fine no issues at the at fort st joe other than bad rain yeah yeah and uh you know i mean i guess they're we were lucky not a lot of people weren't so lucky but we were very lucky during him yeah yeah so everybody's fine so we're happy about that uh something else that we did uh recently is we just did another virtual rally we did yeah it was uh the forest river owners group had we had partnered with them to do a virtual rally there was over 10 000 people registered for this event and we were the hosts of it and and we did a lot of this we did a lot of uh yeah we did nightly and giving stuff away nightly videos and that sort of thing but uh anyway i just wanted to point that out because in the newsletter uh there is a little question there in the newsletter that says hey what do you think about just a techno rv rally we've been doing it with like owners groups which we love but then we were like well we've got a a big newsletter list and we could just we could do one for them yeah the frog one was fun we are forest river owners with our new rockwood mini light 2511. yup so that one we we were part of that group even though you know they were an owner's group that that asked us to do that but it would be cool to just do it for people that are techno our viewers we could see it's up to y'all really so there's the there's something in the newsletter click it and say hey would you like to see that basically it had seminars and it had product specials and giveaways and contests and stuff you'd see at regular rallies yeah a lot of interaction it's a great place to meet new rvers and things so anyway let us know if you're interested in that all right so enough about that let's get into the technical articles yeah of the newsletter video articles three of them we got three of them okay so and you can find links to all these articles at technorv.com in the articles section if after this you do want to go and read them that's a quick way to find them if you don't want to go find the newsletter in your email uh so number one we just took on a new product yeah called soft start rv and uh and this is its actual launch even though it's been on the website for a few days and it has been super popular just in those few days this is the official launch so what is a soft start rv i can explain it in just a few sentences i think can you when you start an ac unit up the amperage spikes to above 50 amps but it's only for just a split second like a sixth of a second and then it comes back down and settles in after the compressor gets started uh 12 to 14 amps is its uh running current that spike can cause certain problems for rvers mainly if you're in say a 30 amp rv with one ac unit and you want to try and run your ac on a small generator yeah which is popular it's very popular but it can overload that generator uh if you're in a 50 amp rv like this one but you're on a 30 amp pedestal normally you would only be able to run uh one air conditioner but with if you have soft starts and installed on a couple of your ac units you could actually run two air conditioner units on a 30 amp pep store and you might be asking why would you ever plug a 50 amp into a 30 amp a lot of the older campgrounds don't have 50 amp yet state parks there's a lot of situations where we're only on 30 amp and we can only have one ac which you know in a very hot place when you have not ideal it is not ideal not ideal because basically especially with pets yeah i mean this is designed to stay cool in a hot environment with three air conditioners so if you can only run one you can sort of see how that's going to be a problem and uh and mama techno over here she doesn't do good when it's too hot inside the rv so you install these uh it's easy too there's there's there's only five wires you install them uh to you to your uh compressor on your rv which sounds so technical but i watched i actually recorded the installation video we did and it simply connecting five wires to five wires it's really not it would i could easily have done it yeah well you videoed me doing it right it was not difficult at all yeah and the hardest part was getting on and off the roof yeah hey be careful that i did [Laughter] heights are not my favorite thing and so uh yeah it's quite the scene me getting me getting on and off off the roof i'm very like a magnet i'm like stuck stuck to things you know so uh but anyway the installation is easy and they're uh we sell them at techno rv and we send out a learning series with all these links from soft start on how to install this on the different types of rvs that are out of there and soft start has uh something where you can set up an appointment to where they will walk you through the install on the phone in real time like while you're on the roof so it's of course it's a quality product but the customer service sort of put us over the top and you know you don't get customer service like that when products aren't quality because they would hate to be on the phone with you with their less than awesome product while you're installing it so it actually says a lot about their product when they they're willing to sit right there with you yes in my opinion yeah i agree i agree they are not afraid of that and so uh basically we've taken this product line on i've already installed it on our rv it works great and uh and i also did a a interview with mike sokol who is the rv electricity guy that he's pretty much the expert in or you're going to get an electrical opinion on an rv it's a product it's him for sure and so i did an interview with him that y'all can check out and he talks about sort of how these work what they're actually doing but the the idea here is that they level eyes out that spike so when normally it would be take a sixth of a second and that would spike up to say 53 54 amps with when the soft starts involved it may take a third of a second but it levelizes that out to where maybe it's only just above 20 amps to start the r these air conditioner before it drops down to that 12 to 14 amps it's a great product it is and before we started researching it i thought that we couldn't run two air conditioners because while they're running they had they pulled too much and they had too high of am set it was just learning about this that it's really just the sixth of a second it's that it's that amount of time that it can't you know so that's the problem it's not while they're running they exceed your ability to run it it's that little kick at the beginning yeah yeah they call it inrush that that spike at the at the beginning and so uh anyway check them out at techno rv and that does bring us into the point of what you just mentioned of more of why did we choose them a we research it's not like we just look at one brand we go look at what's the problem what are all the solutions available yeah compare them and then so if if there's if for example there's multiple say quality units on the market then we start digging deeper okay and and and looking into hey it's a quality unit what other things set this company apart certainly the customer service the quality of the product the customer service uh of it and uh the reviews we read all the reviews you even called into their customer service department as a customer just to test them just to make sure that what they offered is what you expected yeah i might have made up a name but but these are the things we do because we want to make sure that when you uh start interacting with with companies that we deal with and offer to you that you have a great experience and so uh so softstart's a great company go check it out yeah technorv.com if you've got any questions just let us know i'll put the link in the video description below okay all right so off air conditioners let's move to tires yeah so the next we have two articles about tires in the october newsletter i really like these uh one of them is a bit a bit technical and it's called ambient uh and how does ambient temperature affect tires yes and i did preface this by saying look this is this is technical i don't want people like stressing out too much over you know a pound of pressure there's a formula in the article okay if that tells you anything but in order to put the proper pressure into a tire the the way to do it is you have to get your rv weighed at each tire position is the best and we have another article about that we do and then you take that that weight and you apply it to the inflation chart that each manufacturer has for their rv and then you just follow along say hey i've got 5 000 pounds on this tire or across this axle or whatever what should the pressure be of the tires and then it'll just tell you so the question that i get sometimes at seminars is well because ambient temperature can raise and lower the pressure of your tire what temperature is the inflation chart uh making the assumption at and that assumption is it's 70 degrees so if you're uh you know setting your tires pressure and you have your weight and you do that and it's like 80 degrees well you're 10 degrees above what the assumption is so the formula here is that for every 10 degrees up or down from 70 that is the equivalent of 2 psi 2 ps up or down depending on what production you're going so uh well that may it's probably not a big deal for most people because typically our veers are not in extreme weather you know whatever seems like a perfect day yeah we try to just stay right at 70. that would be ideal yes we try to find that perfect weather but if you find yourself in extreme weather for long periods of time uh then this this would be actually important so if you think about it 10 degrees uh equals 2 psi so if my pressure was supposed to be 100 degrees it's or a 100 psi at 70. at 70. if i am in zero degree weather and if you run the math on all this then it should be at 86. that's 70 degrees below yes which means that seven of the tens in that formula so seven times two psi is four that's right so that's how you get to the number so again most people are not going to be in these extreme temperatures now what what more than likely people would find is that well maybe i'm in 80 degree weather more or 90 degree weather more well you know if you're going to be in and out of 70 degree and 80 degree it's not really enough to worry about because you i don't want i don't want people stressing out about two psi okay so this though is not what we talk about when we tell customers that say you run for 20-25 minutes the psi goes up this is not a relationship to that no good point when we talk about cold tire pressure this means preferably a tire that has sat overnight and had time to cool off okay that is your that is your cold tire pressure when you start running down the road and and the temperature rises because the friction on the tire then your pressure is going to go up because of that right but that's different everything we're talking about is everything relating to cold cold higher pressure without running preferably in the morning when it's had time to sit overnight yes so so good point yeah i'm glad you brought that up another thing that we get asked questions about is just elevation and this is has has much lesser of an effect on your psi than you might think it doesn't feel like that though because you definitely can have a bag of chips yeah at sea level and go up uh the mountain and it pop and so there is that thought process that oh my gosh if potato chips can pop what are my tires gonna do yes so sea level to about five thousand feet is about two psi so you know it's again another nothing to alarm you with the tire another thing to um to point out is that that under pressure is worse on a tire than overpressure so again you don't want to get tangled up in in too much of the technical aspects of that it's good to know but in all cases you should always err on the side of of more pressure being over inflated as opposed to under like if you just don't know always air on the side of my yeah always air on the side of more so uh anyway that is the effect that ambient temperature has on on your tires all right let's move on to the uh next topic and y'all are gonna love us for this one right because it is how to improve your gas mileage and uh rv's gas mileage yeah yeah keep more money in your pocket right now no sense in uh just throwing it out the window if you don't have to right more toys yeah so all right there are uh four identifiable ways that you can improve yep your gas mileage and uh number one is that the more weight you carry this is the one i don't like the more weight that you carry that is going to have a negative effect on your your fuel economy so when you think about all the stuff you're packing for a trip or even the things that you buy along the way uh it can the the just think about it i mean your engine is going to have to work harder to move more weight so this is a conversation that we have all it is because i know when we first started packing the rv from moving out of our house because in a house i had a place setting for eight you know i'm thinking bring my place setting for eight and nobody i i have never had setting for eight and if i did it was definitely paper plates um so there are some things like clothes you bring so many clothes but reality is we probably wore this about four or five days ago because we just rotate the same things over and over again because you like certain outfits so we usually over pack clothes over pack kitchen gadgets um yeah buy too many things on our trips and don't take things out and then you have to consider the toys that you want to bring so is it is it better to bring that kayak or bring whatever or is it better just to maybe rent them when you get somewhere yeah we got to where we stopped carrying our kayak it was very heavy and we rent it now because we realized we were using it every once in a while and not only the weight but just the time and the effort of bringing it and all that was not worth it uh and then finally our tanks you don't realize how much water how much stuff is weighing you down in the rv just with our amount of fluids and water and tanks yeah so we always empty uh uh black and gray before we travel and then our fresh water tank assuming we're not going somewhere where we're not gonna have water if we go if we're doing that then we will carry more fresh water but typically we carry about a quarter of our capacity in fresh water just in case you know what i mean it's like you may pull over the rest area or maybe you get hung up somewhere and you weren't able to make it to your destination if we know we're going to be off grid more i mean sometimes i might carry more but yeah but in general we'll carry about a how much is a gallon of water is eight pounds yeah it's like i think eight a little over eight i think pounds uh so you it starts to add up really quick especially if you have your large tanks so do an inventory and uh we actually do an in well not a complete inventory but we do take a look at things that we carry with us from time to time and be like okay we haven't touched that in a long time it's got to go yep so wait is the first one what's our second tip okay the second one is something that we've kind of already talked about and it's and it's probably the biggest one and this is tire pressure so okay here's how this works a a ra a tire that is at its optimal pressure uh will have the correct amount of drag as it relates to that tire on the ground think about it if you're under pressure your tire footprint will start to grow you know what a flat tire looks like it's the bottom of it really starts smooshing out well that's more surface area on the ground and that increases the drag on the tire and therefore your engine in your rv or your truck or whatever is having to work harder to move the rv down the road yep so 100 if you can keep the correct tire pressure you will without a doubt improve your fuel economy right yeah this is this is uh rvers um should be 100 on board with this i know like the trucking industry it is like at the top of their priorities because it's a business and every penny they can save yeah i mean which which should be the same fleet of trucks i mean you think about the so anyway for rvers oh speaking of that uh we do have a tire pressure monitoring system sitting out here it's the tst brand it's the brand we've used for five years keeping proper tire pressure is pretty simple actually you know once you know what it's supposed to be you can get a tire pressure monitoring system we do have them at technorv.com and basically it does all the work for you it does all the work for you so you have a sensor there's a couple of different sensor types this is called a cap sensor you screw this onto your valve stem and once it's pressurized it reports forward to a monitor that sits with you and your rv the pressure and temperature of that tire so you don't have to go around and check it every time or every morning or whatever your normal routine is you don't have to do that anymore it will give you that while you're still sitting still before you take off your trip and alarm you of anything and then while you're driving down the road if say you pick up a nail or there may be a defect or something in your tire that's causing issues there could be a multitude of reasons it will alarm you of that as well if you have low pressure high pressure high temp yeah and the truth of the matter is is most rvers not this group not that not not technical architecture not this group but but most rvers do not check their tire pressures like they should and we see it all the time at rallies we'll just walk around and we'll help people and we'll be checking pressures and doing things and it is very common for people to be under shocking yes yep it's shocking okay slow down that's the next one you're really good about this though yeah i mean you're not a paw paw driver but you are a very good solid driver where you do not speed number three that's why i married you slow down because i'm slow you're safe okay so the faster you go all right the higher the rpms you're running you're going to burn you're going to burn more gas i mean the there is there is a difference in fuel economy between somebody driving 55 to 60 and somebody driving 70 and 75. a lot of the cars will show you that now the new cars with the panels you can i mean you know it you know if you you know if you speed up and you floor it sometimes i don't want to see it i know i definitely don't want to be looking at that the whole time i'll be doing like 30. but the other thing is that tires speaking of tires i don't even know if this is in the article but some tires are rated and shouldn't even be going over 55 or 60 or 65 yeah yeah every tire uh has a maximum speed yeah has a speed limit rating on it so yeah you should check that out just look up your manufacturer and see what it is but as it relates to fuel economy yes slow down what are you in a hurry for right yeah we're rving that's right so uh so slow down and you'll save some there right the other one is uh in general just servicing your engine and uh and your chassis and making sure that your alignment is correct i mean if you think about it if your alignment's off uh and and you're not you're not dead straight with your tires and there's any variance to that i mean you can just imagine it i mean that's going to place a drag on things and make the engine work harder and then you can just have things with you and hurt your tires i remember we had a a fuel filter problem at one point uh it took me maybe i don't know a couple of weeks to kind of figure out like what is going on here uh but it whenever we changed it it was quite the scene there was like gunk in it so yeah it was gross it was not good so little things like that can really hurt your fuel economy so we always take our rv in once a year we take it in and get a full service of the of the chassis and and the engine uh a lot of people do it themselves especially if it's a if that's your thing if that's your thing do it so that uh that wraps it up that's the four things if you want to improve your fuel economy just kind of go through those and see if you can make some little improvements there and and that'll help you out yeah and uh hey it's time to give something away you excited yeah so this is good stuff so what we've decided is uh we'll put these videos out uh on the newsletter and then we'll give something away and we'll just see how that goes and we'll just keep it up sometimes it might be something big sometimes it might be something small but it can always be something i can always come up with this time it's something big sometimes yes it is awesome this time so it is the garmin 780 rv uh gps and um and basically you can enter your height your weight propane tanks and it will route you according to your rv so you know like in this big thing behind me you know it's 13 feet tall i can't it's i'm not made for every road with my weight my height and all that so i know it's going to route me on roads that are safe for my rv and i love that about it it's a seven inch screen the other thing i like about it is in addition to just the safety of knowing we're not going to be taking somewhere we shouldn't be it gives you all of the rv campgrounds and all the types of locations that are relevant to rvers whether it be truck stops or rest areas or national parks and campgrounds and stuff like that so it's all in here so i'm not having to transfer or use you know look it up on google and then put it in another gps or transferred or anything it's just so simple to keep all the places we've been and find all the locations we want to go all in here without using your cell signal because it's satellite and database so uh we're going to draw a name and tammy has so here's the thing the the the people that are in the drawing are the people that subscribe to our newsletter list yes and uh so tammy has put them into a random generator is it already pulled up it is i'm just waiting to push the button uh so uh there's a couple of things that i want to say before we do this if you are not subscribed to our newsletter you should go subscribe to it just go to technorv.com i need your email in order to enter you yeah exactly so go to technorv.com and it's on the home page if you scroll down right and that way and i may put a link in the description too yeah we'll put it in the description so you can go subscribe there because

{"id": "0AHSfZigiuM", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "VFqHLk1matIAbneMmxnl_Yi-XQI", "transcript": "hey this is eric over at techno rv and in this video i'm going to show you how to install the soft start rv on this air conditioner right here that is a coleman mock and so it's simple there's the this unit actually just has five wires on it so that's kind of how you know how you need to think of it might look a little intimidating at the end of the day it's five wires so soft start rv has a lot of information as it relates to install that you should have got with your kit so you can always check that out and go watch their videos as well if you have a different type of ac unit then the install may be a little bit different as it relates to which wires go where so keep that in mind this video may does not apply to all ac units certainly step number one is turn the ac unit off i like to cut the power completely to my rv before i get started on a project like this and uh and so let's go ahead and get started and get this soft start rv installed on this unit so the first thing that you need to do is or it's a good idea to just go ahead and print the instructions i took a picture of them on my phone so you'll see me referring to this and so step one of this process is that i need to take the blue yellow and black wires from the soft start and i need to run it into the area where the run capacitor is which is going to be right through this area here now what i did is i went ahead before i started the project and went ahead and put on the end terminals here so i think that's a good idea before you even get on top of the rv to go ahead and install these so obviously we got to take the cover off of the ac so whatever you got to do to make that happen i've already done it and then i've already taken the side panel off to where the run capacitor is and so now it is time to run the black yellow and blue wire from the soft start into the run capacitor area so whatever you got to do to make that happen go ahead and get started with that while i do it here all right so i'm looking at my instructions again here and it says that i need to remove the white wire from the run capacitor [Music] sounds easy enough here's the run capacitor here is the white wire and so i'm just removing that and then step two says that i now need to connect uh the white wire [Music] to the blue wire from the soft start that i just ran through now this one already has a terminal that i had installed uh as you can see so it's already got it in here that should fit this white terminal on here uh quite easily so i'll just slide that on there so the white was removed from the run capacitor and the white was connected to the blue wire from the soft start and the next step is to take the black wire and uh and put it to where we just pulled the white wire off of the run capacitor so that makes sense the black wire from the soft start is right here and i'm gonna put it where i pulled the white wire from which was right here in front of this yellow wire and i'm just going to slide that onto the run capacitor okay we're doing good the next step is i need to take the yellow wire from the soft start and connect it to the terminal by the red wire in the run capacitor so here is my yellow wire from the soft start and it says that i need to connect it next to the red wire on the run capacitor so here's my red wire so i just need to connect it to one of these other terminals just like that easy stuff we're doing good here [Music] all right so there's three wires down look we only have two more wires to go this brown and red wire here and so uh let's figure out where where these go so if i look at my instructions again uh it says that i need to locate the blue or or black compressor wire and uh trace it uh back uh into where this area is so this is my compressor here and apparently this wire can either be blue or black as far as i can tell it's black so it's this one right here and what i need to do is i need to follow this wire in to here and you really need to get this right let's see okay let's see is that it right here nope this it here yes that's it right there okay this is the black wire from there we go this is the black wire from the uh compressor and so what i am going to do is i am going to cut this wire so where things start getting serious to where i have access to uh the both ends here uh so that i can connect the additional two wires from the run start and what i'm going to do and let me double check here i'm going to connect the brown wire of the soft start is going to be connected so let's say i just cut it right here the brown wire from the soft start is going to go on the end that goes back to the compressor and the red wire from the soft start is going to go to the other end so i'm going to have to splice some wire here to do that and uh also wanted to point out that soft start comes with all of your uh little bits and pieces that you're gonna need to make this happen uh all of these little uh end pieces that i've already put on to the other three wires came in this kit and then i'm also going to be using uh these two white pieces here to connect my final two wires all right let's get going here it's time to cut the wire so uh let's cut it about right here there we go again i encourage you to double check which wire you're cutting before you do it this has got to be the one going back to the compressor and i know that that is the case and so now it is time to splice uh this wire right here it's always good to have a good set of splicers and this is the south wire brand of a splicer that i have here and it can make a job much easier if i can see also a good set of eyes makes this type of job a bit easier there we go put that in there go around just like that and i need to do that this end too so it'll be a little easier because i got a little more room to work with there we go okay okay the brown wire from soft start which is right here these are untangled we'll clean all this up once we're done here is going to go to the compressor side of the black wire so basically i'm just going to put those two together right there and use the included connector here i will say that it is always good to have a good set of crimpers uh two you can get away with something maybe less than this but this is designed for crimping uh these these type of ends right here and so i know that i'm going to get a good solid crimp all right so i'm going to run this brown wire back through the back side here and that way it will clean things up so if uh if the hole that you had to work with here it's a little tight and you might have to work with it a little bit it's all part of the process and the fun though okay now we're getting there folks now i am going to use my trusty crimper actually my father-in-law's trusty crimper to bring these two pieces together just mix them together here like this and up in here give it a good twist to make sure they're up in there right [Music] and now this is where a good crimper comes in handy you're gonna love this part and you're not gonna love it if you don't have a good crimper but i do and therefore i know that that's only or not going anywhere all right one more wiring we're done again i think the key to this whole thing here is to read over the instructions and watch the video uh from soft start just a few times get an idea of what they're talking about maybe even come up here and and take a few pictures of your run capacitor and your compressor so that you can look at the pictures while you're watching the install videos get a real clear picture of kind of what's going on because at the end of the day even though it might look a little intimidating again we're just talking about five wires here it's not hard at all the other thing that i want to point out is that if you feel uncomfortable with this type of operation then you could pay somebody to do it or soft start has a support level that you could actually set up an appointment with them and someone will actually get on the phone with you while you're on the roof of your rv and walk you through the entire install so i think that that level of support is uh is perfect and one of the reasons that we choose soft start is because of their sport i'm going to run this final wire through the uh back hole here and i have enough room but i'm gonna tell you what it's barely getting excited about using this though okay made it through and i'm gonna twist these together all right once again let's get these twisted together the included cap here the proper crimp that makes this so much easier [Music] and [Music] all right so that completes the install as it relates to the wiring now we need to clean this up a little bit here uh and so you can take the time to do that uh it comes with well three zip ties if you need more you can get those at the local hardware market we are going to need to uh basically install the unit on the side of the housing here it comes with this 3m tape and it comes with screws if you want to screw it in there i'll probably use the 3m tape see how that works i'm sure it will work good i believe that i'm going to put my soft start right here on the housing uh it needs to either be up and down or sideways but never upside down uh or else you might get moisture in this area here so i think i'm gonna install mine like just up and down and right in this area but before we do that we need to test it because all the wiring's done and i am looking for some particular lights here on the soft start and i need to refer back to my manual here on my phone and it says that uh let's see okay i'm looking for uh to confirm that a green light uh is on one is that what i'm looking for that must be this here yep okay well i'm gonna read over this and make sure but bottom line is it's time to test it and uh so that means i need to give power back to the rv and i need to start the ac unit and then uh and then it is just gonna work i know it is because i know we installed it correctly and then we'll just clean this up and we'll be done so that's the complete install on the soft start rv and as you can see once uh the covers go back on the install looks quite nice there so we're looking forward to a lot of good years of use out of this again you get the soft start rv from technorv.com and this install i would say took no more than say about 30 minutes", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-10-11T15:47:10Z", "channelId":

{"id": "zdT8qiG5wpw", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "boBuD0bh1Ea5NwEew24CDJ1N4KQ", "transcript": "hey so this is eric over at techno rv super excited today to learn about a product that we've just launched on technorv.com it's called soft start rv and it's got all to do with your air conditioner units and uh one of the things that uh we do to make sure that we're getting great quality products is we like to vent these through industry experts and so one of the people that i talk to quite frequently about things regarding electricity technology is mike sokol i consider him an industry expert i've learned a lot from him you've probably heard of him from his facebook group uh he does a lot of articles and so bringing mike sokol in here how you doing sir very very good thank you so much for having me and welcome everyone yeah absolutely so listen we we just uh took on a product as you know called soft start rv and uh as i was going through this process uh i had called you and asked you all these sorts of questions so if it's okay with you i'd kind of like to rewind the clock and sort of ask you all these questions again uh so that the audience can hear the answers that sound good go for it all right so uh regarding air conditioners uh i've heard a lot of talk about something called uh inrush or starting current uh as it relates to the air conditioner unit and i'm just going to leave it at that and let you talk about that for a little bit okay so this is one of these things i've been doing installing industrial electric motors and troubleshooting them for 50 years and this is the thing that you see when when an air conditioner starts up or even your vacuum cleaner or almost anything you'll see like your lights dim in your house for a second or so um and this is what we call this inrush current it's basically the extra current that that motor needs to get the compressor started at up to speed and even though i had read about this in textbooks for years and years and years i had to do a little studying on this and i found that things did not seem to have all of the proper information that i wanted to to learn about this so i went and built my own gadget to go test this i built something called hurdle okay you can kind of see that's for high rate data logger and you can see on the screen here um this is a gadget that i cobble together out of my parts um in my background it's basically like a high-speed digital storage oscilloscope but i can record at 192 000 bits per second and i can record for hours and hours if i want and then i can put it into a nice graph that everybody could see mike mike i'm not surprised that you came up with something like this by the way it's great it it it is so much fun because basically this uses a lot of audio gears many people know i'm a pro audio engineer and so if you look here you can see my little cursor on the top this is the inrush current okay that you get now these little wiggly lines that's actually the 60 hertz cycle you've heard about 60 cycle ac 60 hertz ac yes that's what we're seeing i'm basically measuring the hum of this system and so this red bar up here is showing us how much current so you can see in the beginning here you got like four amperes or so on the fan motors running and then what happens is when that compressor kicks it when it's calling for to make it colder it jumps up in this case it's jumping up to about 52 amperes or so and it does it for a very very short period of time about a sixth of a second and then it goes back down it rebounds around you know the people tell me that that's likely uh bubbles collapsing within the freon stream which i think is really cool and it goes back down to the normal running current um that we get on this is a um a dometic uh 15 000 btu air conditioner pretty pretty typical you know just regular rooftop air conditioner so you this in rush many times is three to four times the normal running current and where you get into trouble with that kind of thing is the fact that well generators don't like inrush current a whole lot you can get away with it on your home you can get away with it if you're plugged into a pedestal that's fully powered um but you may not get away with it um if you're you know you're in any kind of limited power situations yeah so let me ask you a question um about the about the hurts i i've been as you know a full-time rv and i do keep a close eye on uh the power power consumption all these sorts of things i've never i've never once seen uh my hurts fluctuate from 60. in in these situations where you have this spike is that affected at all or is that a non-issue no okay so 60 hertz um is basically the entire united states electrical grid except for texas i think because they're on their own little they they do their own little thing um exactly 60 hertz this is all crystal controlled every generator in the united states is running exactly in synchronization there is no way that you as an individual can draw that down and change that frequency um and in fact you can't let's say you had a big generator like i said like a great big dynamo generator we would do for rock when they cut drum would go we could actually watch the hertz dip because the engine would go that kind of thing you'll never see a change however if you had this hooked to a dynamo style generator like a like a onan gener common zone and generator in your rv you could see that thing deviate 59 hertz 61 hertz most gear doesn't really care about that unless um as you know i'm a musician unless you're playing a ham and b3 and then it goes out of tune right you don't like that a whole lot but vast majority of times one plus or minus one hertz never that's really basically cycles per second it's right around b-flat well i don't believe you ever play attitude mike so you know unacceptable right that's not that's not acceptable and not acceptable at all so uh so this end rush uh if i saw your your graph there it seems like in the example that you gave right there it seems like there was uh this in rush of about 52 53 amps uh is that common across most ac units that you might find on an rv or is it a little bit higher a little bit lower it could be it could be a little bit higher i was on a a fairly long line that had a little bit of droop to it when it calls up and i did that on purpose to kind of simulate what you would have at a campground if i was on very close to the power supply coming in you know that the service panel it might be 60 or 70 ampere's peak got it okay wow just depends because it's dragging down a little bit i'm going to do some more experiments with that in my lab but this is fairly fairly common this 50-ish kind of amperes of current uh it's it's it happens in the blink of an eye but you know it's enough to make light stem yeah so uh you know i'm in a 50 amp rv i've got three ac units and then we do also have a a smaller 30 amp rv that's that's got one ac um but i've certainly had moments where i've been on a 30 amp pedestal in my 50 amp rv and uh needed to be mindful of that uh that i could only run one ac unit and i presume that it's this in rush that is keeping me from running two ac units would that be a fair statement it is and remember it's in a lot of people don't understand the difference between a 50 amp service and a 30 amp service is a lot more than you think a 50 amp surface is actually a 100 amperes of current at 120 volts so now you're going from 100 amperes which you can do pretty much whatever you want down to 30 amperes which now you have to do what we call manual load shedding that is you got to be careful it's most of the time you get into trouble attempting to run two air conditioners on a 30 amp feed from a campground yes absolutely so i want to bring in the idea of the uh the soft start uh system and i've got one here um just so that people can kind of see what it looks like they're they're not they're not very big uh but the soft start is a device that will uh sort of level out minimize that inrush can you talk about that and maybe give us some details on like what is what exactly is going on that's making that happen within this device yeah it's kind of neat because i i this is what i built my hurdle device for because the what was happening my my the best meters that i had would actually sample this five times a second this whole event takes place in under you know a tenth of a second okay so what i did was you can see the top half up here of this graph is with the stock what we call the starting capacitor and then the bottom half of it is exactly the same unit 10 minutes later after i swapped in a soft start rv uh and so what's happening is instead of this big smack like dropping the clutch on a car and squealing the tires this is kind of like a hydrostatic transmission that baby goes wamp and you can see on my graph that it's building this up so it takes twice as long to start it now when i say twice as long it takes one third of a second rather than one-sixth of a second but it does reduce the peak so in my case what i measured you can see over here i'm starting with four amperes of the normal fan running and then what it does is i limit this to less than half so it's about 24 amps peak current then it bops back down to the normal 13 amperes so a soft start rv unit does not decrease your normal running amperage what it does is it cuts the peak current in half this inrush current in half which is what allows you and usually it's that inrush current which trips circuit breakers or makes generators behave badly got it so if if we can reduce that in rush uh like you're showing here yes uh what are some things that an rver may be able to do that they otherwise wouldn't be able to do without the soft star device well what i've been doing is experimenting um you can actually run a 15 000 btu air conditioner i'm running it off a little honda eu 2200 generator so basically a little 2 000 watt class generator can in fact run it now it doesn't run a lot of other stuff at the same time but it it actually works really beautifully it starts at every single time whereas if i don't have it i may only be able to start it successfully 30 percent of the time and the other two-thirds of the time it trips the generator off um okay so that's what allows me to start that up quite easily because of that um if i've got a 30 amp uh rv with one ac unit i would be able to uh run my ac unit off the 2000 watt generator yes the the other thing that this does and i think this is really really important um if you're in a any kind of a um a situation where you've had you know a hurricane tornado power outage and let's say you're out mooch docking and this is a new term i just heard stocking just means you go hang out in your brother-in-law's or friend's house and you just plug into like a 15 or 20 amp outlet on the side of the house we're gonna get you all up to date on all the rv terms mike who knew who knew um so yeah so let me just kick back to my face shot so yeah so this allows you to actually go plug into a regular conventional you know 15 or 20 amp outlet on the side of the house and be able to run your air conditioner which i think if you're a first responder i you know i've had and i had dozens and dozens of emails saying my wife you know we we've got the our camper in the backyard we just want to plug it into a wall outlet she doesn't want to come in because she's she's helping in a covered ward or i've got first responders that are down right now down to lake charles um trying to put the electrical grid back together after the hurricane damage here a couple weeks ago yes and they're saying we we have limited power you know what can what can you do and i said you need soft start rv because again that helps reduce that all of those uh that stress on the system well you know what i we talked to rvers all over the country and everybody has got unique situations uh and but but i'm not surprised that almost everybody at some point or another when they're rv and is gonna run into a situation like this where where that spike in that ac unit is gonna cause a problem i've got a a friend of mine and i wanted to run this by you he's got a big fifth wheel he's got it's a 50 amp it's three ac units uh i don't know the the rating on the ac units he's got a generator and i don't know the size of his generator but what he says is is he cannot run all three units on the generator unless he staggers starts them right and then even then it's sort of a hit and miss so would that help him it absolutely will and now remember you will need a soft start rv for each rooftop air conditioner so if you've got three of them two of them you need that many of these soft start units to do that but if if if it'll run them all normally you've got to stagger them the fact that it will reduce that starting current to less than half of what it would normally mean would would in fact help with all of all of that sort of thing the other thing that's crazy with this um and i finally got this this uh this dometic air conditioner off of my bench and stuck it outside and ran cabling out and everything you can't hear it when the compressor starts up with this it's just it's like a jerush instead of you know normally you have a bang that you and you can actually hear it shudder and bang it doesn't shutter and bang with this unit which means you can sleep through it which who knew who knew so so some other uh positive side effects and and uh so yeah i was going to ask about that that's interesting because i hear that sometimes too with that again it's like uh sort of hitting a brick wall you just hear it starting up is there any i i don't know if i'm i'm pushing my luck on the uh the side benefits of this but would i be using less electricity would this would it be noticeable or is that is that pushing it too much here with this well you know so so let's go back now i i am going to avoid the calculus here because that's actually what it would take to show this because but you could do it though right mike well you know my kids are better at calculus than i am you know i haven't done it since college i haven't really needed to do it but if if you look at over here you see we have a large amount of current high amount of current for a shorter amount of time and and with the soft start you have a lower amount of current for a long time if we were to look at the area since like square inches or whatever under these two things you know here versus here they're going to be very very similar yes and so that does not really reduce the amount of wattage or power that you need because it is it is actually doing half as much current for twice as long yes that's the easiest way to think about that stuff so if i wanted to and i don't want to i could apply the calculus we could show that but just trust me um you know it doesn't really help anything except it's it just assists the generators or any limited power situation you know be it mooch docking or a pair of air conditioners on a 30 amp it just assists it in getting the thing started without less of a grunt that makes sense so uh i did a install of the soft start unit here on my 30 amp rv and i intend to put two of these on my uh 50 50 amp rv and so uh in fact i'll probably put it on all three of them just so i don't have to pick and choose which ones i use in a on a hot day so uh the installation i i found to be very easy after i sort of studied the the instructions uh there was a video that saw uh provides and i just can't i just kept in my mind look it's five wires how hard this can this be right do you have any uh suggestions or any feedback on your installation that you might have for somebody that's planning on doing the install themselves well a couple of things to to do is you guys all have a high resolution camera on your phones i cannot tell you the number of people that have disconnected stuff and then they call me up and say how does the hook back up but i'm going how am i supposed to know so you take pictures of this you document your pictures right um the other thing that i did and let me see if i've got this i do uh i use waygo lever connectors for this this juego stuff is terrific okay yeah um and basically this guy you just pop this little lever loose and then you slide the wires directly inside and then just snap it back down and these are rated for all kinds i mean this is so far superior to regular um twist nuts now i've had people say well these things will pop loose well you know if you feel silly about that you know put a wrap of tape around the darn thing but this allows you to take it in and out this is how i've been able to successfully install and deinstall um my soft start unit half a dozen times as i'm doing my experiments this stuff is so much better i actually have an article about which we can send you a link i call it legomywego actually i think it's pronounced waggo but i'm sorry i've changed the pronunciation of these guys to fit my cutesy little article so zuzuego waggo connectors these lever action guys are great for that um the other thing i will tell you and a lot of people don't understand this um when you're up on a rooftop of a of an rv that might be 10 11 12 feet tall it's dangerous if you fall so you have to take all your safety precautions about you know ladders and safety and good shoes i teach a lot of safety things and i got to tell you most electricians who die while working on roofs don't die from electric shock they die because they fall off the roof and they fall off the ladder sure you still have to have good safety precautions and you want to make sure that you are disconnected from all power make sure your inverter is off your generator's off you're unplugged for everything i hate to sound like i'm paranoid but i'm paranoid working around live electricity so make sure all of that stuff is down yeah i remember a uh it's a osha standard called lockout tag out and it's it's the idea that you would take the uh your plug and actually lock it out to make sure that nobody else could plug it back in uh if somebody was working on a piece of equipment so for rvers a lot of times they can just completely roll up their uh their units back into their rv i would suggest not just leaving it on the ground right next to the pedestal where somebody could come by and plug it in yeah we yeah we call it lotto in fact i'm getting ready to do an sop a standard operating procedure for campgrounds about this for for technicians and maintenance guys working on things so lockout tag out you know at the very least you know i wrap a piece of tape around things and just put you know do not use in the industrial world we actually have a like a hasp that goes on there and we have a key we have actually a little lock that goes on it and that lock has my name on it and i've got my key i'm the only guy with that key uh to that lock and then you know we might have four or five electricians working on things we all put our locks on this thing yes and until everybody when the job when everybody comes off of this thing all the locks are removed but it is a a serious fine and osha fine and you would be fired if you went ahead and say i'm just disconnect i'm cutting his lock off if it if if his lock is on there he's out there in the field someplace you go find him and you drag him back there and maybe he's hurt maybe there's a problem and a lot of people don't understand that but you're right you do not want to just leave this thing plugged in and turn off the breaker in the pedestal because some good samaritan is going to come by oh his his air conditioner's not running let me turn the power on for him hold on let me help him out right let me help him out people generally don't do these things out of any kind of um vindictiveness they just do it because they don't understand yes like i said i'm paranoid i've been doing this very seriously for 50 years and casually for 60 some years um so yeah be careful yeah so i've got one more question i've heard this idea of a uh i believe they call them hard start capacitor so your ac unit has a capacitor and and uh but but but it's my understanding this is this is some kind of stored energy type capacitor that can help a unit in certain times how is that different uh or applied to ac unit versus the soft start oh this is this is a great question you know and i was confused about this a year or two ago too because i had all kinds of people ask me tons of questions hard start soft start what does all of this kind of stuff mean um now i don't have a a graph up here of the exact thing but i'll show you what it does um so uh and in fact i applied hurdle my my high rate data logger to it and what i found was a hard start capacitor does distill the whole 52 amps and it does it for twice as long wow you can imagine it's not a storage thing that capacitor does not store electricity it's strictly about phase shift to get the magnetic flux spinning in the right direction that's all it is so it's not a storage thing at all okay um so what it does is it does that 52 amp peak but then it lasts for over a second in length that it's holding it so they really were used on old aging air conditioners they were having trouble starting and what it does is it kind of gives it a bigger kick in the butt right try to make a go now i've not done a bunch of extensive testing yet but from everything that i've seen on that everything i've seen says that it would make it even harder to start that air conditioner if you were in a limited power situation um you know like a an inverter generator so more experiments to do subco though is a manufacturer that sent me a whole box full of them so um i got i have everyone that they debate i think so and they said test it and tell us what's going on and but we feel in many cases it helps and in some cases it may help but i don't think it's going to help you on a honda 2000 generator that's just my my how i'm seeing how all of this operates unless i'm doing something really really wrong and looking at it incorrectly but i'm pretty sure i understand what it's doing i think i think yeah but time will tell as you guys know you know i'm retired from my live gigs of climbing around and doing big rock concerts and everything and i can't really travel around the country do a lot of seminars so i'm stuck i'm stuck in my laboratory and it is turning into a real lab and so i can now answer these questions and do videos about them so this is what i'm wanting to do these are my my upcoming projects a lot of fun well mike i want to come visit your laboratory someday i always uh love talking to you and i always learn something when i when i talk to you uh and just so that that folks know that are listening uh i do uh as it relates to electricity and technology i do rely on mike on a lot of things as it relates to the internal workings of things to make sure that i am presenting the right information to our audience and so i appreciate your your time and your help i'll give you last word mike if you want to say say one more thing about uh soft start or anything else well if you if you want i have a little three minute video here that i could run that actually shows us how it works in real time yeah would you like to do that would you like to see that sure pop on over there and you can kind of see this and then we'll be done all right let me make sure that i'm sharing hang on one second let me make sure i'm sharing this with the sounds because that's always embarrassing shared with sound there we go and this is stuff that i did in my own lab so it didn't come from some um you know manufacturers thing okay this is a video showing the peak currents comparing a stock capacitor in a dometic penguin two air conditioner with the soft start rv modification the left graph shows you the peak current from the stock capacitor the right graph meter is going to show us the peak current after the soft start rv modification let's take a quick look a little too fast to see isn't it okay so the left one the left meter is going to show us the 52 amp peak current that we get with the stock capacitor we can see that's in red the right graph is going to show us the 24 peak from soft start rv and that's the graph in yellow now it's a little hard to see so i'm going to slow that down a bit here's our fan running right here is going to be our peak you can see it's going to redline the meter for a stock capacitor comes back down to around 14 amperes or so which is what normally you have with a regular air conditioner running that's all good but that 52 amp peak is what causes a lot of air conditioners to trip generators and receptacles that may have limited amounts of power let's go look at the soft start rv side of it you can see again it's going pretty fast let's do it slow it down here we're at the 4 amp fan draw it's going to take a lot longer to build up and it's only going to build up to 24 amps peak comes back down to this around the same 14 amps or so of running so the difference between the two technologies is you have a very short peak current of 52 amps of stock capacitors and you have a much longer drawn out time with a lower amperage for soft start rv now this okay so let's just head back out of there but does that i think you know this is the kind of stuff i enjoy doing because again i'm building all the gadgetry to do it but this shows you the difference so in the next time if somebody asks you how one of these things works you can say well does slower current let less current for a little bit longer time um and um it just makes everything just work much easier well it it's it's one of the most well thought out demonstrations of something like this that uh that i've ever seen so i'm i know people will be thankful that you've taken the time to uh put that together uh hey mike where where can people you got a facebook page that i go to where's all that stuff at if you go to um if you go to facebook uh the the rv electricity group um all all my stuff is over there um and we have a very very active i'm over ten thousand uh users now ten thousand on our facebook group and we run it with an iron fist i mean you know there's nobody yells at anybody nobody calls anybody names they get one shot and they're gone yes um also all my videos are over on my youtube channel which is also aptly named rv electricity uh you can also find tons and tons of my articles over on rvtravel.com and i do a regular column there every saturday on my rv electricity column and i also do a thing on mondays which i call my jam session just ask mike yeah get it jam jam sessions that's good and you can see a little bread with jam on it you know strawberry jam and i have hundreds and hundreds of articles this is my tenth year of actually uh writing for the rv industry um and so i've got many many hundreds of articles out there you can find almost anything about generators ac powers now i'm diving more into batteries and solar hybrid inverters oh i got lots to learn i'm retired from my regular job so now i'm getting in trouble you know in my shop well all good hey i'm along for the ride i i got uh uh located you early on in my uh rving tour uh with your with your book and and read through that and then soon after that i guess we got introduced uh probably at the hershey show i guess and and uh and so i've been along for the ride ever since and i'm looking forward to seeing what all you have going on in the future so uh i appreciate taking time and hey we should do this again yeah we will this is all great thank you everybody for taking the time to watch us and thank you eric for inviting me along for the ride yep

electrical o ninety let's talk about that this is what we're going to cover today what is electrical o ninety first basic electrical terms different electrical systems in the RV and tips to protect your RV from bad power so these are the things that we're going to to cover today so what is electrical o nineteen so you know when you get out of high school you go to college and you go to English 101 well there's also a course called English o 90 and and that is if if you don't really qualify to just go straight into to 101 and you need a little more help with your writing skills they send you in 200 ninety so this is the basic of all basics that you could get as it relates to electricity in your RV if you're an electrical engineer you might be a little bit bored but I feel like that that it's important that all our viewers learn these simple basics about electricity and how it relates to your RV so we're really going to get into that at a very basic level today so here's the things that we're going to get into as it relates to electrical terms we're going to talk about volts amps and and watts we're going to talk about 30 and 50 amp RVs and we're going to just we're going to talk about wattage availability as well so let's get right into that so we know that electricity is the flow of an electrical charge and that electrical charge begins with voltage so what is voltage so here's my example here if you look on the screen here the the red faced frowning face here where is an electron okay and I made it an angry face because it's negative right and this is how I remember it so maybe it'll help you here so a negatively charged electron okay this is the basis for voltage and so if I get a lot of negatively charged electrons all tightly pressed together then they're going to want to repel against themselves so if you think about it like magnets unlike poles attract and like poles repel so if I get a lot of negatively charged electrons tight together in a single environment they're going to want to repel each other because they they are like poles just like a magnet so how do these electrons come to be like in a battery it's a it's a chemical reaction in like solar panels it's photons from the Sun we won't get into a whole lot of that but just remember voltage is negatively charged electrons and the more of those that you push together into a small space the more they want to repel against each other and the closer they're pushed together the larger the force between them grows this force that we're talking about is electrical tension and the higher the pressure on that electrical tension the higher the voltage if I can get that voltage high enough then I'll have the electricity that I need to run the components in my RV let's take a battery as an example remember creating these electrons within a battery is a chemical reaction and let's go ahead and fill this battery up with negatively charged electrons now you can imagine once that battery gets full the electrons are wanting to flow but they have nowhere to go at this point right but all of those electrons in there that's the pressure that's the voltage if I give that those electrons a circuit from one pole to another Pole what's going to happen there immediately going to take that path as you can see that flow of the voltage across that circuit is measured in amps okay so we talked about voltage and now we're talking about amps so amps is the flow of those electrons across a circuit so remember volts measures the pressure or the force under which electrons move and amps measures the amount of electrons passing a given point every second that's the current right but what's a watt all these are terms of measurement a watt measures the usage of electrical power so let's take that battery again we've got we've got the battery full right we've charged it to the to its max and we've got the flow of current now and then let's say we just light up a light bulb this currents going through our r.v our electrical outlets we plug a lamp in the light bulb comes on that light bulb is is in what it absorbs in electricity is measured in watts okay so have you ever tripped a breaker in your RV if you've RV long enough then the answer to that's probably yes why does that happen right so we're using so many different components in our RV and obviously if you use more than what is available then breakers are in place to protect you so if you're using more draw than is allowed then that breaker will trip so but why is that and that's because of you can see these components here on the screen and one thing you may notice about the user these are all like heat producing components and those are the ones that require the most watt watts to operate so like sometimes you might see like a hairdryer and on the side of it it might say like 1700 watts and so that means it needs 700 watts in order to to run that so it's all about watts and making sure that you don't draw more than your RV is designed for so here is a formula that I never thought that I would ever care about or need to know anything about whenever I just lived in a sticks and bricks home but in an RV this formula becomes very important and it's volts we know what that is now right times amps equals watts so let's look at how this formula plays out as it relates to your RV the volts is a should be a steady number okay 120 volts is what we're looking for right now you might be at 118 you might be at 122 but as it relates to this formula you should make the assumption that you can hold a hundred and twenty volts so that number will always stay at 120 times amps you're either in a 30 amp RV or you're in a 50 amp RV so if you're in a 30 amp RV and you know you're running in a hundred and twenty volts you multiply those together and you have 3600 watts of availability now if you have a hairdryer that pulls 1,500 watts then you can just subtract that from that 3600 watts and whatever's remaining there is what you have left that you can use in your RV so you start thinking of all the components that you have in your RV and in a 30 amp RV 3600 watts is is the number that you need to stay below now 50 amp RV is a little bit different because you still have a hundred and twenty volts but in a 50 amp RV you have 220 volt lines that are split to each side of your RV and so it's it's really a hundred and twenty times two of those lines times now 50 amps that's 12,000 watts of availability so if I just did 120 volts times 50 amps that would be 6000 but there's two of those lines so it's 12,000 watts of availability that's why these big RVs have the you know you get three air conditioner units you get like the the cool fireplace the big residential refrigerators and so that's why they can do this is because they have 220 volt lines times 50 amps so keep that in mind it's very important especially if you're in a 50 amp RV and there's only a 30 amp pedestal available because you're used to consuming a lot of power but now if you're gonna plug into that 30 amp pedestal now you're back down to 3600 Watts right so this is why it's important for an RV or to kind of understand this this formula and this isn't something that's like oh hey I just learned this and I'll never think about this again as an RVer this is something that you should be considering when you were at an RV park and understanding the power consumption and what you have available to you so let's look at some common electrical items in your RV and you can just kind of browse this list right here but you'll probably notice that again the the heat producing items really eat up the wattage you know that microwave oven your your coffeemaker toasters know your air conditioner units some big RVs have like washers and dryers in them if you're gonna plug in a portable heater then you're going to need to know it's wattage and do you have that availability some time ago Tami and I were we had a 5th wheel and we had this little space heater that we would use from time to time and we would plug it into a wall outlet and the breaker would pop and so but what would happen is if I would unplug it from that receptacle and I would go to the other side of my RV and plug it into a receptacle over there then all the sudden everything was good so why is that and again it's that 50 amp RV remember it's got 220 volt lines coming into it so what I was doing is I was unplugging from this line plugging into the other side that actually had more availability for me on the other side of the RV so if you're ever tripping a breaker on one side by plugging something in you could try the other side and see if you have more availability on the other side of your RV so an RV electrical system has basically two types of power and for the most part and that is one is called direct current or DC and that means the current is direct in one direction and then the other one is called AC and that's alternating current sort of this back and forth thing so to remember that DC and AC you're going to be using them both in your RV so let's take a closer look at that so on the AC side what is that and where does it come from so AC comes from your power lines that power pedestal that you you plug into and your DC power comes from your batteries now also if you have a generator your RV will see the power coming from a generator the same as those power lines it's AC power ok so whether it's power lines or a generator that's AC DC that's coming from your batteries so which items in your RV typically run off of the AC power so your air conditioners it's it's usually your your power hogs are what runs off AC power and so your air conditioner your wall outlets because you may have a microwave plugged into a wall outlet your TV's your residential refrigerators the big residential refrigerators will be AC washers dryers again energy hogs or gym early AC type items your DC items those things that are powered from your battery bank are things like your your lights fans some slides like the water pumps some refrigerators not the big Residential's but some refrigerators will be DC power as well so I love this slide right here because it shows the flow of power into your RV and how everything from your AC items to your DC items or power like how does this happen I'm plugging in to shore power in this example right here or I'm running off my generator because again remember those are both AC this is the originating source in this example right here I pull into an RV park I plug my RV into the power pestle so the power comes in from the shore power it goes through a transfer switch which if you have a generator a transfer switch basically manages the power between your power pedestal and if you have a generator if you don't have a generator you're not gonna have a transfer switch like this so but let's say you do and but you're plugged into a shore power it goes through the transfer switch and from there the power goes to the breaker box so wherever your breaker box is everybody should know where that is in their RV and if you don't you should go look for it but you've got a breaker box so that power goes shore power to the breaker box from the breaker box it goes out and powers all of those AC dependent items in your RV so this is gonna be your outlets your AC's all these things we talked about that are AC now if my originating source for power in my RV is AC the power pole right how in the world am I going to power my DC dependent items when I only when my originating source is AC so let's follow the logic here the power comes in for my DC items that AC power is going to hit something called a converter this converts power from AC to DC power from that converter it goes to your batteries this is going to keep your batteries nice and charged up right from your batteries it's going to go to a fuse panel so AC power goes to the breakers DC power goes to fuses like in a car you have a fuse panel in your car so you have this in your RV as well for your DC power once it hits the fuse panel from there it goes out and powers your DC dependent items in your RV that is the flow of electricity if you're in an RV park and you're plugged into Shore power in this next example let's say you're off the grid and you're running on battery power you're not plugged into that Shore power only battery I still got a power my DC items and I need to power my AC items so how in the world does that work well let's take a look at it your batteries the power from your batteries goes to your fuse panel just like it didn't when you had AC power it's going to your fuse panel and from your fuse panel it goes and powers your DC dependent items nothing really changed there but for the AC dependent items power goes from your battery to something called an inverter a converter transitioned AC to DC an inverter transitions DC to AC power so from the inverter it goes to my breaker box and then to my AC dependant items now if you don't have a way to keep that battery charged up and you're running a lot of AC dependent items it's going to be a short trip okay so a lot of people may use like solar panels and things like that or run a generator to keep their their battery charged yes solar power some people do wind power and that that is converted to keep that battery level high so that you can continue to stay off the grid another option there is you can turn your vehicle on and and charge your battery but that is not always recommended because that happens through the alternator in your vehicle and an alternator is really designed to kind of keep a battery topped off so only use that as a last resort because if your battery is like really low and then you're gonna turn your vehicle on and try and charge it with your alternator that alternator is gonna run a lot hotter because now it's trying to charge a battery up from like a low level and the that doing that over and over would reduce the life of your alternator this is just a funny I saw this somewhere touching wires causes instant death $200 v so I don't know who came up with that but again the point here is don't touch live wires it can cause death and apparently in New Castle you will get charged $200 after you die what can go wrong with power so we know kind of how power is generated we know how it flows through our RV now we know about availability and all that about like hey I'm in a 30 amp or a 50 amp how much wattage availability do I have so what could go wrong well unfortunately a lot you can have low voltage and high voltage type issues you can have surges of course and you can just have poor electrical wiring at a campground just to name a few so when you go and plug in to a RV parks pedestal there should not be an assumption ever that that is stable solid properly wired power and if you've RVD long enough then you know this the most common thing that our viewers will experience is low voltage and we'll talk about that in a little bit but let's talk about some of the common pedestal problems that you can have you can have a open ground situation and we're going to talk specifically about each one of these open neutral accidental 240 reverse polarity power surges high and low voltage let's look at these individually on a 50 amp wiring remember you've got two hot lines and you've got a ground and you've got a neutral if you have an open ground situation this means that the ground wire is not connected or it's not corrected proper connected properly and it can certainly cause serious injury a ground is there to expel excess energy if you have some kind of spike or something that excess energy needs to go somewhere you want that excess energy to go to ground if there's no ground it's going somewhere this means that it can charge something in your RV that shouldn't be charged with electricity and it can create an electrocution situation you need to have a proper ground and at the RV parks the pedestal it should have a proper ground open neutral situation okay so now the neutral line is improperly wired it's missing completely in a 50 amp RV you have 220 volt lines coming in they share one neutral and the neutral line is the return path the power comes in it needs a return path to go back out and it's all the way back to the service panel if you're if if you lose that neutral in between your 50 amp lines those two 50 amp lines can come together and create 240 volts usually the way it will present itself is on one side of your RV you may have 200 volts instead of 120 and on the other side you may have 40 volts so you know both sides are in trouble certainly the side that is 200 volts is anything in its path it's it's going to destroy so if you've got a computer plugged into a wall outlet or something like that it's going to be a problem so losing the neutral line is not good and it can certainly destroy electronic components in your RV pretty quickly reverse polarity this is when the hot and the neutral lines are wired in Reverse now this can happen at the pedestal and if this happens at the power pedestal if somebody had wired that improperly that means everything in your RVs now in in a reverse polarity status the problem with this is is things will still work let's take an outlet for example that that the hot and the neutral line is is reversed what'll happen is is you let's say you've got a toaster plugged into that outlet that has reverse polarity and the toaster is in the off position because it's the the wires are reversed even though that toasters in the off position the coils could still be laughs so you're you make some toast it pops the toast gets stuck in there and and although you should never stick a fork or a knife in there to get your toast out let's say you do you go in there and you've got a reverse polarity situation that would not be good power surges when you think about electricity certainly the most terrifying thing that you can think about is a power surge a lightning strike you know something that there's just a lot of electricity storms coming through this can also happen because of the power company having equipment problems it's just this instant spike it lasts only for just a split second and then it's gone but in that split second it can really just destroy everything in its path power surges are not that common we did a survey not too long ago and just asked there was three thousand participants in this survey and the number of people that had had experienced like a true power surge like lightning and hit close by it was like under two percent now if that happens a lot of times there's not a whole lot you can do because power surges can come up through like the the jacks in your RV I mean there's just all kinds of things that can happen chances are you're gonna have a problem with electronics in your RV if you take an extreme spike and you haven't protected your RV with some kind of surge protection low and high voltage okay this is the most common thing that our viewers will experience in an RV park specifically low voltage so we get in an RV park it's a packed Park it's in the middle of the summer everybody's cranking their ACS on that voltage comes down the electronic components in your RV are designed to be operated optimally at a particular range so low voltage would be considered anything below 102 to 104 or something like that now we like 120 but anything below that 102 104 range that's considered low voltage that could be damaging to your the electronic components in your RV and the problem with low voltage is this there's rarely a time that there's an immediate cause-and-effect from when you have a low-voltage situation and your microwave goes out but what does happen is low voltage reduces the life of your electronic components so now you wake up one morning your microwave doesn't work you don't have anything to attribute it to so you just think hey my microwave just it's at the end of its life well it could be that you've been experiencing low voltage and you reduce the life of your microwave and one morning you get up and it's just not working so we got to protect ourselves against that to keep that in mind low voltage very important for us to protect ourselves from low voltage in our RVs how can you protect yourself so the experienced our viewers are going to know this knew our viewers don't know this some people don't care and don't think that that it's an issue power at RV parks if you travel enough will be a problem at some point or another so you needed a device in between you in your RV and the power from that power pestle so I personally use in my RV the surge guard brand electrical protection system so there's units out there that are just surge guard units surge surge units they'll protect you against a surge but you remember I said that's really not that that's not the most common thing what we want to do is make sure that we get something that can identify low voltage high voltage miswired pedestals and that's what a total electrical protection system will do some companies call it total electrical protection some called energy management systems you may see the term EMS there's all different kinds of terms for it all means the same thing they're all marked marketing terms it just means that it's going to do way more than just protect you against surge and that is what you need for your RV let's take a look at it a little closer and I'm going to be talking specifically about the surge guard unit because that's what I use if you know anything about techno RV first of all we only sell at techno RV comm what we what we use we most of the unit's out in the market on a particular item that we're going to sell we determine what we think is the best and then that's what we use there's certainly other brands out on the market you might see progressive and Hughes and and even camcos another brand but I personally believe that surge guards the best unit on the market for a lot of reasons we'll talk about that here's what this does a total electrical protection system when you plug it into the to the pedestal and then you plug your RV into the total electrical protection system and then turn the breaker on it's going to analyze the pestle it is going to that this this analysis of the pedestal will take about 10 seconds some other units on the market may take 136 seconds some take 128 the surge guard takes about 10 seconds in that 10 seconds it's checking to make sure you've got a proper neutral a proper ground no reverse polarity issues in making sure at the time that you don't have any high or low voltage issues immediately all those things that I just explained about problems that open neutral open ground reverse polarity all these issues that I just said that can be a problem they're not a problem anymore because let me tell you something if you plugged a surge Guard unit in in it in that particular pedestal is missing the ground it's not gonna let power through to your RV a message is gonna come up and say you got an open ground you're gonna go to the manager of the park and be like this has got an open ground they'll either send an electrician out or they're gonna move you to another spot then you should insist on it actually so all those wiring issues problem resolved with a total electrical protection system it's gonna protect against surges as well now a surge again is that instant spike right we do want to protect ourselves from that even though that is not the most common thing that would happen to you you do want to protect yourself against that so so a surge Protection Unit can absorb excess energy of a spike through something called a moth mov it's a it's a metal oxide varistor and depending on how many of those moths are put into a particular surge guard unit and how much excess energy each moth can absorb will determine how much of a spike that that particular unit can handle the surge guards is the surge Guard units have one of the highest levels of protection on the market based on how many movs they have in their units and so I like that about them alright so we talked about this low and high voltage protection and low voltage being the more common thing that can happen to you in an RV park and we talked about why these units these total electrical protection systems will identify if your voltage drops below a safe level that's safe for your electronic components in your RV if you drop below that level it's going to cut you off from that these are usually short-term events and these units will reanalyze power and once that voltage comes back up then it will cut your power back onto your RV so if you're gone for the day and this event were to happen maybe you've got a pet in the RV or something yes these units are designed to come back on should they cut you off from from low voltage or these high voltage situations and again low voltage would be anything below around 102 and high voltage would be considered anything above 132 so see high voltages is different than than a surge surge is that boom split second a huge spike where high voltages just like anything above like say around 132 volts now here's one of the reasons that I like the surge guard unit it's the only unit on the market that gives you something called load side protection and what that means is is that this unit can not only protect you against things on the line side that means that things coming from the pedestal but it also protects you against things on the load side which means inside your RV so if you had a scenario where you had elevated ground currents or an open neutral condition inside of your RV the surge guard unit will be able to identify that and cut you off from it remember a 50 amp RV if you lose that neutral those 50 amp lines are coming together and creating 240 volts you need to be able to be cut off from that or you will certainly have some electronics that are not going to be in good shape so again the surge guard unit is the only system on the market that will do that and it's one of the main reason among among other things it's one of the main reasons that I believe surge guard is the best unit on the market the surge guard also has a dual line display on the unit it's going to tell you how many volts per line that you have so should be 120 but you know you know you could have 115 or 125 or just whatever the voltage is it's going to tell you purloined and then also how many amps are you drawing off of each line so it will tell you that as well so that is good information to know considering now that we know kind of that whole formula volts times amps equals watts you're going to be able to know now the voltage and the amperage that you're drawing from that line surge guard has the best warranty on the market hands now it's another reason I love it it's got a lifetime warranty it's considered a limited lifetime warranty and what that means is that for a lifetime if there's any components or craftsmanship or anything that aren't operating up to the standard of what it should be then that's that's just covered for a lifetime but it has what's called connected equipment coverage and what that means is that is this unit they also do what it was intended to do and because it failed to do what it was intended to do something in your RV got damaged like a microwave or something like that surge guard the company will actually pay for the cost of whatever that was so great great warranty so that is the surge guard total electrical protection system certainly if you have more questions about that then you can call techno RV you can chat with us you can email with us right from our website and again techno RV comm we've got more information on electrical protection we've got info guides on our site so listen I hope that this seminar was helpful to you", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-06-11T22:45:00Z", "channelId":

{"id": "P3Vw7WHFWhM", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "04xPE7LOithj7Bcid99AxSdGjT8", "transcript": "hey this is Eric at techno RV and in this video I want to talk to you about cellular boosters kind of how they work and why you might need one so if you travel around enough and an RV and you need to stay connected and you like to stay connected with a cellular signal well you're likely going to find yourself in areas from time to time where you have poor cell signal now this could be because you're you're too far from the cell tower it could be because you've got too many obstructions between you in the cell tower or it could be just because in this particular situation you might be in that even the walls of your RV could be creating interference and so a cellular booster can help with all of that and I want to talk to you about the weboost brand cellular boosters they're the industry standard I've been full time RVing since 2015 a run techno RV from the road and I absolutely wouldn't be able to do it without my we boost cellular booster we depend on it greatly and so here is the concept behind a cellular booster now before I get into the concept I do want to tell you I've got an open box video that kind of describes everything that's in this kit but I've pulled out the three main components just so I can talk to you about again the concept behind a cellular booster so in these kits you're gonna have an outside antenna now this kit also has a couple of posts here that screw on so to give you something to install onto like a ladder rack or I actually put mine on to a PVC pole and then put it up on my RV with a antenna suction cup mount that we have a techno our V as well but anyway this is the outside antenna this antenna is going to bring in a weak signal from the local cell tower it's gonna bring that weak signal inside through this cable now the kit comes with more cable than this to get you inside but the cable is going to run inside of your RV inside of your RV you're gonna have this amplifier this is the engine behind it all right here it's a 50 DB gain booster 50 DB gain is the most allowed boost by the FCC for a sale booster that's that's designed to be used while in motion so the cable from your outside antenna will come inside and it will basically screw in and connect to the amplifier that sits in your RV on the side that says outside antenna so that makes it real easy out of the other side of this booster you're going to connect an inside antenna so again there's more cable that comes with this but the little desk top booster here inside antenna just comes with a little pigtail here so you would take the excess cable and connect it to the other side of the booster then you're going to give it power just AC power it's fine it comes with an AC and DC power supply but let's just say you plugged it into a wall outlet weak signal comes in gets boosted through the amplifier and then a a boosted sale signal gets rebroadcast into your RV from the desk top antenna it creates this sort of boosted zone in your RV almost like bringing a part of the cell tower from outside into your RV this boosted zone that it creates the size of that boosted zone is dependent on the originating signal itself that boosted zone could be a couple of feet it could be eight to ten feet the reason that there's a variance is because if you're taking a really really weak signal and then boosting it it's it's not going to create a large boosted zone maybe a couple of feet think of it like a megaphone you know if you whisper into a megaphone it's really not going to project that far but the more you start raising your voice the more it really starts projecting and that is a similar concept to this inside antenna right here if you've got pretty decent cell signal outside and it's getting boosted even more by the amplifier then again I mean you could have four or five six seven eight feet of a boosted zone now if you have a smaller boosted zone that's okay because what I do is I use like little hotspots like I use a Verizon and AT&T hotspot one of those little pucks that you can get from the local Verizon or AT&T store or you can make your phone a hotspot and then what I do is I take those hotspots and I just set them right in front of this desktop booster here now I know it's in the boosted zone right because I've just set it here you know six eight inches from it so that device is now boosted now I can go anywhere in my RV with my computer or cell phone and wirelessly connect back to the device that I have sitting inside of that boosted zone now this boosts voice data and texting so it will certainly help you with drop phone calls it'll actually increase the battery life on your devices as well because if you have a stronger signal then your phone is actually not having to work as hard there so it can actually save some battery life for you and and that is how these units work now when you go to install them you will have a choice do you want to permanently mount your outside antenna if you do that you're you're likely have to drill some holes in your RV to get the cable in that's not what I do I prefer not to drill holes in my RV if I don't have to and so again I use the technology in ten a suction cup mount I use a one inch by five foot schedule 40 PVC pol I put it in that suction cup mount and then I put this antenna on top of that PVC pol line-of-sight is always good for a cellular signal and getting that antenna higher in the air can only help things so when I put my unit up this antenna is usually 3 4 feet above my RV so that helps me as well that is how a RV cellular kit works it's a very very simple and it will certainly boost that cellular signal for you now a techno RV we also have home cellular boosters and and you can find those at techno RV as well same concept outside antenna amplifier boosts it except these home systems have these bigger inside antennas and they can they can really boost the cellular signal in a home you know I mean 1,500 2,000 square feet there's some variables there that you have to look at we can help you with that we consult people all the time you call in to techno RV you can talk to us about that one more thing I wanted to mention about the RV kit we sell something called the cellular booster bundle that comes with this kit here and everything you meet the bundle adds two antennas and it adds this is this is going to be if you're in say a truck and you're towing 5th wheel bumper pull this system here is going to be set up in your RV but what if you want this to be used inside of your passenger vehicle you can certainly do that now you could just move this whole system but the easiest thing to do is just to add a love antennas to the system so our bundle includes a little mini magnetic mount antenna this is designed just pop on the top of your car and it also includes a little flat chocolate bar style inside antenna so all you would have to do is just move this amplifier back and forth between your RV and your passenger vehicle now the kit comes with an AC power supply and a DC power supply so you've got a couple of different power supplies there to work so my recommendation well it depends on your situation but a lot of people will use that DC power supply in their car and then they'll use the AC power supply in their RV so that's the cellular booster bundle that includes the extra antennas there and so I hope that's been helpful that's kind of everything you need to know about how a cellular booster works and you get it all at techno RV comm", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-06-08T22:35:30Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "WeBoost RV and Home Cell Booster Overview", "description":

{"id": "em-y_u8sbdU", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "WXhBPUN0k4BsngUYoMzGCVyPmbs", "transcript": "hey this is Eric over at techno RV calm and in this video we want to talk about Garmin RV specific GPS is when I first started RVing one of my bigger concerns was a my RV is kind of big here is it okay for me to just drive wherever I want to and the answer to that is no there's certain roads that are not designed for bigger RVs and an RV specific GPS kind of takes the guesswork out of that for you in addition it does a lot more for you even if you've got a smaller RV and that's not a concern for you so again I'm a full-time RVers I used the Garmin GPS is there's two current models on the market right now there's one called the 785 and the 780 essentially the navigational functions between the two are the same there are some differences in the two mainly being that the 785 comes with a built in dash camera in the 780 does not there are a few other differences and if you go to techno RV comm and go to the Garmin page we've actually got a little chart that you can look at and go line by line and and check that out on the differences between the two in this video I'm going to do some demonstrations on the 785 and because I just want to kind of give you an overview of of what it does and and how you just kind of go in and do some navigating with the unit so let's go ahead and take a look at the Garmin 785 all right this is the 785 here and when you get these units the very first thing that you want to do is you want to enter your vehicle's information and so just to show you real quickly how to do this and again there's a lot of different ways that you can do some of the things that I'm about to show you and so this really is not necessarily a training video but more of just an overview so if I go into vehicles here as you can see there is a Motorhome set up in here this is actually mine and so you can see I've I've already got it set that it's 13 feet tall eight feet six inches wide 60 feet long that includes my Jeep if I want to make some adjustments to this I just hit the little wrench at the bottom and as you can see I can just scroll through here and make adjustments to that so if I want me to adjust my height I would just go in there and if I was say thirteen five say oops then I would just do that and hit save and now it says that I'm 13 five your width your overall length again that includes everything going down the road if you've got a Toby hick or if you're a truck and a fifth wheel or a bumper pull how much you weigh kind of all in the max speed is a is interesting so you know you go out west and there's speed limits out there that are 80 miles an hour so if you're like well I'm not gonna go 80 miles an hour ever in my RV let's say the most you'll ever go is say 67 you can enter 67 and that will adjust your arrival times based on that that's going to be your max speed no matter what also if you have propane tanks this is where you would enter them my RV currently is is an all-electric so I don't have propane tanks but if I did I would just hit an ADD tank and put the size of the tank and I can add as many tanks as I want essentially once you enter your RVs information you're ready to navigate now one thing that we do get asked some is that hey what if I want to transition this GPS to just a regular passenger vehicle and not take the height and weight into consideration absolutely you can do that you just hit car mode right here and then I would just hit select and then it's and you'll look down here at the vehicle it shows a little picture of a car and now it's just going to route me as a passenger vehicle I want to change that back to motorhome I just hit select and now it's got me at the motor home so again setting your V setting your RV up is really easy and that's how you do it all right now that was for a Motorhome and of course if you've got a bumper pull or a fifth wheel or something like that then what you were doing you can enter more than one RV in here and you would just hit the plus button and then essentially you're going to just say hey if you've got you know a truck with a fifth wheel you're gonna do vehicle and trailer or a bumper pull this is what you would do if you've got a Motorhome with a tow vehicle you're just gonna do the motorhome in the trailer and if you're just a Motorhome only then you'll just do that and then essentially it would be the same thing you would say hey what am i towing here I've got a fifth wheel and then you would it would start walking you through the height weight width and all of that good stuff so whatever you got it can handle it is the point here so once you've entered your vehicles information you're pretty much ready to navigate so you can just go to the where to button and this is all of your sort of navigational tools I guess so the go home that would just be whatever your home address is to enter just a specific address of where you want to go you just click address and it'll start asking you know the house number and the street address you've certainly got saved information in here where you've been recently a lot of times that can be helpful all of the campgrounds now this starts getting into more of like it's the the RV specific nature of these so this would be just showing me campgrounds in my area but I could also just enter a different city so if today I know that I'm going to a different city I would just hit a different city enter the city and then go back out and click campgrounds and then it would show me campgrounds in that city planned RV services your truck stops dump stations all this stuff is so useful for RVs and it is all in here your different categories a lot of these are RV specific and then some of them aren't so this also adds in your your campgrounds again just a different way to get to it wrist areas now you're just getting into restaurants what kind of attractions are in the air recreation type activities shopping in the area it's all in here national parks this is kind of cool here so if you're a big national part buff and then you can just put the city that you're going to you can go and you can get some great information like this is the Smoky Mountains it's got the different entrances it shows you exactly where the visitor centers are landmarks with in it it'll even show you like hikes that you can go do it's got a History Channel app here as well that shows you parks museums monuments historic buildings so when you get in an area if you're kind of at a loss of what to do you can just pull your Garmin out and it will kind of walk you through what's in the area okay so let's just go ahead and enter an address here so that I can just show you will do a campground oh I want to change my city here let's go we're gonna go to a different City and let's say we're gonna go to Tampa and we'll go to Tampa Florida and then once I've got Tampa in here now I can hit all campgrounds and then I'm just going to guess I'll just randomly pick one here here's Lazydays when you click on it you can click information and get all kinds of information it's got their phone number how many hookups they've got what their amenities are it'll show you that on all the campgrounds so that's pretty cool but anyway I'm just going to go ahead and hit go here and so that's this way I can show you what the the navigation screen looks like so everything on the screen is pretty much adjustable so if you see something on the screen you can just hit distance if you want to change that to time to destination or time to next stop or whatever you want to do you can do that when you're on your speed if you would if you click on that it kind of gives you a lot of information here about arrival times and you can do trip phase and trip me so that's kind of cool stuff as well if I if I just hit the top screen here it'll give me go ahead and give me a turn-by-turn so a lot of people like to look at that like right before they take off like hey I'm in this congested area and I really want to know what I'm doing here you can just click again I just click continue to snow road here and it pulled me my turn by turning up it's got a lot of capabilities as far as being able to adjust your route along the way also if I want to now find say a rest area along my route then I just hit the back button and go to where to and then I can just well I'm sorry we go to categories rest areas and then this is going to give me my rest areas along my route so that is good because it'll just say hey you know whatever in 80 miles you got a rest area 120 miles you got a rest here and then you choose the one you want that'll make that your next destination so I guess the point here is that the navigation screen has a lot of functionality and a lot of areas that you can customize as well if you click the three dots on the lower right hand corner some of this is just how to look at things differently you can certainly edit your route here you can do what's called route shaping to where you can literally if you know a particular area and you want to avoid something you can just tap the screen and change the road it does have a traffic module in this and if so if you're coming up on traffic then it will give you options on how to get around that traffic if there's something available you can accept that or not accept it let's go back down to the three dots it does have the ability to tap into cameras up ahead so there's these cameras all over the place now there will be at rest areas and I'll just along the interstate so if you click on cameras then it will and it's not going to do it here because I'm inside but but it could give you a list of cameras along your route and if you wanted to look like it or rest area up ahead and see like you know is it crowded is not crowded you could certainly do that also I mentioned on this 785 that it does have a built in dash camera so if I just go out here and click on that icon there you'll see where it says - camera up top here if I click on that then it's you know I can say start recording video and you can as you can see what it's showing on the screen now is basically just right out the front of it and I'm not going to do that but if I did then it would start recording and then whenever I went back out to my map screen to my navigation screen then it would just be recording in the background and then you could pull that information off whenever you like it does have auto looping so if you're recording out of the - camera out of the front of this unit then you the the SD card runs out of space it'll just start looping over old information so that is just a brief overview of the Garmin RV specific GPS we do these demonstrations at RV shows and as we do the demonstrations that's when just more questions may come up if you've got questions you can certainly put them in the comments of this video and we'll be sure to answer those in addition if you go to techno RV comm on our product pages we've got a lot of information on these units you can also call chat or email with us Monday through Friday we have people on the phone that are super knowledgeable at these systems here in addition when you buy your unit from techno RV comm you're going to get what's called the techno RV learning series and these are specific videos that we've put together to show you how to do certain things this was an overview this was not show you how to do it type video but whenever you get our learning series videos that is going to be very detailed on here is where you go to do this particular function and so I hope this was helpful I hope that if you're interested in a garment that you

{"id": "Tm859Osq_5A", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "O7S7IGpf3g3_-66CjC86yxtW5cc", "transcript": "hey this is Eric over at techno RV calm I'm a full time RV and I wouldn't travel anywhere without a tire-pressure-monitoring system so in this video I want to give you the details on the TST tire pressure monitoring system so the first thing that you need to know just as kind of an overview is that when you're using a tire pressure monitoring system you're essentially going to have a sensor that screws on to each valve stem and then that's going to broadcast forward to a monitor that's going to sit with you and your truck or RV and that is going to give you your pressure and your temperature of each tire position so why is it important to have both pressure and temperature the reason that it's important is because most blowouts are preceded by low pressure and high temperature you get a nail in your tire your tire starts to get low pressure that drives the heat up on the tire and ultimately high heat is what kills a tire boom that's when you have a blowout if you can be alarmed of these conditions as they're occurring then it will oftentimes give you time to pull off the side of the road and deal with the issue before the blowout occurs okay so we know that the sensor is going to give you that pressure and temperature but what happens if you have an issue well if you have a high temperature or a low pressure condition or a rapid pressure release then you're going to get alarmed so if you take a look at this monitor here it's already showing that it's an alarm it shows that it's low pressure it's showing you the wheel position that is in alarm which it's already started scrolling now so it's actually off that position but when you go into alarm that tire position will start blinking you'll get an audible alarm and a visual alarm and to silence the audible alarm you just hit any button on the front of the monitor and that'll silence the audible alarm but you're gonna continue to get the little red LED light flashing showing you're in alarm and and that's going to remain until you resolve whatever you're in alarm for so when you go into alarm again you know the exact tire position that's in alarm you know the exact point of data that's in alarm gives you time to get off the road you can go right back to that position and resolve whatever the issue is another awesome feature of the TST is that it auto Scrolls if you look at this unit right here you'll see a tire position that's blinking and every five seconds or so it'll move to the next tire position whichever tire position is blinking that's the data that you're getting so you see you have your your temperature and your pressure here and then again it's just auto scrolling what this does and it is an awesome feature is that it means that while I'm driving at a quick glance I can always see what's going on now I don't have to really keep an eye on it anyway because I do know that it's going to alarm if I have an issue but myself and RV years alike we like to see that data so as I'm driving down the road my tires kind of start heating up just from the ambient temperature I kind of like seeing that it lets me know what my tires are doing in real time you do have some sensor choices with the TST system and so you either have a what's called a cap sensor which is basically just a little low-profile little button sensor or you can have what is called a a flow-through sensor here and the the cap sensor is about an inch tall and the flow through sensors about two inches there if you can see that and the difference in these two is that the flow-through sensor allows you to air up your tire through the sensor right without taking it off of the valve stem and so that's the advantage of the flow-through sensor now you do need metal valve stems if you're going to use a flow-through sensor whereas a cap sensor can go on a metal valve stem or a rubber valve stem you can mix and match these for example on my class a Motorhome I use the flow-through sensor i TOA and i have cap sensors on my tow vehicle it's always recommended that you use cap sensors on a tow vehicle usually because the wheel wells are shallower and this lower profile sensor works better and often times a tow vehicle has rubber valve stems as well so keep that in mind you can mix and match like I said whenever I had a 5th wheel and I was towing my 5th wheel with the f-350 my fifth wheel had metal valve stems and it kind of had some deeper wheel wells and I did use the the flow-through sensors but a lot of times people with 5th wheels prefer caps it's really a preference thing on that just know that the the main standard that you need to be abiding by is only metal valve stems for the flow-through caps can be rubber or metal now this video is just an overview video I have a lot more videos on techno RVs youtube channel and on our product pages at techno RV comm about the sensors their their measurements how much they weigh any details that you want to know about this system I've got a video on it but this is an overview and so so that gives you enough information there about these now in addition both of these sensors do have anti-theft features and for both of them the way that works is that each sensor will come with a brass nut I've got a video on this too you screw this brass nut onto the valve stem and then you screw the since Iran after that and then you'll have a little tool that comes with the kit that you just Boop lock the brass nut back up against the sensor and it essentially just locks it onto your valve stem so if somebody came by and tried to take it off they wouldn't be able to now the thing about the anti-theft you can use it or you don't have to use it if you're like now I really don't want to mess with doing that you don't have to these are not going to just come off of your of your valve stem if you don't do that but if you like the extra security of the anti-theft feature then absolutely the TST system does come with that now another thing to know about these sensors is and I guess it would be expected but they're completely weatherproof obviously these are in some harsh conditions they're out on your valve stem so any type of weather or anything they completely can handle it and so what you don't want to do is completely submerge these so if you have a boat that you are wanting to put sensors on then TST actually has a marine sensor so we've talked about the cat we've talked about the flow-through and now here is a a marine sensor and what this is is this is a laser sealed sensor and so if this was on a boat trailer then it could be submerged and it would be completely fine so keep that in mind most of the time for RVs you're looking at that cap sensor and that flow-through sensor is going to be what you'll get for your RV but again if you wanted the marine sensor for a marine application then it certainly has it because the marine sensor is laser sealed there is a battery in here and it's a four plus year battery life it's not user replaceable so that means that this battery will last about four years and then it's yet you just throw it away and you just go buy another one so also on the marine sensor it does not have an anti-theft feature so you would just put this on say your boat trailer you can use it for RVs too if you'd like if you just like the idea that it's got a long life battery in it but again the Marine does not have the anti-theft feature on it talked about the laser sealed here and the fact that it's not user replaceable batteries however the cap and the flow-through sensors that we just got through talking about they have user replaceable batteries in them so the cap takes a 2032 battery the flow-through takes a 1632 battery and they last about a year and then you just change them out most rvs our viewers love the idea that that once these batteries deplete you just open these sensors up put another one in and you're good for another year I've got videos on how to change the batteries on these so if you want to check that out and see how easy that is then you can go to our YouTube channel and check that out alright programming the system super easy techno RV if you've ever bought from us before you know that we owned on our products we provide something called the techno RV learning series so in addition not only do we have like this product knowledge information but we've also got like install videos and things that we've made just for you so when you buy your system from techno RV comm you're going to get all this by email so there's an instructions that come with the TST system but essentially you're programming each sensor to a particular tire position so that if you were to go into alarm you're gonna know which tire to go to so if you look at them at the monitor here you'll see on this one this is set up for my motorhome here and then my Jeep here you can put you can put over a hundred sensors on this system here and it can handle up to four different trailers so if you had a towable a boat so you know something else whatever then you could get sensors for each of those and this is going to automatically recognize which particular item that you're towing behind you does that automatically once they're programmed in so I'm not getting into all the program other than just let you know you can do it it's easy we sell these online all the time and our customers just program them up and they're happy with if you ever have any questions of course you can call us chat with us email us we're always happy to help you what about mounting options all right these kits are gonna come with everything that you need you're gonna get you're gonna get your your color monitor TST was was the first to market with a color monitor and they're very brilliant and and I like them they're easy to see keep in mind that any monitor that that you have that's on a dash if it gets direct sunlight of course we all know that that can wash out kind of a screen and make it a little bit difficult to see but I'm gonna say probably 95 percent of the time when I'm going down the road if the different angles of the Sun I've got great view to my TST and I can see all of my data just fine so how do we monitor these things the system comes with your monitor and it comes with a suction cup mount if you want to put it on a window when I had my f-350 I just put it on the front windshield in my class a I've done a couple of things before I have mounted it on my side window to where it's over here toward a quick glance I can see it in addition if you look down at this one here this little mat here this rubber dash pad that also comes with the system so it's easy to just set it up on your dash set the monitor up in it and you're good to go two mounting options you get so you get your monitor two mounting options as many sensors as you want you'll just put when you place your order techno RV you just notate how many sensors that you want whether it's cap flow through a combination of both you get all of your anti-theft locking nuts and you get a power supply so the power supply is USB it's a USB cable so you could just plug it straight into a USB but it's also got the little El Valle chunk on it too so if you have a cigarette lighter you can plug into that now the good thing about these monitors is I can get about 16 to 20 hours of continuous usage off the cable so I never leave mine plugged in while I'm going down the road it's one less cable hanging off the dash for me so while I'm driving down the road it's not plugged in if during a particularly of a trip I see that my battery indicator light is starting to go down which if you look on this screen here you can see the battery indicator right over here if I see that start to go down on a particular leg of a trip that night I'll give it a charge for three or four hours and I'm good for another 16 to 20 hours so you could do that how you want if you want to leave it plugged in all the times and you're welcome to do that that's just not how I do it so TST has a great warranty it's a three-year comprehensive warranty and what I mean by comprehensive is if anything is not working the way that it should be within that three-year period the company TST will take care of it they have a great customer service and they know our viewers and they know that if there's something wrong with your system that it needs to be resolved quickly now you get in your system from techno RV calm so you've got us to call for support as well so we help people we troubleshoot we help answer questions so you can always email chat with us or call in to us directly if there's something that we need to get TST involved with then we'll we'll certainly do that as well this little presentation here is pretty much the the demo that Tammy and I do at RV shows it's just a brief overview of the TST system and all its features I hope it answered all of your questions and if it didn't then you know you that you can call us email or chat with us and that we will answer any question that you have if you're ready to buy your TST system then you can certainly go to techno or v.com and do that and we also as our viewers know that we need to ship quickly so that's exactly what we do because we know our viewers are moving around so I hope you enjoyed learning everything that you need to know about the TST tire pressure monitoring system", "snippet":

{"id": "vIIqEbkD4fQ", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "SHL8xMj9AcXbIpTJtgouQvDYuXE", "transcript": "hey this is Eric over at techno RV so you've decided that you need a tire pressure monitoring system and in this video I'm just going to walk through a few considerations to help you make the decision on what type sensor that you need with your new system so the first decision is really simple how many tires do you want to monitor so if you're in a motorhome like the one behind me here and you're towing a vehicle then you're going to want to monitor all of the tires on the motorhome and the tires on the tow vehicle so the reason that you want to monitor the tires on the vehicle that you're towing behind your motorhome is because these motorhomes are so heavy you can have a blowout on your towed vehicle and you never even know it you're just dragging your vehicle down the road and one of your tires and blown out we hear it all the time people are driving down the road and a car pulls up next to them waves them down they pull over and realize that they've got a blown-out tire on that towed vehicle so with these tire pressure monitoring systems you want to monitor that towed vehicle and to make sure that your alarm should you have any problems if you're in a truck towing a bumper pull trailer or a fifth wheel then certainly you're going to want to monitor the tires on the RV that you're towing and then you'll need to decide do you want to monitor the truck tires if you have no tire pressure monitoring on the truck then the answer would absolutely be yes you want to monitor those tires some trucks come with tire pressure monitoring systems built into them and they only monitor pressure so these tire pressure monitoring systems that you're going to be getting for your RV also monitor temperature as well as pressure a lot of people like having all that information in one place on that monitor so even if you have a truck that's got tire pressure built into it you still might want to consider adding them to this system another reason that you might want to add sensors to your truck that already has a built in TPMS because you can manually adjust the alarm points on the pressure and the temperature and you're not able to do that a built-in system so that's another consideration so the next thing that you need to consider when determining which sensors to get with your system is what type of valve stems do you have there's going to be three types out on the market you're just going to have a metal and that's a very rigid valve stem you're going to have a rubber valve stem that is not rigid and then you're going to have kind of a hybrid it's it's kind of this half rubber half metal valve stem usually has like a rubber boot on it and and then a metal valve stem coming out of that now those can vary and how they are designed some of those have a real rigid feel to them and then some of them don't really have a rigid feel on them so the reason this is a consideration is because there's two types of sensors you have to choose from a flow-through sensor a sensor that allows you to air up your tire through the center without taking it off the valve stem or a cap sensor a flow-through sensor can only go on a rigid valve stem and that's going to be your metal valve stems and some hybrids can handle a flow-through sensor if you've got rubber valve stems your decisions made for you you're just going to get cap sensors all the way around so that makes that easy so let's just have a look at some of the different valve stems that you may see on different parties so let's look at a metal valve stem this is a super crv it's going to have these big 20 2.5 inch wheels this is going to be the same type tire that you'll find on a large Class A as well and you will find that these are going to have metal valve stems and the metal valve stems you'll notice are very rigid if you just put your fingers on this and try and shake it back and forth I mean it is just not moving and that is good that is a metal valve stem it's got good access to it and getting a sensor older that's going to be very easy so now it's just a matter of deciding what type of sensor would you want you've got a cap sensor that's going to be this lower profile sensor that will fit on to the valve stem very easily or you can have a flow-through sensor it's a little bit longer these are about two inches whereas the cap sensor is about one inch now in this scenario if you look kind of from the side here you'll see that the flow-through sensor is not extending out past the bolt pattern here so that's good so really this is just a preference thing at this point you can use either the flow-through sensor or you could use the cap sensor on this tire here all right this is a Class B that we're here looking at here and on this particular Class B it actually has rubber valve stems so here is the valve stem right here and if you look up in there you can see that it's rubber or I can just grab it and you see how easy that moves back and forth that means that is a rubber valve stem so in this case you would not be able to use the flow-through sensor because these are only designed for metal valve stems so you would not use that on this one you would however use the cap sensor which works just fine on a rubber valve stem and in this case I would just take off the valve cap here and I would just screw on the and probably in this case I would have to turn it a little bit see these are the type situations you get into and once I turn this on then it starts getting to where and then you'll want to make sure that's not and see that just fits perfectly right there it's not touching this outer rim it's not touching the inner rim so that is a perfect fit right there if that valve stem was any longer then this might hit this rim right here and then of course you would have to consider that if that happened I may actually have somebody change that out to a metal valve stem and then I could put a valve stem extender on it and maybe turn it outside of that hole but anyway that is how that works all right so this is the back duals of a Class B the front tires on this Class B have rubber valve stems so you would need to put the cap sensor on that the back duals interestingly enough our metal valve stems so you could use cap or flow-through and they have them pointed out perfectly this isn't going to be the case on all class B's and we'll look at some different configurations but if you look at this one you've got your inside duel up here and that's a metal valve stem and that's easy access so you could use the flow-through or the cap here and then you've got your you're outside dual down here and again metal like see me grabbing that I mean it is very rigid and you could easily put a cap or a flow-through on that one as well so this is good news on this one again sometimes the class B's can give you a little problem with their rear duals and they won't always be that accessible and but there's always a solution for to get your sensors on your valve stems okay so this is a fifth wheel - triple axle this one's probably a 40-footer and so the first thing we want to do is we just want to look at the van stem and see is it metal or rubber and most of these bigger fifth wheels are going to have metal valve stands this one does again you can just grab it and just try and move it back and forth it's pretty clear that this is just a rigid valve stem so that means you can use the cap sensor or the flow-through sensor on this one and the only real consideration that you need to to take here I'll go ahead and take the cap off here the only real consideration is first of all the cap is going to be low profile and easy to put on there no concerns with the cap the only thing to consider with the flow-through is does the flow-through extend out past the the sidewall in this case it's that's borderline even if it does extend past the sidewall some people choose to use them anyway that doesn't bother them so if that doesn't bother you and you're like I've got the metal valve stems I want to use the flow-through then feel free to do so but I just wanted to point that out that it may be a consideration for some RV ears that are like hey if that's gonna stick out past my sidewall then I would just rather use the cap sensor so keep that in mind on these bigger 5th wheels that have the metal valve stems you can use the cap or the flu sensor ok so this is a bumper pull travel trailer and a lot of times these will have rubber valve stems so you'll need to use the cap sensors this one has what's considered a hybrid so if you'll notice it's actually if I take the valve stem off here it's actually metal here but it's got this rubber boot on it so we consider that a hybrid it's not full rubber it's not full metal so the trick here to determine if you can use a flow-through sensor on it that's only for a metal is to just grab it and wiggle it alright if you can move it like this then that needs to go ahead and have a cap sensor put on it there are hybrids on the market that you'll see that have the the rubber boot in the metal that are very stiff and if you grab it and it won't kind of like a metal valve stem then you're you're free to use the floater sensor with it but on this one right here I would definitely use the cap sensor because it's just not stable enough for a flow-through sensor so this is a maybe a 20 foot bumper pull travel trailer and this one has a rubber valve stem on it and you can see that it's rubber and of course if you grab it and move it you can see that it's very flexible just like a rubber valve stem so in this case you would want to use a camp sensor on there because you only want to use cap sensors on rubber valve stem so I hope this is helping you decide which sensor is correct for you again to make it simple on the flow-through sensor if you have a metal valve stem only on the floater sensor if you have a metal valve stem you can also use the cap sensor so that's really where the decision would come in if you've got a rubber valve stem that is your only choice right there keep in mind you can mix and match these so for example on my motorhome I used these flow-through sensors because I have metal valve stems and I've got plenty of room to put these and on my towed vehicle I use the cap sensor so you can mix and match them at the end of the day if you come down to where you have metal valve stems you can use either one you're kind of 50/50 on what to do oftentimes I'll tell people to just go with the cap sensor it's lower profile you really can't go wrong with those you know it's going to be able to fit anywhere so we hope that you'll go to techno RV comm and check out our tire pressure monitoring systems there certainly if you have any other questions you can call us chat with us email us and we've got a lot more

videos all right so here's the thing uh everybody is social distancing and we thought which makes you feel very alone well kind of accept that we're rvers so we're kind of used to it anyway but i had i do think that we have an advantage in this whole thing i've always said that rv we are used to being confined in in but oh yeah we're quarantined all the time anyway pretty much i mean and we're used to living with our spouses 24 7. there are some people yeah they got problems right so in a time of social distance uh we decided to actually bring you closer into our lives yeah so we thought we would do a 10 things that you didn't know about eric and tammy you probably couldn't care less about what these things are uh but we're going to share them anyway so a few obvious things that uh you may or may not know we do have three kids we have three adult kids three adult kids uh 26 25 and 21. two boys and a girl they're out doing their thing they're thinking they're out they're gone well they do think what we're doing is the coolest thing they do support us completely yeah they think this is cool and we are trying to inspire the next generation to uh i would like it if they would go do something brave yeah no rvn guardian that's nothing braver than that uh let's see our first jobs ever tammy what was your first job i mean outside of babysitting because everybody i first paid like w i had to fill out the form for everything i worked at a video store oh like like rentals or but not blockbuster like an off-brand eight-track stuff no no it was like the be like you go in and run a video oh okay and one of the perks is i got to like i'm too young to remember that uh we're gonna answer our ages next but anyway um and you the perk i liked most was you could take home any video at night if you worked the next day okay so i could watch all these movies for free okay all right pretty cool huh okay so that's nice so my first job never forget it actually oh never stop i work at a mexican restaurant called cucos i started as a dishwasher at the age of 16. we don't have long enough for your whole story so just come on okay anyway i immediately went to be a bus boy and then ended up in the kitchen y'all all he talks about he'll wake up in the morning and be like i dreamed i was cooking enchiladas i love that job i had so many great experiences there cucos you're running to me on the road i'll show you he will tell you the recipe of burrito any cuckoo's recipe he'll tell you all right so let's keep moving here uh we would both rather stay up late and sleep in that's for sure oh we are definite night owls and not morning people at all uh oh so we do both have uh phobias little things we're scared of but we're actually not gonna share them because like i would share mine there are things that like like like little animals or things and like i feel like if i let that out that like somebody as a joke will just come like throw it on me or something so it's a real phobia yeah it's one of those things it is something that lives outside though i'm just gonna say that all right so let's get into some really good stuff uh in mobile there is uh azaleas is the flower of it is the yes it is the flower ariel all right it's the most what's it called the city flowers the city maybe no the state's not so you may have seen it but they have something called an azalea trail made so i guess you're a senior in high school or something and you dress up in these big antebellum antebellum dresses and tammy was an azalea trailer so which was actually incredible because you get selected your senior year and the cool thing about it was i got to do the macy's day parade in new york i got to do the disney parade i went to six flags like we traveled all the time my senior year i got to do tons of stuff and you met 50 girls from the other hundred and something schools and mobile so it was it was an incredible sometimes tammy likes to put the dress on i couldn't fit in that dress if i tried are you kidding me it'd be a great social distancing outfit though yeah because the big hoops yes all right so i have seen these pictures i don't know if we can well i may can i don't know i'd have to look we'll see uh let's see what else you were in a band i played in a band eric had multiple personalities and he always has since we've been married he was i guess we were an hr director before that's what i did was my career that was your career and then he played in a band at night so it was like yeah hr by day exam and i would take my khakis off and put some cool blue jeans so i did that for like 10 years and the name of the band well the name of the band is fat lincoln because uh you know we had lincoln our english bulldog and we were sitting around uh with the guys thinking of a good name because i've been in a couple of bands before that and i was like i'm naming this one and this was going to be like straight up a rock and roll band and uh i definitely have pictures of this and i might have video and so uh anyway i was lincoln was laying on the floor and as y'all seen pictures of lincoln he's like a big fat bulldog and i was like fat lincoln that's the name and it's stuck actually it's stuck and it's still a it yeah like i left it to go travel and they they kept the band going so uh anyway that is that i was a guitar player you were guitar player you sang too a little bit all right so danced a little bit we had never rv before together yes we had rv before but not together when we got ever yeah that was not a that was not a thing like we didn't get married we didn't get like a pie this is what we got in common you know it was that that just kind of evolved um i had done like a pop-up camper little towables i traveled with family and airstream we had a little travel trailer when i was younger but yeah so uh but together we had never done that until we sold everything and hit the road five years ago uh let's see um oh we used to well i used to own a seafood place yeah technology is not the first business we owned yeah you owned a seafood business when we first met yes fresh market seafood oh yeah and in our first day stores alabama first date you took me to the seafood plate you did and you were like showing me the wine and you served me chowder and it was like i own this business hey if you've never picked up a woman with fish before you should try it you'd bring crab claws home at night of course simmer them up for me hey listen it was good stuff i had no other game other than seafood so that i did i did use that tomorrow and i had i was i was dating a girl that liked to eat so [Laughter] still likes to eat so that worked out good and speaking of that tammy loves kitchen gadgets to the point that it's a we have to leave some of them it's a vlog of mine i at one point had had a dehydrator because you know you got to make homemade jerky right uh full-on ice cream churn maker we have vitamix and sempot uh airfryer i have a kitchenaid mixer in the back of the closet you probably don't know about i have a fry daddy we have a coffee it's ridiculous i love kitchen gadgets like williamson oh just love them now tammy uh well people probably don't know this i bought this rv partly because the kitchen's so awesome yeah tammy like can really cook and she'll cook these elaborate things and then she'll she'll try and downplay it like oh that was super easy or anybody could do that but the truth of the matter is is like i know like she's got like super powers in this area so i had to level not that she would not that she would ask my permission anyway but if she did i would certainly that is my weakness uh give the permission to buy as many kitchen gadgets and i do i love that and you do use them i do use absolutely i do i don't know where this is headed other than we just wanted to share a little bit more about us well i mean like you stay put for a good three weeks you start kind of yeah people are sitting around looking for something to watch they might watch this and uh get to know us a little bit and get to know us a little bit more so uh we hope everybody's doing good hope we entertained you for a few minutes uh with this and we are ready to hit the road and we're ready for this thing to be lifted because the right time because i'm ready to get out of here but it's beautiful right now like mobile we're probably 80 degrees which sounds high but it's not like our shape like it's fabulous here with the weather right now but we have a good four weeks maybe oh yeah it's gonna start turning into the pits of like fire it's gonna be bad here so we've got to get out of here in the next month we don't play with mobile we don't burn you to the ground all right let's get out of here y'all have a good evening y'all have a good evening that was a banned send-off i've ever heard", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-04-09T17:22:05Z", "channelId":

{"id": "i2fL_fEAU2k", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "Funj13eWA47e5-6rwz5-p0N1BtU", "transcript": "hey this is Eric and Tammy from techno RV and what we thought we would do is shoot a short video here and show you where we are hunkered down as they say it in the South for the cove in crisis we had big plans this year and now we kind of don't so luckily we had put this RV pad up at the beginning of this year really well the end of last year beginning of this year right here behind our office so what we're looking at is the techno RV office slash warehouse and and then this is where we stay at nighttime of course as we are still full-time RVs just on our own RV pad so well you know what you may or may not know is our office is actually a house area that we've converted to an office so we also are looking at other houses around this and we'll show you that in just a second but yeah got finished converting and I guess early of last year still a lot of projects to do inside but it works well I think it's kind of cool this place was a dump when we got it it was we all the landscape and all the inside we pretty much interact with everything our pictures up yeah that would be entertaining and so so we made it not a dump right no we really do have a nice place for our people to work we do have three employees and they're gone for the day so we thought while they're gone let's go in there have a look around right alright so this is the techno RV office from the front and you can probably still see the RV in the back there where we just did the intro and so anyway we got this big nice oak tree here and a little history lesson about this place is that house right next door there we actually raised our kids in that house yeah we got married in that house and we sold it a lot of years ago so we kind of know the people in the area and so it's really worked out us being here so anyway let's go inside so we just lay down the concrete here and we made it super wide here we get about we get at least four pickups a day and some of the trucks are kind of big and so we want to make sure they had a nice big 12-foot wide driveway to come in and give them some places to turn around at and sometimes we have our veers that will come by even though we're not a storefront if somebody wants to come by and say hey then they're welcome to do that so we laid a nice sidewalk here and and you walk around to the front of the house we just painted the house I mean pretty much everything's been redone like all the landscaping and it just the house just looks completely different now but this is the front door to techno RV welcome to techno RV and it may okay so when you come in to techno RV if you take a right you were in Evans office if you've ever called in and talked to Evan this is her domain right here she's she loves the double screens and she can I got her phone where she takes her phone calls for support and sales mom three boys bless her she's actually working from home right now because of the Kovan child care stuff we cancel schools in the oh yeah she's got super cute kids and so she's got all her racks over here that she does testing and things on so she's really got a nice set up in here and if you've ever called in to techno RV and talked to Allison then this is Allison's space here and Allison also helps with support and sales and she also does some bookkeeping for us and also some warehouse work we've never lit the fireplace up I guess there are working hours that might be pretty cool awkward but of course got the Alabama wreath up here and so that will probably remain for a long time to taunt during the Iron Bowl okay so as we start kind of moving through we start we start getting into like some inventory here this area was never really meant to be for inventory out here it was I was all supposed to be housing to here but shortly after we moved into here we kind of started over outgrowing this space so inventory moved into this space because we got our trucker side - so we got trucker GPS a lot of the TST the tire pressure monitoring and the trucking tire pressure monitoring surge guard I know well you're sitting I did have a sitting room but that lasted for about a week so in here is the rest of the inventory and where all the packing is done this is the what we call our warehouse packing area and yeah so if you've ordered from us and you've gotten like like we get compliments about how things are nicely packed that's all cha-cha and Alison and so anyway this is where we pack things here and it's really an efficient place because everything's kind of right here so they can go and pick and grab and then through this door here is where this is a pickup room so this each one of these racks represents a different carrier and so they the carrier's actually have a code of security code to the door here so even if they don't come before our hours end at the end of the day they can still come in here and get that I think this was probably one of the best decisions we made because it allows us to yeah them having access we don't have to interact it's been great with the whole virus stay away from everybody things yes this room ended up being really good yeah the the carrier's like it can hold outdoor good job it used to be a garage yeah yeah so the entire places is is is locked up like Fort Knox its sweep we installed you can't walk five feet in here with that different camera systems so we got all the cameras and all the all the cool uh alarm technology so yeah it's monitored we're on the road which is super nice as well we can all see what's going on so there's yeah you got to do those things sometimes when you're not here yeah absolutely so all right so we did support and sales warehouse you got to have a break room right yeah so this house you know just had a kitchen and and who wouldn't want to work somewhere that supplies a massage chair and with chocolates and a candle and and that's actually from the RV oh the the the cherry yeah yeah we pulled that out of the RV so some more inventory in here really little burr keys we need to hopefully get more burr keys in soon but anyway little sitting area here and you know yeah the kitchen we pretty much left it pretty close we came in a little bit just because it was very outdated but you know it's a break room it's not a kitchen we don't have really appliances or anything got a Berkey got a bar key absolutely and it serves them well they're able to bring their lunch and make breakfasts and do whatever they need to do yeah and they can spy on us out the window there's our RV right all right so this the whole house is just kind of like a big circle here so sometimes we have additional supplies and inventory here and then we do have a conference room here that when when we're in town we'll have like suppliers come in I know Garmin visit us not too long ago TST so if we need a place to have a meeting this is it and we used to work from here December but now that the RV so close which is worth narvi hey can I do usually yeah we do we have an appropriate rug here for the conference room a bathroom with a shower by the way I mean I mean I need a shower after lunch yeah I mean who doesn't want to take a few support call and come take a shower right and then you're kind of right back here in the front so let's let's go look at the art light let's just go out back so we'll just circle back through and so you see if it's just a big circle and then so this is the back door of the office and if you go out here you've got a big patio area here it kind of looks like a big basketball court here that guy should put a basketball Zola look Allison and Evan would like that play a little one-on-one you hurt yourself yeah so and then there is the RV back over here yeah so we pretty much get the backyard ish yeah all the landscaping Tammy's mother loves landscaping she loves being outside with the flowers and all that so really a lot of like a lot of the bushes and all the a lot of a backyard look pretty for us and you know it looks really it's colorful it's almost all of it that she did we got a plane coming over here so well let's just get some video while the planes coming over so we made the turn really super wide so any size RV could get in we had friends or something or we got a lot of people that have RVs that we know then we were out of town they wanted to stay here then any sized RV can fit here really pleased with how the pad worked out with the you know kind of the sitting area oh you know bring the smoker with me on the road tow in the Jeep and so I pull it out here and Tammy has excursion now we have a garden but yes it was my thing yeah Tammy's got a little herb garden here oh I love that and then around the back side of the RV here Eric dug me some holes we actually tilled it didn't you yeah yeah we did we have a garden Tammy got all excited I just put the whole Copiah thing I don't know like it's gonna run out or something a garden when we had a house and I enjoyed watching things grow so I just wanted to do that so what we got here we have the back rows mainly Tomatoes different types and then we have cucumbers in zucchini and we have a lot of different peppers from green and red and jalapeno and Tabasco and I don't think I did have an error maybe I did I personally think we'll be on the road before before all this really produces although the lettuce we did eat from that last night we did they were on our hammer but all this stuff I'm thinking we're gonna be on the road alright here's my fault really here's the full hookup so we said it I mean it's basically like being at the campground right so I've got 50 and 30 amp hookup here full Water and Sewer and we basically just tied everything into the house system appropriately fully inspected and and then we have a little shed back here which actually when we got the place it was so covered up with bushes and you couldn't even see it you couldn't you it you you couldn't even see it we assumed we were gonna tear it down when we found it cuz we were like oh this has got to be gross and rotten because it's been behind trees but remarkably it was well made in the beginning and so we're still working on it we got to replace the the ten on the roof but anyway it's turn turned out to be kind of nice to kind of put a few things in and that is the techno RV office and the techno RV RV pad and we're very thankful yes we're very thankful for to to be able to have this to come back to any time but really especially now [Music]", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-04-09T00:17:55Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "TechnoRV Office

with your weboost drive ex RV when you order it from techno RV so this is a cellular booster that I use personally while out on the road and I get great results boosting my cellular networks it works with all cellular carriers and this is the box that you will get and this is the box within the box that has all of your components in it and this is what I want to spend a little bit of time talking about so that you know what you're getting here so let's go ahead and open this thing up and one thing I want to point out is that weboost has always done a great job with labeling step by step type instructions like right when you open the box the first thing I see is steps one and two and I know that I'm going to grab a particular component step three so forth and so on so I love that about this but up here on the top of your box here you're gonna have a little list of what's inside the box so you're gonna need to spend a little time to make sure you got everything you're supposed to get but I'm gonna walk you through that right now so maybe the first thing you notice here is that you get your your user's manual here so you need to go through that and make sure that you understand everything this is also a card here on how to register your weboost so you need to make sure that you do that as well and also keep in mind that you get this user manuals but whenever you purchase your unit from techno RV you get the technology learning series and we've got an installation video and we've also got a document with frequently asked questions that kind of everything you need to know about about your kit here and installing it so let's just go through the box here I'm just going to go through the steps here on step one and two you've got your outside antenna this is the OTR antenna that you get with this kit very rugged fine with all all kinds of weather there's nothing going to be any problems there but this is designed for for the abuse of of outside and it is arguably the best antenna that weboost offers that's the OTR antenna it comes with this kit so it comes with a little pigtail coax cable here and then you're going to get more cable to go along with that in addition up underneath this outside antenna you've got some extenders here that you can add to the length of the outside antenna so that you can get more height on this antenna if you would like to do that if you don't want to use the extenders you don't have to but they are available for you if you would like to use them so that is your antenna scenario there you're also going to get 25 feet of coax cable so this is the cable that's going to run from your outside antenna inside your RV to connect to the amplifier so you've got your 25 feet of coax cable there you're also going to have some little cable mounts and basically what this is is this is just going to help you to kind of clean your install up a little bit so as you're running cable maybe across the roof of your RV or something like that these will help you secure them and that kind of makes it nice and that is all included in the kit also you're going to get the the ladder mount bracket so this allows you to mount this vertically or horizontally on a ladder rack or maybe you have some other way that you would like to mount this and then this mount might be of use to you to do that so whenever you go to install this unit it's really every RV is a little different and we explained this in our installation video so I won't get too deep into it but you will be figuring out what is the best way to enter the cable into your RV and that could be any number of things from drilling a hole or coming in through some kind of vent if you choose to drill a hole this unit actually comes with a bit that is the right size hole that you would need to drill into your RV so it comes with that and so that is nice to have there so let's keep moving through things here with the mount you're going to get it includes a spring mount so this is going to be nice because let's say you're driving down the road and maybe a tree branch catches your outside antenna the spring mount is going to allow a little bit of give in that so that may help you in those type of situations making our way through the kit here we've got the cable entry cover here and what this is is if you choose to drill a hole in your RV to get the cable in then they actually give you a cable entry cover which is pretty nice so you can install this and it'll help you to make sure that it's easier to make it weatherproof by having a cable entry cover and that is included in the kit so let's get to the main engine of this thing and that is the drive x RV amplifier here and 50 DB gain power and it is the most allowed power by the FCC of a vehicle in motion and weboost has got it with their drive x amplifier this is the engine that kind of makes everything happen and you're also going to get a bracket that this will fit into so you could mount this bracket inside and then just snap this into it so all that comes with it your power supplies for your amplifier here you get two power supplies one of them is a standard AC outlet like just a wall plug that you plug into the wall plug into that drive x RV amplifier and you're going to get power the other thing that you get with this is a DC power supply and I'm gonna go ahead and take this out of the bag here because I want to show you this it's a DC power supply but it comes with two open lead in so it doesn't have like a a cigarette lighter style plug on the end although you could install something like that on here if you wanted to but it is designed to be connected directly into a 12-volt source within your RV so you get both of those options the AC and DC power supply with your drive x RV unit here the last thing that we need to talk about here is your inside antenna here and this is the antenna that is going to sit inside of your RV and it is going to rebroadcast the boosted signal within your RV so it's a nice-looking little unit you can set it on a desk maybe in your common area and then the cable that comes with it will go and attach to the drive X amplifier so that is everything that comes in this unit and now I just want to briefly give you an overview of once this is all put together how these units work so now that you know everything that comes in the drive x RV kit by weboost want to explain just a little bit about how a cellular booster works and what's going to happen here is you're gonna have this outside antenna obviously mounted outside and it's going to pull in the weak signal the local cell tower it'll pull that weak signal in and it'll bring it inside to where your amplifier is your amplifier will be inside of your RV this amplifier is then going to boost that weak signal once it boosts the signal it's going to run that boosted signal back out into your RV through that little desk top inside antenna it's going to create a boosted zone within your RV so it'll boost a zone up to ten feet the size of the boosted zone that you can expect to get is really dependent on what that originating signal was in the first place so if you think kind of like speaking through a megaphone if you whisper through it you're not getting much projection but the louder you begin to speak through it the more projection you get out of that and that's kind of the same scenario that you are going to get with the inside antenna so you'll definitely get that boosted zone there to boost for both cellular data and cellular voice as well so it does both of those so that's just a brief explanation of what these cell boosters do and what all you get in this kit it's a great kit I use it full time on the road you can get the drive xrv at techno RV comm when you order from techno RV comm you also get that learning series to make sure that your install is successful hey if you're looking for more information about cellular boosting

to talk to you today about propane safety the technology that currently exists on your system to protect you from propane leaks and then I also want to talk to you about a device that you can add to your system that will make sure that you have 100% automatic shutoff in case you have a leak because current technology does not do that and let me explain so on propane tanks you have this valve here that is called a overflow protection device or OPD valve and they started putting these on propane tanks right around 1998 and the reason they did this is because back in the day before that time you could open up the valve and it would just free flow propane so that's obviously not good the devices today I can just turn this on and nothing is going to come out of this OPD valve and so that was a good thing for the industry that they added it's a good thing for the propane in your RV to have these valves so what happens is is let's say that this is your propane line from your RV that we're now going to connect to the OPD valve so now obviously once I connect this the OPD valve safety device will just open up and it will free flow so what exists after this point from a safety measure is that there's an excess flow valve in your propane line it's it's basically in this in this brass piece right here it's kind of a spring-loaded device there that if you have a certain level of a leak it will shut off about 80% of that leak but that other 20% will continue to flow so if you had a cut line or any kind of leak of propane while this is good to have and you do have it it does not 100 shut off the propane and I want to demonstrate it so OPD Vail I'm now attaching my RVs propane line to this propane tank this propane tank is filled with air just so you know I'm not filling the room with with propane here so now I'm just going to shut off the end of the line here with my thumb and I'm gonna go ahead and turn the propane on now I felt the pressure come to my thumb and it's ready to go here the line is pressurized with in this case air now if I had a leak in this system then that's what's going to be coming into your RV again it is not a 100% shutoff and you can probably hear I'll just put this up to my mic so that you can hear that is a pretty good bit of air in this case coming out of this device so again a lot of people think that they have some kind of device in their RV that if they have a leak that it's somehow going to cut it off and the truth the matter is is that you don't so what I want to talk about is a device that we have a techno RV it's called gas stop and this is a 100% shut off device if you have an excess flow of propane over what would be considered just normal usage in your RV this is going to cut you off from it and so I want to demonstrate it for you here first of all it's super easy to use it's got a gauge built into it so that you can see how much propane is in your tank here and the way this works is that there is a calibrated ball bearing in this unit and if it detects an excess flow of propane then it seats that ball up against an o-ring and completely shuts off the propane into your RV so the way you would install this is simple now you're just going to connect the gas stop device on to the propane tank just like this and then you're going to connect your RV side to the gas top device and we will just go ahead and connect that here so installation is easy literally that's it from a physical standpoint of what you would need to do to install this unit we just did it now again I'm going to close off the line here that would normally be going into your RV to pressurize the system now I'm going to turn the propane on and when you turn the propane on you need to prime the gas stop by pressing down on the gauge four or five times and as soon as I do that I feel the line is now pressurized and I've got about a half full tank here based on the gauge so if I were to have an excess flow over normal operation of propane this device is going to recognize it and it's going to shut it off immediately so as soon as I let my thumb off of the end of the hose here the gas stop is going to jump into action and shut this off just like that so now there's no air coming out of this line at all and again that was accomplished by that calibrated ball bearing being seated up against that o ring in here because it detected excess flow so that that excess propane that we heard earlier coming out because we were mimicking a leak with the gas stop system you're not going to get that it is 100% shut off the gas stop device comes in in two types and it's basically depends on what your connection point at your propane tank is this is considered like an acme style connection and then there's one that's called a pol connection on our website techno RV comm we've got a little chart to make sure that you get the right one if you have two propane tanks then you need to get two devices and that is the only device on the market that will guarantee 100 percent shutoff of propane should you have a propane leak in your RV and it's called gas stop you can get it at techno RV dot-com", "snippet": {"publishedAt":

GasStop is a high-quality device that is attached between the OPD valve and the RV regulator.

{"id": "jTkd_nMW-sw", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "uyrYzV310D_fm-Jx_KVrKIQjdV0", "transcript": "hey this is Eric over at techno RV and in this learning series video I'm going to show you how to replace your old style twistlock plug with your new smart plug so the tools that you'll need to complete this install is you will need a Phillips head screwdriver you will need a pair of cable cutters and it be nice to have some wire strippers for this job some scissors and a tape measure or a ruler of some sort believe it or not you're going to need to use some like dishwashing soap and then everything else you need for this job is in the smart plug kit so this is what comes in your kit you have a weatherproof sleeve seal you have a cord sort of install tool here that we'll get to you've got some screws and a allen wrench here you've got the inlet that we'll be installing and then you have your plug head that we'll be installing as well today I'm going to start with the inlet here and the first thing that I'm going to want to do is on the back of this there is a strain relief and I'm just going to take that strain relief off and you will need to do the same thing here before we move this project over to the RV so it's a Philips head screw and this should come out easily there we go I don't know if I'll need this strain relief until I open up the inlet on this class-c to kind of see where the cable is routed in the RV if the cable kind of takes a ninety degree dive then maybe you're going to need the strain relief but if it doesn't then you probably don't so let's go ahead and install the inlet so this is the inlet that we will be replacing here and you'll have four here and we just need to take these out and go ahead and take the existing inlet off of this RV this is the easy stuff once we take these screws out the inlet should just come out I'll save these screws because I'm probably going to use these the smart plug does come with its own set of screws but I may use these existing screws so I'm gonna put these here so I don't lose them this is where things can be a little bit different is what the backside of this plug looks like I mean ultimately what we're doing here is we're going to be disconnecting the wiring on the backside of the of the inlet and so this can look a little bit different depending on the setup and this one looks like it's got a little twist bracket there and then I'm not mistaken here okay so it had like a twist cap on it and then just did like a quarter turn on this and the whole back this comes off so nothing to that and then you're going to have your wiring going into the back of the inlet and luckily it's Phillips head as well so I'm just going to loosen these so that I can take the wiring out again yours may be a little bit different than this but it should be something that is relatively easy to do once you loosen those it just comes out like that and the inlet is officially uninstalled and then the rest of this just slides over the cabling and it leaves you with just your wiring and the first thing you want to do is you want to inspect the wiring to make sure you don't have any corrosion in this case this RV is is basically new within you know the last three four months the wiring looks great if it didn't look great then you're gonna need to strip that back some more and find you some nice shiny brass there and but I don't have to do that so we look good right here and this is ready for the new smart plugin so this is a smart plug Inlet the screw pattern is pretty typical with these and but there may be some rare cases where they may not line up but in most cases they do if you wanted to check you could take this little weather strip piece off here and you could just line it up with the screw holes to see hey is this going to line up and in this case of course it does and so we are ready to install the inlet here and what we're looking to do here these are color-coded here on the back you can see you've got your course you've got your ground your neutral and your hot wire and so this ring here is black so of course I'm going to put the black one there and then the white one right here is going to go here and then of course your ground is going to go in where the green is on the back of the smart plug this is just a matter of lining these up the side posts here this kit comes with an allen key here so I'm just going to screw those out a bit and get them ready for the cable to go in and this is where you got to have a little patience to get the wires lined up here and again I'm gonna have to turn this a bit and again the ground it's gonna go in the green I'm neutral and the white and then the black is my hot line here so now that the wiring is lined up into the appropriate color-coded pattern here on the back of the inlet we're just going to start tightening these up and you really want to get a good bite on these and if you do these one at a time and make sure that each lawn has a good bite and that's going to save you the hassle of them popping out on you when you move to the next one don't ask me how I know that okay those are in there good and tight now it is a matter sorry about taking the view here getting my ground wire good and tight there all right double-check and make sure that you have a tight connection to these wires and you shouldn't have any movement in there and I don't so this is ready to be pushed back into the RV so that we can just screw this on to the outside of the RV I didn't want to go back and talk about the strain relief here a little bit if you've got a scenario where your electrical wires once they enter the RV or having to make some sharp turns maybe there's a wall just a few inches in and the the wirings really having to cut the strain relief is often good for that and because in essence what will happen here is instead of this cable just kind of coming straight back the strain relief would be screwed back on to the back of the inlet and the electrical wiring would actually come out of the sides here of the strain relief and hold them in place in this case we don't need it okay it's time to go ahead and put the inlet into the RV here so basically I'm just going to push it and do my best to line the holes up here of course you got this weather stripping on the back and it can make it a little interesting on identifying exactly where we are at I am going to use the screws that came with the RV on the previous Inlet that we had and from here again patience is a something you need to bring to the job here because we're going to have to find first hole here and once I find it then I want to go ahead and line the other ones up I don't want to just crank this one down tight and I think I'm going to try and take a peek behind here and get it through the there we go okay doing good there see if I can do that this upper side here and actually leaving this hanging out a little bit is helping me kind of look behind it line some of this stuff up get the screw through the weather stripping on the back okay got two of them biting there and go ahead and give it a good push there because again you don't want to install like the lower side in without having the upper side already in place because that will be an instant problem for you and that's why I like to keep pushing it in as I go we're doing good here we just got one more screw and that lined up so now is always a good time to really push it up against the RV and see what we're gonna have here my weather stripping is in place I don't see any issues here with just going ahead and starting to work these in so we'll get this one going needs to be snug but you don't want to crank down too hard because again this is going into your RV here you don't want to strip that whole out so you'll have to kind of gauge that but where I sit and looking at the weather stripping on the back that looks great so this is installed now what we need to do is go replace that plug head on the electrical cable and we'll be done with this install all right it's time to get rid of this twist plug here and I know you're excited about that so let's go ahead and get started I've got my cable cutters here and we're just going to clip the plug head right off of it all right so let's go ahead and just cut right through the cable here and having the right tool for the job makes that really easy and this is what you're left with here and this is where we will install our smart plug head now what I'm going to do from here is we're going to need to strip back an inch and a quarter of this shielding right here and so let's go ahead and do that and so I mentioned earlier that you need a tape measure and it's really important that you get this isn't the inch and a quarter you'll find out is an important number once we start stripping other things back so you really want to measure this out and by the way did I mention you're going to need a knife for this job so here is an inch and a quarter right here and I'm just going to go ahead and mark that with the knife here and now I'm just going to strip the inch and a quarter off of here and you want to make sure that when you're doing this that you are not going into the shielding so deep that you start cutting into the shielding from the wiring on inside of this you really just want to get this started and again the goal here is you do not under any circumstances want to go so deep that you get into the cabling and this should pull right off here and then you've got all of this sort of insulation here and go ahead and just kind of inspect the wiring and make sure that you did not cut into it which we did not and then you're just going to use the scissors to snip away all of this excess shielding here kind of making a mess here but it's got to go there we go all right now what we are going to need to do is a strip back these three wires here a half an inch all right so we're looking for a half inch here so I'm just going to kind of look at one to kind of get an idea visually of what I'm looking at and because I want I want that to be right and I've got some wire strippers here so this will make the job easier and again you don't want to cut into that inside wiring so just take your time just kind of go around it till you're through that shielding even try to pull it off or maybe it's time just to make sure you don't cut into the wiring and and there it goes and we're just going to do that to all three wires then we'll be ready to install plug it and one left to go half an inch there we go all right we've got all of our wires pulled here and now it is time to install the plug head alright so we got a half an inch of the wire strip back which leaves us about three quarters of an inch down to the exterior exterior shielding here so I'm going to set this aside and we're going to pull in our plug head here and what you're going to need to do is go ahead and press in on both sides here and then this will just come out just like that and then we're going to take our weatherproof cord seal here and this is going to need to go and inside of the hole on this end and you basically just push it in there and then kind of inspect it from the other side until you'll see that it is in there nice and tight alright in the next step we're going to need to get this cable through the weather boot here that we have on the back of the plug head and the kit comes with this installer tool here which you will definitely need to get this through that small hole now in the instructions it talks about that you need to lubricate the cable here so that it will go through this easier and so I have some dishwashing liquid here that I'm going to put on the cable and on the Installer up here and then I've also got just some water soapy solution here that I'm going to use as well so let's go ahead and get this process started here okay we're going to put dishwashing soap on about a foot of this here because once we pull this through you're going to pull it through about seven or eight inches through the plug head so this part of the process gets a little sloppy and but it is part of the process and I it's a good idea to have like a dishrag with you to kind of wipe your hands off with here because you're gonna need to get some leverage on this and then again I've got this soapy water here and I'm just going to go ahead and spray that on here as well and then I'm gonna spray some here and then we are going to take the Installer and push it right through this hole here you know this is where you could take some soap spray some more soap on it because again I need to get this cable about eight inches through there and you'll see that that soapy water like I don't see a lot of people do that but trust me the soapy water is the key if you'll first put some dishwashing detergent on it and then spray the soapy water it really is not a big deal it goes right in so now we can just remove the Installer and move on to the next step nothing to it alright it's time to install the plug head so let's go ahead and bring that in and again color-coordinated you got green white and black and we got a green white and black cable here and on the instructions it does kind of say it might be easier to kind of bend these to where they they line up so I'm going to kind of do that but I'm really going to go in to this one cable at a time and I'll go ahead and start here with the black cable and make sure because once I have that in then the other ones I can move it around pretty easily once I have one end and then you take that same allen key that we used earlier and you want to go ahead and and uh and tighten that up here now a little circle back around to the green wire let's go ahead and get that in we had tighten that a bit and then it is just a white wire and I'm gonna have to reinsert the black wire but that's okay because I did not tighten it down enough so remember that when you're doing your install okay and then you'll see that black wire kind of jumped out on me there and that's okay I'll just come back around and and back out that screw a little bit sorry about this when we get it right though good good good good that's in and we'll tighten that down excellent okay I'm going to go around and give all of these an extra little turn to make sure they're good and tight but that is what you are looking for when you are done as those wires nicely seated in there and your Allen screws nice and tight around those wires so one thing I want to re-emphasize before we move on is take whatever time you need to make sure that the wiring is installed really well and tightened down so that they are not going to come loose and this one is just fine the other next step is to install the strain relief here and remember when I told you that it was important that you make sure that your cuts are measured because at the end of the day you want to make sure that the strain relief wraps around the shielding of the cable so you've got a couple of screws that come with the kit here and we're just going to install these and this will keep fine wiring job that you did from coming out take any pressure off of the wiring in the back of the plug head so get those lined up and then just start inching these down kind of together okay so something I actually should have done a little earlier is taking just this gasket off of the plug because that'll expose the screw slots here whenever we push this back in and tighten it to it so the back of this gasket has some 3m tape tape on it and one of the last steps is we'll reinstall that back but now you'll see that it's exposed the where we're going to put the three screws at so the next step here is is to just pull this back through this plug head right here alright from here it's just time to move the plug head here up into the housing so you'll want to make sure you've got one screw hole on one side of this and two screw holes on another so make sure you've got that lined up with where the the screw holes are in the housing and I need to twist mine just a little bit here and and because we've been working on this for a bit it's the cables kind of dried up and so I'm gonna use just a little bit of soapy water here not a whole lot but just right there to get it started on the cable and then I like to use like a towel just to get a grip right the plug head is installed you've got three screws that need to secure the plug head into the housing and so let's go ahead and get those in here again Phillips head screwdriver is the tool you'll need go ahead and get all three of them started here there we go to going number three all right and then we'll just go around and just keep going around until they're all starting to bite and then again I want to over-tighten but it does need to be tight we're almost done here with this project okay screws are installed and the final step here is to reinstall the gasket here and again it is got the sticky back on it so we're just going to go ahead and take that off and then place that here line it up and then you can take just a your Phillips head screwdriver and just start going around and around till that seats in there perfect that is the completed product and I'm excited to go plug this into the RV alright it's the final install here we've got the plug head on the inlet is installed and you remember how clunky the process used to be to plug your electrical cord in with that twist on plug head that you used to have no more this is the smart plug head going into the smart plug Inlet and it is just that easy and I don't want to make any assumptions at what's on the other end of your power cable but you need to make sure that you've got a surge guard total electrical protection system like this one here this one is designed for 30 amp RVs it's the 34 930 the newest model is the 34 931 and 450 amp models you want to be looking for the 34 951 we've got lots of videos on the techno RV YouTube channel to describe in detail what these

{"id": "Ft2bICmIQ_c", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "_qtjkZ8iL9VhGr592w2IB8QQ_J8", "transcript": "hey this is Eric over at techno RV and in this video I'm going to talk to you about the advantages of the smart plug connector and Inlet electrical plug versus the typical twist slot style plug that we have on this RV right here so let's start with the typical twist lock style electrical cord and Inlet that you see right here and you'll see this on most RVs and this design has been around for a long time but it has some design flaws that I want to talk to you about so I'm gonna go ahead and take this plug off of this class seat here and the first thing that I want to talk to you about is the curved shape electrical pins that you have on the inlet side the curved shape electrical pins means minimal surface contact from the plug to the inlet and whenever you have minimal surface contact that means that the electrical transfer is not going to be as efficient and it's going to generate more heat another design flaw with these twist slot plugs is the locking ring they are often prone to cracking and even stripping out and when that occurs what you have is your plug will begin to put a strain on the electrical pins in the inlet and that will make those electrical pins prone to breaking off and at minimum you will have less contact electrical surface area and that means that the heat will be driven up on the plug another typical issue that you have with these twists lock style plugs is that it's generally not a tight fit there's usually a gap that exists between the plug head and the inlet and that gap can create stress on the electrical pins and it can also affect the contact surface again driving up the heat on the plug there's also some just usability issues that if you talk to enough our veers that use this style plug you'll hear about it and that is just making sure that this plug is installed properly because of the twist pens it's not a given that you are plugging in correctly and making good contact between the plug head and the electrical pins so I'm going to go ahead and do this and kind of show you here the first thing that of course you need to do is line up the curved pins like that and then the idea is that you would then twist down now I'm already running to do into an issue not sure connected properly and now I down okay so I feel like I'm on there now and then of course now I got a deal with the locking ring and already cross-threaded and I got it that time and that should be installed properly but from a usability standpoint can be quite frustrating whenever you show up at your RV site and trying to get the twistlock plug installed properly and then of course if you start having stripping of the threads from the locking ring then that can create issues as well on this particular twist lock plug right here it's kind of got this 90-degree turn right here which actually kind of like that on this a lot of them will just come straight out and it seems like that even creates more stress on the electrical pins on this one now that it's installed now that I'm looking at it this 90 degree turn it's really not it just doesn't look like it's straight so what that tells me is I'm not a hundred percent sure that I've got the twist on the plug done correctly maybe I do it kind of feels like I do but these are the kind of problems that you have it's like you can install this or plug in whenever you get to an RV park and you're kind of left with thinking is that properly installed or not so now that we've talked about the typical twist style electrical plug we're going to I'm going to go ahead and install the smart plug connector and inlet on to this Class C RV and so when we come back this will be installed and then we'll talk about the advantages of the smart plug head and Inlet over the typical twist outlook and when you get your smart plug from techno RV we do have a install video that will send to you to make sure that you're successful installing your smart plug we've got the smart plug installed on this class female and so the install video that we did for this you will get when you purchase your smart plug from techno RV will just send that to you so let's go ahead and just talk about what you're getting here first of all you remember the process of just plugging in the twist lock style plug and how kind of clunky that was those days are going with the smart plug because all you do is just plug it in when you plug it in these two clamps pop out to lock it into place then you just pop the top down on it and literally that's it so anybody that's been out there messing with one of these twist rings and the twist tight plug wondering if you got a solid connection those days are over also you remember we talked about the surface space of those curved pins well the smart plug doesn't have curved spins pins they use nickel-plated brass a high-quality nickel-plated brass and you are going to get great connectivity it's going to reduce the heat on your plug because there's 20 times more surface area from the electrical pins to your plug head and that again that extra surface area is going to make for great electrical transfer from the power pedestal into your RV and again the install from this point pop it in close it smart plug you can get it at techno RV comm and I don't want to make any assumptions at what's on the other end of your power cable but you need to make sure that you've got a surge guard total electrical protection system like this one here this one's designed for 30 amp RVs it's the 34 930 the newest model is the 34 931 and for 50 amp models you want to be looking for the 34 951 we've got lots of videos on the techno RV YouTube channel to describe in detail what these units will do for you and go over there now and check it out", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2019-08-19T19:37:16Z", "channelId":

{"id": "xeFzuhHW8bI", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "42148w98k0hlVJbWyDZJswTKvjA", "transcript": "hey this is Eric from techno RV and in this information video I'm going to compare and tell you everything that you need to know about the TST tire pressure monitoring system cap sensors versus the flow through sensors and I hope by the end of this video this will help you in your decision making process on which sensor may be best for you and as always you can get all of your TST tire pressure monitoring system kits and accessories at techno RV com these are the two different types of sensors that TST offers this sensor here is a flow-through sensor and this simply means that you can air up your tire through the sensor without taking it off of the valve stem this is the cap sensor and it is much lower profile than the the flow-through sensor but you do need to take it off of the valve stem in order to air it up so let's compare these two sensors let's start with the measurements the cap sensor measures from bottom to top the height of it at point nine of an inch the diameter from one side all the way to the other is also about point nine of an inch the flow-through sensor is 2.2 inches long to one inch wide and 0.9 inches high from here to so that is the measurements of these two systems here the weight of them the flow-through sensor weighs about 22 grams and the cap sensor weighs about 18 grams so both less than an ounce and you do not need to rebalance your tires with either one of these they just don't weigh enough the PSI ratings for both of these sensors is from 0 to 218 psi with an accuracy of plus or minus 3 psi the operating temperature for both of these sensors is from negative 40 to 176 degrees Fahrenheit with an accuracy of plus or minus 3 degrees both of these sensors are pressure activated what this means is is that when you put these sensors on to the valve stem and turn your TST monitor on it will start broadcasting forward the pressure and temperature of each tire this is opposed to other systems that may be motion activated that means you have to start rolling before they start broadcasting information that's not as good as pressure activated because with the pressure activated sensors of the TST you're going to be able to get your pressures before you start on your trip I think that's a very important point pressure activated both of these sensors have user replaceable batteries in them the cap sensor has a 2032 battery and the flow-through sensor has a 1632 battery both of these type batteries are easy to find and you can expect about one year of battery life out of these sensors and then you just change them out yourself it's very easy to do and then you're good for another year both of these sensors have anti-theft features and they they work kind of the same way with each sensor that you get you will also get a brass nut with each sensor and what you'll do is you'll put this brass nut onto the valve stem first and then whichever type sensor that you have you'll then screw that sensor on to the valve stem and then you'll have a tool that will allow you to back that nut back against the sensor thus locking it onto the valve stem it's really easy to do and it's very effective you don't have to use the anti-theft locking nut if you don't want to the sensors will stay on the valve stems just fine without it but if you want the anti-theft feature then it certainly comes with it and you can can certainly use that these sensors as far as what types of valve stems these sensors will work with the cap sensor will work on metal or rubber valve stems the cap sensor will work on either the flow-through sensor needs to be on a metal valve stem so you do not want to put the flow-through sensor onto a rubber valve stem the reason there is just the extra length on the flow-through sensor creates more centrifugal force and over time it could wear down a rubber valve stem so again flow through sensors only on metal valve stems cap sensors you can put on either metal or rubber so there you have it kind of everything you need to know about both of these sensors and the comparison of them and you can just give this video a thumbs up and if you have additional questions then please post them in the comments and we will be sure to answer those questions for you so now that you have all the information about these two type sensors if you still have some questions about how to make that decision I've made another video where I really just talk about the questions you

{"id": "3335kUMln6Y", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "-s8udUW0BZ95ri4b4b24U91dfGE", "transcript": "hey this is Eric at techno RV and today I'm going to tell you everything that you need to know about the surge guard 34 931 total electrical protection system for 30 amp RVs so let's jump right into it so what one of these units does is that you're going to plug this unit into the power pedestal and then you're going to plug your RV into the receptacle at the base of this unit so all Power has to go through the system when you turn the breaker on on the pedestal then this unit is going to run a 10 second analysis on the pedestal during that 10 seconds it's going to make sure that you've got a proper ground a proper neutral that you don't have any polarity type issues it's also going to make sure that you don't have any high low voltage issues at the time and it's also going to test for frequency as well so once it crosses the power over to your RV assuming everything's ok then it's going to continue to protect you from high and low voltage so anything below 102 volts above 132 volts that would be considered power that's not safe for the electronic components in your RV so if the voltage levels were to get outside of that range this unit would protect you from that and cut you off from that if it cuts you off then it'll run another analysis and then whenever you come back to within spec it will cut the power back on for you it's also got great surge suppression it gives you two thousand four hundred and fifty joules of of power surge protection and that's a lot for a 30 amp unit and this unit will give that to you so this unit also does something that no other 30 amp unit on the market will do and what that is is everything we've been talking about is on the line side of things like from the pedestal power coming from the pedal so that's what we call line side load side is the RV and what this unit can do is it can actually detect elevated ground currents inside of your RV so your shouldn't have a lot of current on that on that ground line and if you do if it gets to about 30 volts then this unit is going to detect that there's a problem there and it'll it'll cut you off from that so that's that load side protection that this unit offers and it's you really need that in in your RV if you're going to get one of these total electrical protection systems so these are also weather resistant so as long as this just didn't like sitting in a puddle of water like that would not be good but other than that rain snow sleet high winds whatever it is going to be just fine it's also got this nice locking ring on it and so what this is for is this allows you to lock this unit to the power pedestal to keep those would-be thieves away so you would just get a cable lock or a chain and lock and you would just attach it to this locking ring here and wrap it around the pedestal and that'll make sure that this doesn't get legs in the middle of the

{"id": "wyBT9J_4yOw", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "3nOSKQugmdPCHetGT2ko-dc2-aM", "transcript": "hey this is Eric with techno RV and in this informational video I'm going to tell you everything that you need to know about the VY air 300 RVs so in March of 2019 V air came out with four brand new models they were all designed specifically for different types of RVs the 300 version here is designed for towables and smaller RVs so let's go ahead and talk about this unit here to make sure that that you get all the information that you need first of all the unit comes with a 30-foot air hose here and it built into the air hose is an inflator / deflator and it also has a air gauge built into it that goes up to a hundred and 50 psi and again that's a 30-foot hose and then the power cord that comes with this unit again it's a 12-volt unit is the power cord is eight feet so you got eight feet of power and then another thirty feet here to make sure that you get to the those tires on your your towable there now again it is a 12 volt power source here so you're gonna connect this directly to your batteries in either your vehicle or your RV and you will want to make sure that if you're going to connect this to your the battery in your vehicle that you connect this to your battery and then you turn your vehicle on this units designed to get 13.8 volts and when it's running it will start pulling down that voltage on the battery so by having your vehicle turned on that'll make sure you've got plenty of voltage if you're gonna plug it in to your RVs batteries then you will need to make sure that your RV is connected to shore power this unit also comes with an aluminum fan tray and in that that tray is also a vibration isolator if you you take this unit and just move it back and forth a little bit you can see it kind of floats in that tray right there so it really takes that that vibration from the unit away from it and that's really really nice you also get a three piece inflation tipped kit in this and that's basically you'll get the tip that you can blow up a basketball or a football and and then a couple of other tips for other inflatables that you may have in your RV or whatever you take with you on the road so that's really nice that this unit can also take care of those needs as well the duty cycle rating on this unit is 33% at a hundred psi and and what that means is that it can run at a hundred psi for 20 straight minutes and then it needs to rest for 40 minutes to cool down and so that's a good rating it's got a maximum working pressure of a 150 psi so it can really take care of a lot of the needs that you're going to have out there especially for for a towable or a smaller type RV the unit does have a thermal overload protector built into it so it's going to make sure that if it starts getting overheated for any reason that it's going to be able to detect that and protect itself this is really a compact unit so let's talk about the dimensions here of this unit here it is it is nine inches long it is four point nine inches wide here and seven and a half inches tall so it's really a nice compact unit all these by air units are really compact which makes it great for RVs you don't have these an air compressor in one of these big tanks with it that are kind of cumbersome to take with you on the road so so one of the advantages of these vias is that they're nice and compact now you do get this nice bag with the unit and that bag is going to carry everything that you see here your hoses and your vy air unit and it's really a nice bag this newer model by Ayers that were just released in March of nineteen that they one of the things they did is they really upgraded this bag here so you can really tell the difference between this bag and the older model backs another thing that you'll notice in addition to its compact size is that this unit only weighs just a little above eight pounds so it's really easy to manage nice and small you can tuck it away somewhere and when you do need to pull it out you're not going to hurt your back trying to carry this thing around so just so you have an idea of how quickly this unit works you can take a Tobal size tire and take it from 80 psi to 90 psi and in only forty four seconds so the units compact but it really packs a lot of power and it's really going to allow you to get your tires up to pressure quickly so that's all the information on the VY year our BES model so go ahead and give us a thumbs up and if you've got any additional questions about this unit you can always place those questions in the comments and we'll be sure to get right back to you you can also contact us directly at techno our vidcom you can email us chat with us or you can give us a call and of course you can get all the by ear models from techno RV comm", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2019-06-20T01:44:04Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "Features of the

{"id": "sLl8v3-heHc", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "Al2Z7imX93yjP6hB9qdfO4PU-QY", "transcript": "hey this is Eric over at techno RV and in this information video I'm going to tell you everything that you need to know about the Vieira are es model so in March of 2019 by air rolled out a whole new line of air compressors specifically designed for certain types of RVs and it covers all of the RVs so the 450 model here is designed for Class A RVs and all those RVs with the bigger tires this is the one you're going to want to want to get here the older model VY airs ended in just RV the new by year's end in RVs so when you go to get your Vieira Vieira that ends in RVs we carry all these at techno RV comm and we only carry the new models so if you get them from us you know you're getting the latest model of the air so let's get in and talk about the specifics of kind of everything you get here with the buy air for 50 RVs the first thing I want to point out is did you get 60 feet of hose and you get to individual 30 foot links and that's going to be good it's going to cover any size RV that you may have it's going to ensure that you can get back to those tires with that length hose there that comes with the kit in addition it comes with an 8 foot power cord here and of course it's a 12-volt model so this these will go and clamp directly to your batteries on your vehicle or your RV and it's it's really works well when it's getting full voltage at 13.8 volts so whenever you connect this to say a vehicle the vehicle needs to be running so that that battery stays charged if you're connecting this to your RVs batteries then you need to make sure you're connected to shore power so that those batteries stay charged up so eight feet of cable and these heavy-duty 12-volt comes with the unit here by ear has always been known for their nice compact unit which is great for the RV industry and our RVs because we don't like things that take up a lot of space and this 450 model it measures in at twelve point four inches in length here it measures five point eight inches wide and then it is seven and a half inches tall so nice and compact and then from a weight standpoint it only weighs in at about 13 pounds so this unit is very very manageable it's not like one of those big tank compressors that you may be used to seeing that are a little bit more cumbersome and difficult to kind of look around your RV so Vie air always hits a home run as it relates to compact the compact nature of their units the 450 sits on a vibration resistant diamond plated sand tray here and that gives you a nice base that no matter where you said it you've got a nice base and then it sits like it's just kind of floating on the diamond plate here and I don't know if you can see that but even if I just wiggle that you can see it's almost like it's just floating there so it really absorbs any vibration that you may get from this it's a really quiet running unit also with the 450 kits you're going to get this nice gas station style air gun here with a gauge that goes up to a hundred and sixty psi that comes with the kit that's very nice and you get to what we'll call I guess tips with it here's the 45-degree Chuck that you can connect to this so if you've got an inside duel that you're really trying to get in there and get after this Chuck here will help you out quite nicely but my favorite one which was a nice addition to the new RVs models is that they're including this now 40 inch length of hose with a twist on Chuck so basically I would just connect this hose to the air gun and and then I would twist this Chuck directly on to my valve stem now because of the length of it what this allows me to do is stand up while I'm airing up that tire so this is going to keep me from having to be down on my hands and knees while I'm airing out my tire it's genius to me it may not seem like a big deal but trust me not having to be down on your hands and knees is is a positive for for an RV R as we air up our tires so I really think that's a nice feature for the V air for 50 this kit also comes with a three piece inflator tip kit and so that just means that you've got the the tip that you can air up a football or a basketball and it's got a couple other tips so whatever inflatable that that you have you'll you'll likely have a tip for it and that's just another advantage of the buy air that you can air up most of your inflatables let's talk about the duty cycle rating for the 450 the duty cycle rating is 100% at 100 psi so that means that this unit can run at a hundred psi for a solid hour and then it needs to rest for an hour now the maximum PSI rating is up to a hundred and fifty psi so it really cranks out the power for you there in addition it's got a thermal overload protector with an automatic shutoff function so if you were to start overheating this unit it would detect it and shut itself off to kind of save the unit so you've got everything here you got to have somewhere to put it so the VY air for 50 comes with this nice bag it's actually an upgraded bag to the regular RV model the RVs model comes with a much sturdier bag it's one of the upgrades they made to this new unit here and everything you see here fits in this bag and they've even a got a couple of additional pockets here that you can fit some additional items in it if you want to so that's everything that you need to know about the buy year for 50 RVs if you learn something give me a thumbs up if you've got questions be sure to write those questions in the comments section of this video and we'd be happy to answer those for you you can get more information about the viaduct right at techno RV comm and you can buy them there as well we only carry the newer version the RVs model at techno RV comm when you go to our site we've got good information you can email you can chat with us or you can call us whatever you like we're always here to help you in addition on our youtube channel if you're still a little bit unsure about the proper buy air model that you need we've got a video that we talk about each individual model in and maybe give you a little bit more insight and help on which model would be best for you so get on over to techno RV comm and check out the V air compressors the rvs model", "snippet": {"publishedAt":

{"id": "vOXJNeshLvU", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "FFIV2Y9yvg3vvNG3K-iA04fugx0", "transcript": "hey this is Eric at techno RV and today I want to talk to you about the new line of VY air air compressors in March of 2019 VY air rolled out an entire new line of air compressors specifically designed for certain classes of RVs and they cover all of the classes so it really comes down to which one of these particular compressors meets your needs based on what your RV is so let me just give you a quick kind of a brief run-through of each one of these air compressors and keep in mind I have detailed videos on each single one of these on the techno RV YouTube channel so you can always go check out those videos to get detailed information on these models so let's start down here this is the V air 89 RVs and when you see the RVs that means that it's the new model of VY air the old model of ie airs just ended in RV so you need to be looking for RVs that's the units that you want and it's the only ones that we carry a techno RV or these newer models the 89 RVs is designed for Class B RVs the VY air 300 RVs is designed for towables the 400 RVs is designed for Class C motorhomes and the 450 RVs is designed for class a motor homes so that's kind of the division between the four new models now I want to break it down for you a little bit more because there is some gray area in there that we may need to clear up for you number one if you're in a class be there is no gray area this is the model that you want to get it's small its compact it comes with a 10-foot power cable and a 20-foot air hose with a twist on Chuck it has the PSI gage built into the unit it's really small and you're going to love that for your Class B so the air hose is plenty long for a Class B it's got the power to air up those tires again there's really no gray area if your Class B van life that type thing the 89 is going to be great for you the at this point I want to skip all the way to the 450 and then we'll discuss these two models because this may be where we get into some a little bit of overlap here if you're in a big class a you know that then you're gonna want to get the the 450 RVs you got the big 20 2.5 s you know it's a big motorhome 36 38 40 45 feet you're gonna want the 450 RVs it's gonna have the power to do everything that you need it's gonna have 60 feet of air hose it's gonna have a a Chuck extender that's going to help you to get to those inside duals and it's also going to have a twist on Chuck that will allow you to air up your tires while you're kind of standing up so you don't have to be on your hands and knees the whole time so Class A owners those big class A's 450 RVs don't think any more about it that's the one you need to get so it's these two models right here that we probably need to spend a little bit more time with because towables can range in size drastically I mean you can you can have a 10-footer or you can have a 45 foot fifth-wheel these days and depending on what you have may push you from one of these models to another now the 300 RVs is is the one that's designed for towables and the the 400 is said to be more for like Class C motorhomes so what's really the decision here because this 300 RVs for the size of a towable tire it will certainly put the air to them with no problem and it's it's a little bit smaller just from the the compactness of it so if you can do this one and you're in a towable then that would be nice the main thing to consider is that it comes with 30 feet of hose whereas the 400 comes with 60 feet of hose so let's kind of talk about that a little bit the the 300 comes with this 30 foot length of hose and it's got the air gauge built into it okay the inflator deflator gauge here and that's what you get with the 300 so now let's say I'm in a 40-foot 5th wheel well I might just want to go ahead and get the 400 at that point because with the 400 I'm getting 60 feet of air hose just like you get with the 450 model I'm also getting the gas-station style air gun with the gauge built into it that measures up to 160 psi I am getting the 45 degree air Chuck that it's really helpful if you have a dual tire now if you're in a towable that's not going to apply but maybe you want to use this just to air up your tires in addition it's got the 40 inch hose with the air Chuck attached to it so this would attach to the gun here and then this would twist on to your valve stem and now I can stand up and air up my tires that's what you get with the 400 model so again if you've got a larger towable even though the 300 is designed for towables for me if I've got a longer towable then I'm probably gonna go ahead and get the 400 model if I've got a smaller towable and that you know the 30 foot of air hose will be just fine in all scenarios then then the 300 RVs will be just fine so that's kind of the brief overview of all of the new rvs vie air models here and kind of how you might go through making the decision on which model is right for you again I've got detailed videos of each one of these you can go check out and we sell all of these models at techno RV dot-com so

{"id": "XBpcgmn1oaE", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "GICqK4bb15ChIBaxbtlmkFeEBlg", "transcript": "hey this is Eric with techno RV and in this informational video I'm going to tell you everything that you need to know about the vyerni line of air compressors was released in March of 2019 and you can tell if it's one of the newer VY airs because it it ends in RVs the previous models ended in just RV so when you get your by air you want to make sure you get the one that ends in RVs and we've got them all at techno RV comm so let's go ahead and talk about the vyerni nine what they did is they have four models and they have paired them specifically with certain types of RVs the v89 is a 12-volt portable tire inflator designed for Class B RVs it's going to fill most class b RV tires from 80 to 90 psi in less than two minutes so it's a strong little unit here let's get into the specifics here about the unit here it has a built in tire pressure gauge that goes up to a hundred and twenty psi it's built into the unit right here it has a LED and work light on the front of the unit here so that's going to be nice to have that as well it's got your dual battery clamps red on red and black on black when you go to hook this up to your your 12-volt battery and and so that's really nice because when you're in your RV or you're out in your vehicle then you're just going to connect this directly to the battery of say your vehicle or your RV to get power to this unit so that's really nice it's got a a 20 foot air hose that comes with this unit it's built right in and it terminates to a solid brass Chuck here that you're going to twist directly onto your valve stem and so you don't have to sit there on your hands and knees at the tire because that's just going to twist on there and then you're going to turn the unit on and it's going to air the tire up so I really like that feature there it comes with a three piece inflation tip kit so you'll get like the the tip that'll air up like a basketball or a football and then a couple of other tips that will help you air up other things like maybe an air mattress or some other inflatable let's get into more of the specifics here it is operational off of 12 volt power 13.8 volt is what it's looking for so what that means is that if you're going to connect this to your car battery then you need to connect it and then make sure that the vehicle is running so that it can keep that voltage level up if you're going to connect it to your RVs batteries then you would need to be connected to shore power to keep the voltage up on those batteries it is the duty cycle rating on this is 25 minutes at 30 psi and what that means is it can run solid for 30 minutes there are at 30 psi for 25 minutes and then it needs to rest for 35 minutes so that's the duty cycle rating it does have a maximum work pressure up to a hundred and 20 psi so it's got a lot of power here the max tire size for this particular unit right here would be a 245 70 19 and a half inch wheel so keep that in mind the max ambient temperature that this can operate at is a hundred and fifty eight degrees the minimum ambient temperature is negative four degrees and the dimensions of this is really what I want to point out here because I hope you can really get a vibe of how small this unit is but it's it's a nine-point eight inches in length here it's only 3.2 inches wide here and only five point six inches high and so it's really super portable unit and again that would be great for Class B RVs it fits in this bag here which the measurement of this bag is six and a half inches tall here by ten and a half inches long by six inches wide so it's really a small bag it will tuck someone somewhere really out-of-the-way for you here so the net weight of it is only four point seven five pounds the air hose is twenty feet and the power cable here is 10 feet so for a Class B that's going to be plenty to get to those back tires so it'll have plenty of link there for you as far as fill rates I want to talk just a little bit about that if you want to fill a 33 inch tire up from say 50 to 60 psi then it'll do that in just a little bit over a minute if you want to fill that 33 inch tire up from 60 to 80 psi it'll be about three and a half minutes to do that and that same tire from say 80 to 90 psi it'll do that in about a minute forty so it's really got a lot of power it's super compact I really love this unit and you can get this at techno RV calm", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2019-06-02T03:30:16Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "Features of the new VIAIR 89P-RVS RV Air Compressor - Class B Motorhomes", "description": "The VIAIR 89P-RVS is part of the newest line of VIAIR Air Compressors.

{"id": "-u2umT-zbes", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "dL5VLN8hPce_3KNTQv8ifwuLaFo", "transcript": "hey this is Eric at techno RV and in this video I want to talk about the surge guard for zero 301 wireless monitor that works with the surge guard 34 951 in the 34 931 units and really in this video I just want to show you what the screen looks like and all of the information that you will be getting from this wirele wireless monitor and in essence it's pulling the information from my surge guard unit that's out on the power pedestal so let's take a look at what you get on the screen here okay so this is the screen that you will be seeing and what you'll notice is that I don't know every 8 or 10 seconds the screen will go into sleep mode and that is to preserve the battery life takes three Triple A batteries and you'll see it goes into sleep mode there and to wake it up you can just hit any button so I'm just going to hit this left hand button here and it will fire it back up so here's my battery life over here it's basically saying RV on if you see something that says no link that means that you are not connected to the surge guard unit and that you will need to go through the setup process I've got another video showing that also this is your signal strength over here it's showing that I've got very low signal strength but I've always got good connection here so I wouldn't so much worry about the signal strength bar because I can show low signal strength medium signal strength but yet I've always got my data coming in here so let's just take a look at what we have here and by the way I'm keeping the the unit on from going to sleep just every few seconds or so I'm tapping the left hand button you just may not be able to see what I'm doing down there but what you have here is you have your volts this is for a 50 amp unit right here because I've got two hot lines coming in so the voltage on line one is a hundred and twenty-one volts you can see that right here and line two is also under volts so I've got great voltage here my frequency is set is it 60 Hertz which is exactly where it needs to be and then on your upper right-hand screen here you've got the number of amps that you're drawing per line so I'm drawing 17 amps on line one and I'm drawing 26 amps on line two and then you've got your kilowatts reading down in the lower right-hand corner now to show you how accurate this is I'm gonna have Tammy turn on the microwave and then you'll see the amps jump up so you can hear her clicking away back there and she just turned the microwave on you can see that the line one jumped up to 29 amps so you can see as soon as you start drawing more amps on a particular line it's going to show you that very quickly now you've got three buttons down here on the bottom and and basically the right and left buttons are to scroll through the different screens you have so if I go all the way to the left this is the screen I'm gonna see if I hit my right hand button then the next one it's going to say hey do I have any active faults right now so let's say I had a low voltage issue and my unit cut me off because of that then it would show me that right here the next screen is basically my historical faults that I may have had if I hit the left or the right button again I'm sorry and and then if I hit the right button again it's basically just giving you the model number and and and so that's kind of all you have there so then if I just hit the left button to go back again this is the screen I like to stay on you can mount this unit somewhere if you like I don't do that I just leave it on the counter and if I ever need to pick it up and kind of see what's going on out of the pedestal then I can just hit a button and see what's going on here if I ever were to have a fault in the middle of the night and my power went off and I want to see what was going on and I would just pick my unit up I could hit the left button and then start scrolling with the right button and see what kind of faults I had going on there so it's really a great unit to get that information from your surge guard that customarily before this model came out you had to go out to the pedestal to read this information and now you can get it right off of the screen right here so the middle button on this unit is that's designed if you need to do a hard reset to delete out the the current surge guard unit to maybe resync up with a different surge guard unit there is a sequence that you would use that middle button to do a hard reset and there's instructions on that that comes with the unit and I've also made a video about that as well so there you have it that's pretty much everything you need to know about the wireless monitor that is designed again to be used with the surge guard portable units number 34 951 and 34 931", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2019-05-29T23:45:02Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "What

{"id": "2ex3uVoHRgE", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "SHGQ4a2zkjQDDbrSP5_1qrnGA4s", "transcript": "hey this is Eric at techno RV and in this video I'm going to tell you everything that you need to know about the surge guard 34 951 total electrical protection system so let's jump right in and talk about what this unit can do for you the 951 version was just released in January of 2019 so this is the newest model so how these work is that you're going to plug this unit into the electrical pedestal and then you're going to plug your RV into the receptacle at the bottom of the unit and then you'll flip the breaker on the pedestal and this units going to run a 10 second analysis on the pedestal to basically make sure that it's wired correctly it's going to make sure that it's got a proper neutral a proper ground no reverse polarity issues make sure there's no high or low voltage at the time of startup and if everything is okay then it will just cross the power over to your RV and it does all this in ten seconds so once the power is crossed over to your RV then this unit is going to continue to monitor for high and low voltage so anything below a hundred and two or above a hundred and thirty two this unit will basically cut you off from that power because that's outside of a range that would be safe for the electronic components inside of your RV it's also got a great surge suppressor so this can handle up to forty two hundred joules of energy and that is a lot it's the highest level of any unit on the market in this unit right here the other thing that this unit does that no other unit on the market does everything that we've been talking about that power coming from the pedestal that's called line side protection this surge guard unit also gives you what's called load side protection and what that means in a 50 amp RV is that this unit will actually be able to detect open neutral conditions and elevated ground currents inside of your RV so if you lose a neutral inside of your RV then you can have what's called accidental 242 where those two hotlines can actually come together and instead of having a hundred and twenty volts going to each side you may have like two hundred volts you know go onto one side like forty going to the other very bad very dangerous for your RV and your RVs electrical components this will protect you against that it'll also detect elevated ground currents inside of your RV I mean you really shouldn't have you know current on the ground line but if you this unit if it detects you get up to about thirty volts this unit will detect that it recognizes that it's a problem and it's going to cut you off from that this unit is also weather resistant I'm a full time RV R I've got this unit sitting outside the the surge guard units 365 days a year I've had them in snow rain storms whatever they are total weather resistant and so you just don't you just want to make sure that if you're on a low pedestal this just isn't sitting in water that wouldn't be good but just weather rain snow whatever it can handle it all also the cabling on this unit here surge guard is owned by South wire south wire is the largest manufacturer of electrical cabling in North America and they own surge guard so it makes sense that they would put their own electrical cabling on this unit so you get all of this high quality cabling on the surge guard unit so this is south wire cable this is a patented head with the the t-handle that actually makes it easy for you to pull this off of the pedestal receptacle it's also got a t-handle on the back here and what this does is this makes it easy then for you to grab this and connect your rv's power cable from this unit it also comes with a locking cable ring so what this does is it basically allows you to take like a cable lock or a chain and a lock and lock this unit to the power pedestal to keep those would-be thieves away so that is a very nice feature there for those that may be concerned about somebody taking this from the power pedestal the LCD display here is a dual line display and that's very nice so what you're going to get on this dual line displays it's gonna tell you that what your voltage is per line and it's gonna tell you how many amps you're drawing per line now the big deal about this new 951 model that's different from any other model on the market even previous surge guard models is that they've added a wireless adapter inside of this unit and that wireless adapter can connect to an optional monitor that would fit inside of your RV so one of the things that that we've been asked a lot about about these portable units is hey if something happens in the middle of the night your power gets cut off you know you would have to have to walk outside you're in your pajamas to kind of see what's going on on the display well now with this wireless adapter you can get this optional display that sits inside of your RV it's going to sync up with this unit outside and give you the data right here on this display so now here you'll be seeing a line one line two voltage how many amps you're drawing and if you were to have some kind of fault it would just tell you right on the screen so there's no codes to read with surge guard if you have an open neutral or a low voltage then it's just gonna say that in plain English it'll just say low voltage it's not going to give you some code that then you have to kind of go look up so I really like that about the surge guard too so that is one of the big deals with the 951 this year is that you can get this optional monitor and see the data from your portable unit inside of your RV now this unit also has the best warranty on the market it has a lifetime warranty with what's called connected equipment coverage what this means is is if this fails to do what it was intended to do and something in your RV gets damaged surge guard will actually pay the cost of whatever got damaged so you really can't beat that I mean these are units that are going to protect your RV and and you're just going to know you're protected because you've got the best unit in on the market with this surge goal guard 951 designed for 50 ant rvs now we've got these over at techno RV comm and so you need to go check them out there and we've got a lot of information over there for you to look at of course if you have any questions you can you can email us you can chat with us you can call us when you go to the product pages you'll have a few options to add items to this unit when you put it into the cart one is of course you can add the wireless display which I would highly recommend another thing that you can add is we have the cable locks in stock so if you want to just go ahead and and a cable lock that you can use with the included locking ring here then you can go ahead and add that as well the other thing we did is we just went ahead and add it thirty to fifty amp adapter so 30 amp male to 50 amp female so if you're ever in a part in your 50 amp ring and they only have 30 amp service then you need a good one and that's all again that's all that Southwire cabling the south wire

{"id": "UOhl1o54r9A", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "TWEe7PFcMqVS5_MaXZJWbuki1tw", "transcript": "hey this is Eric at techno RV and today I want to talk a little bit about the TST tire pressure monitoring system versus the tire minder tire pressure monitoring system and I wanted to do this just from my own personal experience because when we go to like RV shows and we sell the tire the TST system on our website at techno RV comm we get a lot of questions about hey what are the differences in these two systems I've got another video where I've totally went over specs and just the facts about these systems but as a personal user I just wanted to briefly let you know why I choose the TST system a it's the only color monitor available on the market I like the color monitor it seems more brilliant to me I feel like I can see it better the tire minder does only has a black and white monitor probably the main reason is that TST shows both points of data pressure and temperature all on the same screen and it does what's called auto scrolling that means a tire will be blinking on the monitor whichever tires blinking on that screen I'm getting pressure and temperature of that tire position five seconds later it moves to another tire position and then that's the data I'm getting for that tire and it does this non-stop as I'm driving so with a quick glance I can always see what's going on with my tires while I know it's gonna alarm me if I have some kind of condition that I need to be alarmed about i as an RV R like knowing that at a glance I can see what's going on with my tires unfortunately with the tire minder system it after about eight or ten seconds of being on the system goes into what's called I guess a sleep mode and you get no data like like while you're driving down the road if you look at a tire minder there's you can just see the outline of your rig but there's no information there so to me this is just no good for our veer because it's an RV or I know that that me and you we want to see that information while we're going down the road now of course the tire mind will alarm you if you go if something happens but the ability to be able to look over there to quit and see what's going on I love that feature in the tire pressure monitoring system from TST also the TST gives you two sensor choices a flow-through sensor that allows you to air up your tires through the sensor without taking it off the valve stem and they offer a low profile cap sensor I love the flow through sensor on my RV I'm in a motor home right now and a tow a Jeep I love having this online motor home and then I put the lower profile cap on my Jeep that I'm towing if I was using a tire minder system they only offer a caps assist a sensor so I like the flow-through sensor from the TST as it relates to my RV another thing that I like about the TST system is the warranty obviously the longer warranty I can get the better the TST has a three year comprehensive warranty while the tire minder just has a one year warranty so a full-time RV so if there was a manufacturing defect or something like that I would likely figure that out pretty quick because I'm on the move all the time if you're not on the move all the time and you just RV maybe a couple of two three four times a year you may not pick those defects up in that time period so it bottom line is a longer warranty is always better and the TST has a three year warranty versus tire minder that has a one year warranty so the other thing that I know about TST it's truck systems technology so these systems are used in the trucking industry like million mile trucks so I know that TST builds quality into their systems that can keep up with a unit that travels that much and the tsts are also starting to come as stock equipment on like brand new units from Forest River I know some other RV companies are starting to look at them for that and they are the only ones that are being considered for that in the RV industry so I know that from a quality standpoint they've been thoroughly vetted in the RV RV industry is also recognizing that as well so TSCA actually TST is actually owned by a company called PSS the largest manufacturer of auto inflation systems for the trucking industry in the world this is a big company it's got a lot of research and development resources and so I know that the latest and greatest is always going to be in the TST systems and I like knowing that about the system that I have so for all those reasons it's really it's really not even close for me it's it's the very reason that as a company techno RV sales the TST because personally is an RV R it's what I chose after testing a lot of units on the market so as it relates to TST versus really any of the systems on the market TST in my opinion is the best system out there so if you're interested in more information about the TST tire pressure monitoring system go to techno RV comm we've got a lot of learning resources on our website we've got a phone number you can call in and and talk to us we got chat features so we're always here to make sure that you get your questions answered about

{"id": "rT4XkVJ_-4c", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "4oPPKH7Fwi36RVK6IzXcgn7HrsE", "transcript": "hey this is Eric from techno RV and I want to show you the differences here between what you see going down the road on the tire mind or a 1 a and the TST tire pressure monitoring system so on the left hand side right here I've got the tire minder a 1a in the middle I've got the color monitor TST 507 and then on the far right I've got the black and white monitor TST model so the 2 on the right or TST is the one on the left is the tire minder and the main point of interest here is that the tire minder actually goes into kind of a I guess a sleep mode to where you really don't see anything on the screen any point of data or anything like that and the TST as you can see is very bright you can see them and they are auto scrolling giving me both my temperature and my psi of my tire so it a quick glance going down the road I can see what is going on with my tires now of course if I go into alarm they will all alarm me and let me know I've got an issue and let me show you here on the tyre minder that if I want to see data on the tyre minder I need to reach up here and hit a button now mind you while I'm driving down the road I need to hit it now it does brighten up and I see that I'm it's 53 degrees now if I want to see the pressure in that tire I need to hit it again to show that it's 28 psi and my Jeep on my back right and then if I hit it again it shows me that it's 53 degrees on that back right but if I just let that sit for I don't know eight ten seconds or so it just goes dark again and that's what I see going down the road now as a as an RVer I like to see the data while I'm going down the road and that's what the TST does not only does it give you a great screen to look at but it also gives you both points of data on the same screen while the tire minder just gives you one or the other and then you have to scroll through to see more data another thing you may notice I hope it shows up on this video is that the the antenna on the tire minder is nine inches and that's in the manual says that must be out for it to work so there it is it's and then the type of course the TST just has these little stubby built-in antennas so that gives you an idea of what you see going down the road the difference between the tire minder a1a that goes into sleep mode and gives you nothing versus the TST that autoscrolls and give you both points of data for your tires and continues to scroll through your tire so in a quick glance you can see all the information that you want to see from these systems so I want to show you what it sounds like and looks like whenever these systems go into alarm so I'm gonna start with the TST and just for the sake of demonstration I'm just gonna go ahead and turn off this black and white system here so both of them are NAND alarm and I will just focus on this one here so I'm gonna have Tammie go ahead and unscrew a sensor from the tire this is gonna mimic a rapid pressure release so she's outside doing that now and this one is going to go and alarm this is what it sounds like and this is what you see it shows you the tire that's in alarm the point of data that's in alarm which is pressure is blinking it shows you your low pressure and it's a fast leak now to silence that I just hit any button on the front but it stays in alarm with the red LED blinking until I resolve whatever that issue is so Tammy's going to put the sensor back on the tire and it'll clear that but in the meantime I'm gonna go ahead and here is the tire minder here and I'm going to go ahead and have Tammy to unscrew a sensor from a tire for the tire minor we let's see what the tire minder looks like here when it goes into alarm so she's unscrewing the sensor and okay so it goes into a lower so you see you get the flashing red light you get down bottom it shows leaking and pressure now it automatically stops blinking or audible alarming without me pushing anything here but I've still got the blinking leaking and pressure being the issue down here so I'm gonna go ahead and and just press this and see that it says zero psi there on that tire position there so that's what you've got in the LED light will stay blinking until you've resolved whatever the issue is for that position so that's what it looks like when you go into alarm on both units and then of course the tire minder oh we'll just after a few seconds it'll go back into sleep mode just like that that's what you'll see going down the road on the TST this is what you'll see so I hope that was helpful for you to see visually those units in action there and for me as a full-time rver I got to tell you that the the visibility of the TST and the information that it shows you in real-time while you're going down the road versus the tire minder that goes in that sleep mode and really doesn't give you any information as you're driving that's one of the main reasons that not only do I choose TST as a full time RV R but as the owner of TechKnow RV I choose to sell the TST brand so if you use TST and you want to write in the comments why you love it have at it if you're a tire minder user and you want to give some specific reasons as to why you love the the tire minder and its features then feel free to write that as well you can also check out on our youtube channel we've got a lot of videos of tips and tricks and how to use and and all the information you could ever want about the TST system is on the techno RV youtube channel go there subscribe

{"id": "_jlopo-k9us", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "7l5ToKoMid4xu0jDV3unGJH0w1c", "transcript": "hey this is Eric at techno RV and in this video I'm going to compare the specs and features of the TST tire pressure monitoring system compared to the tire minder tire pressure monitoring system well we just left the 2019 Tampa RV show and these are the models that were being displayed it's the TST 507 and the tire minder eight one eight so you may have heard of the TST or tire minder and you may be asking yourself why do you need a tire pressure monitoring system well the leading indicator of a blowout is low tire pressure and high temperature an entire pressure monitoring system is going to monitor these two points of data and it's going to alarm you should you get out of spec as it relates to what you should be on those two points of data so specifically what I'm gonna do is I'm going to take the facts about the specs and features of these two and just line by line let's just go through them so at the end of this you'll have a real clear indication of which system that you feel like would be best for you and at the end of the video I'm also going to talk about the system that I use and specifically why so I've got my clipboard here and everything that I'm going to give you right here is straight off the website or owner's manuals from either TST or tire minder and so let's just go ahead and get started so the first thing that I want to cover is just monitor size the TST tire pressure monitoring system here is a 2.4 inches tall this way and four and a half inches long the tire minder kind of has a different configuration because TST is more in landscape mode and tire minder is more in portrait mode so on the tire minder you've got two point four inches this way and four point one inches tall so the tsts just a little bit bigger but both of them seem to have a screen size that is totally acceptable the monitor power they both have a rechargeable battery in them and and in general you can get say two to four weeks on average off of one charge and the reason that is because you can get about 16 to 20 hours say of just straight drive time and generally people may drive for you know four or five six hours and then they may stop for a week so the the weeks that may vary but the hours if you just turn it on and left it on you're talking about sixteen to twenty hours they both are charged with a USB charger that has a also a 12-volt cigarette lighter style charger that comes with it and they both just have an on and off type switch to turn the unit on and to turn the unit off so that's real simple the color as it relates to these two models this is where things start to get a little bit different between these two the TST model is actually the only system on the market that offers a color monitor so the TST offers a a color monitor and a black-and-white monitor as well and then the tire minder just offers a a black and white monitors as it relates to the antennas on these the TST just has a short little stubby antenna here on the top and that the tire minder has like a pullout it's a nine inch like pullout type antenna and it is designed according to the tire minder handbook that that does need to be pulled out and fully extended while driving down the road so both systems operate off of a radio signal and both systems include what's called a signal repeater so they have antennas on them and that's all well and good but they both come with what's called a signal repeater they just take 12 volt power and once you give it 12-volt power it boosts the signal between the sensors that are on the valve stems of each tire forward towards the monitor so both of them have that they're both included in the system and yes if you get one of these systems you do need to install the repeater no matter how large or small that your rig may be another feature that I want to talk about is the information that you actually see on the screen as you're going down the road so you'll have the monitor with you in your RV or truck whatever you're in and so at a quick glance you can look at the monitor so with the TST model it autoscrolls this means there will be a blinking tire and whatever tires blinking it'll display your psi and your temperature of that tire position all on the same screen five seconds later it'll move to the next tire and it just Auto Scrolls continuously so always it a quick glance you can look over there and see what your tires are doing as you go down the road they'll heat up your PS I'll go up these are the characteristics that you'll be able to see in real time on the TST system tire minder takes a little different approach on this in that they only show psi on the screen so they don't show both points of data while it is monitoring both points of data it only shows one point of data at a time and if you want to see the other point of data you need to reach up and hit a button on the monitor for it to move to the next point of data and then if you want to see the next tire you need to hit another button to go to say psi hit a button to go to temperature so that part of it for the tire minder is a little more awkward because you're actually having to manually move between the points of data and your tires whereas with the TST again at a quick glance it's always auto scrolling you can always see that information all on the same screen the other thing is that with the tire minder after when you turn it on after about say eight to ten seconds it goes into really just like a sleep mode so really while you're going down the road you don't see any information on the screen you don't you don't see psi or temperature now again if you want to see it as I've already stated you you hit a button and then the screen will kind of light up and show you say psi if you want to see the next one you hit that and keep moving forward so again while going down the road if you look over at the tire minder at a quick glance then you see no data at all unless you hit one of the buttons on the TST you it autoscrolls and you'll always see the information and I think that's an important point to make here now both systems will alarm you if you have a low psi condition a high temperature condition so even with the tire minder even though it goes into that sleep mode and you really can't see anything just looking over at it still if you had a rapid pressure release high temperature it would alarm you that and so would the TST so as it relates to alarming they both have an audible alarm and they both have like a light little flash now to silence the alarm if you ever go into alarm you just hit any button on the front of either unit and it'll silence the audible alarm but the light will continue to flash until you resolve whatever the issue is one more point that when you go into alarm both of the systems when you go into alarm when you look it'll the tire that's in alarm will be flashing and then on the TST system the point of data that is an alarm will be flashing as well and then on the tire minder the point of data that is an alarm will just be on the screen so let's talk about available tire positions how many tires can you actually program into these systems so on the the TST you can put thirty-two tire positions on kind of the opening screen there so really as many as you want now TST also has the availability to add up to four different trailers so let's say you two have a towable and then you want to tow a trailer or something else you can get sensors for all of those and the TST system will intuitively know which of those you're actually towing so if you come in and you're say towable RV drop it off pick up a trailer and drive off the monitor will actually know say hey they this was dropped off now I need to start monitoring this trailer right here so that's kind of a nice feature on the tire minder it can monitor up to 22 tire positions and it does not have the availability to do multiple trainers so let's just talk about operating psi what levels that it can handle the TST can handle from zero psi to 218 psi the tire minder does from 0 psi to 232 psi so the tire minder has a little bit more of a range there however they're both totally acceptable because you know obviously you get into the 200s and there's not going to be a tire that would have a cold tire pressure of that amount that's going to be on an RV and even if you have a condition that your tire is heating up your pressures going up you're gonna be alarmed well before you get to that point so that you can get off the road so they're both totally acceptable on the psi range the operating temperature range for the TST is from negative 4 degrees Fahrenheit to 176 degrees Fahrenheit and the tire minder operating temperature is from negative 4 degrees to a hundred and 85 degrees Fahrenheit so again both of them have very acceptable operating temperatures and now this isn't the temperature at which the the system can be going to alarm for this is just what type of condition can say the sensors and the monitor actually operate in the accuracy of these two systems as it relates to pressure and temperature for the TST it's plus or minus three psi and plus or minus three degrees Fahrenheit the tire minder on the PSI side is plus or minus two point seven percent for the tire minder and plus or minus six degrees Fahrenheit for the tire minder so with a tire pressure monitoring system you're gonna set up parameters around what the cold tire pressure should be so that if you have like a slow condition that's like a slow leak or something like that and it gets outside of that parameter that you'll be alarmed so these systems work a little bit differently on that the TST allows you to manually set what you want that parameter to be now as it's recommended that you set it somewhere around ten percent below what the cold tire pressure is supposed to be in about 20 to 25 percent above what the cold tire pressure should be so you can manually adjust that with the TST system on the tire minder you actually cannot manually adjust that you actually put what your cold tire pressure is and then it sets the parameters for you and it sets it at fifteen percent below and twenty percent above whatever the cold tire pressure is that you put in so if you were out in in the the middle of the desert in the middle of the summer and your tires were heating up and let's say 20% above cold tire pressure was a normal condition because the ambient temperature was so high that it was driving your psi to that level you would go into alarm on the tire minder whereas with the TST you could actually just adjust that up by a few percentage points so that you wouldn't go into alarm for a normal condition as it relates to temperature the same thing on the TST you can manually set once you want to be alarmed at now the idea here is that a tire can start to break down at around 200 degrees + and so you want to be alarmed before that so with the TST system it comes automatically set at 158 degrees but you can adjust that so if you want to just that higher or just that lower you can make that manual adjustment on the TST on the tire minder you cannot make a manual adjustment it comes preset at 167 degrees and you cannot make an adjustment on that so two different thoughts from two different companies TST allows you to make those manual adjustments and tire minder presets them and then that's just kind of the end of it there is a feature that both of these systems have - where you can basically Park sensors that you have programmed into the monitor so let's say you've got an RV with a tow vehicle and let's say that you don't have your tow vehicle with you and you're just driving in your RV that you can own the the TST there's just two buttons that you hit and it'll basically drop off that tow vehicle and or you could drop off the RV if you wanted the unit to just be in your tow vehicle while you drive around and so the tire minder also has that feature now it's more of a programming thing with the tire minder as opposed to with the TST there's just two buttons you hit and it just does it so they both do it with the TST it's just a little easier so let's talk about programming the sensors into the monitor so when you get this system you're gonna need to program each sensor into a particular tire position on the monitor and they're both easy and the difference is with the the the TST you can actually program everything just at like a table whereas the tire minder you have to be at the tire position in order to program that sensor into the monitor you know a lot of our viewers may you may order a system get it maybe your RV is is in storage or something you don't have your RV with you but you want to go ahead and and program the system with the TST you can go ahead and do that you can just program it right there and then when you get to your RV you just put the sensors on the appropriate position with the tire minder you can't do that you need to be at the tire position in order to program the sensors into the monitor so let's talk about sensor options so we already know the idea here you're gonna have a sensor on each valve stem and then of course that sensor is going to broadcast forward to the monitor your your temperature and your psi and so with the TST system you actually have two options one is what's called a a cap sensor here and it's just a low-profile cap that would go on to the valve stem also offers what's called a flow-through sensor and this is a sensor that would allow you to air up your tire through the sensor without taking it off of the valve stem and so that's pretty nice to have the availability from TST to have a choice and you can mix and match these so you could put say a flow-through sensor on your your RV or truck or whatever and then put these on like a tow vehicle or something like that so that's pretty nice the the the tire minder has a cap sensor that they have available and that is the only option so again with the TST you get an option of cap and flow-through you can mix and match in with the tire minder you just have the cap sensor now all of these sensors have anti-theft features to keep someone from just walking up and taking them off of your valve stem so on the TST you have basically a little tool that you use with the cap sensor to put it on your valve stem and then if somebody tries to take it off it will just spin so that is the anti-theft feature for the TST cap sensor the anti-theft feature for the flow-through sin is that you would have a brass nut that you would put onto the valve stem first then you would put this onto the valve stem after the nut and then there's going to be a tool that you actually tighten and lock the sensor on to the valve stem the the tire minder is is comes with a tool as well and it works similar to what the flow-through sensor does for the TST you'll have a little nut that you'll put onto the valve stem you'll put this on after there and then this tool will allow you to lock that nut up against the sensor to keep someone from just unscrewing it off your valve stem so both of them have those anti-theft features that you don't have to use the anti-theft features if you don't want them but they do come with them to prevent theft so let's talk about the weight of these sensors now the sensors for the TST the sensor for the tire miner they're all less than an ounce so they're not going to affect any any balancing of your tires so there's nothing to be concerned that as it relates to that but specifically the flow-through sensor for the TST system is about 17 grams the cap sensor for the TST system is about 15 point 4 grams and the cap sensor for the tire minder is about 14 grams so again all of them less than an ounce and no issues as it relates to weight and your tires I will say that the flow-through sensor that you can get with the TST system you do need to put these on metal valve stems and that's really just because of the extra length this is the the flow-through sensor is about 2 inches whereas the cap sensor is about an inch tall so if you use the flow-through Center just make sure you use a metal valve stem and if you have rubber valve stems then you can use the cap sensor from the TST and also the tire minder all of the sensors come with user replaceable batteries this is a very nice feature when tire pressure monitoring systems came out they used to have these sealed sensors and you couldn't replace the batteries in them so TST and tire miner both have user replaceable batteries the batteries last about a year under normal use and it takes a 16 32 like just a little watch battery and changing out the batteries and these is very easy so both of these companies have it together as it relates to being able to replace these batteries yourself so when you get your systems the TST sensors will have those 16 32 batteries already installed in them on the tire minder system when you get them they send you the batteries but they're not in the sensors so when you get them you'll actually need to install those batteries first before you start programming it so as it relates to mounting options for these units the the TST system comes with two mounting options one of them is this suction cup mount here and the system also comes with a dash pad here if you want to mount this on the dash with the tyre minder you get this suction cup mount here if you want to mount it on to a window and it actually it does not come with a like a dash type mount so it's tire minder you just get the suction cup mount with TST you get a dash mount and a suction cup mount so what about the warranties for these two systems so with the TST they have a three year warranty this manufacturers warranty if you have an issue then you can contact whoever you purchase it from or the manufacturer and if there's anything wrong with it within three years they'll take care of it the tire minder has a one year warranty and kind of the same thing if you have any issues within that one year you can contact whoever you purchased it from or tire minded directly to get to get your warranty work done or to get something exchanged so I know that was a lot of information but that's the facts on both sides as it relates to TST and tire minder now I'm a full time RV and the owner of TechKnow RV I travel a lot in my RV and I do have a preference between these two systems I personally use the TST tire pressure monitoring system here specifically the reasons are I like the color monitor better than I like the black and white monitor and that and the tire minder just doesn't offer a color monitor mainly the fact that TST displays PSI and temperature on the same screen an auto scroll so at a quick glance I can see what's going on with my tires to me is the game changer as it relates to both of these systems the tire minder goes into sleep mode you see no information while you're going down the road with TST I can always peek over there and see what's going on I start to understand the characteristics of my tires for example my inner duals run hotter than my outside duals I can tell if the sun's coming in on this side I've got higher psi just all those things that happen while you're going down the road you start to learn those characteristics about your tires and and I like knowing that as well I don't have to reach up and hit buttons to scroll through this information it's Auto scrolling and with the tyre minder literally if I wanted to see information I would be driving trying to hit buttons and that's not something I'm interested in doing I certainly love the smaller antenna on the TST versus the big 9 inch antenna here on the tyre minder I don't feel like that's a good solution for an antenna for a system like this and the stubby antenna here to me is much better the warranty obviously a three-year warranty versus a one-year warranty is a big deal for me and any user and the fact that I have the option to have a flow-through sensor because currently I'm in a Motorhome in tow a cheap and I use the flow-through sensors on my motorhome and the cap sensors on my Jeep these are on my Jeep because they're a little bit lower profile I love the idea of being able to to put a little layer in my tires on my RV without taking those off and that option is just not available with the tire minder so again I personally choose the TST and the TST is also the system that that we sell at techno RV comm so if you're interested in a TST system then go to techno RV comm and you can get more information about them there you can always call us or chat with us if you ever have any questions if after watching this video you're more interested in the the tire minder then you can certainly find retail outlets out there to get one of those units as well I hope this has been helpful and I hope that everybody out there gets a tire-pressure-monitoring system I totally believe in them that that it's a must-have if you're an RVer so safe travels", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2019-01-31T02:33:36Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "TST 507 TPMS  vs TireMinder

Everyone has an opinion (you can read hundreds of them on Facebook if you ask the TPMS question), and then there are the facts and specifications about each system. There are some similarities and some very distinct differences in these two systems which are important to look at when making a decision to buy.

pressure monitoring system cap sensor to the 507 flow-through sensor and I hope by the end of the video that this will help you in determining which sensor is right for your particular situation and remember you can always get the TST systems at techno RV calm the TST 507 tire pressure monitoring system offers two different sensors one is the flow-through sensor and one is the cap sensor the obvious is that the flow-through sensor here allows you to air up your tires through the sensor without taking the sensor off of the valve stem the cap sensor you would need to take off of the valve stem in order to air up the tires and then you would just put the cap sensor back on let's go through other differences about these two and other things that are the same let's talk about measurements on the flow-through sensor it is 2.2 inches long from here to here it is one inch wide from here to here and it is 0.9 inches high which is going to be basically from the bottom to the top here the cap sensor is 1.2 inches from here to here and the diameter from here across is 0.9 of an inch so that's your measurements there as far as these two are concerned wait there is a little bit of a weight difference the cap sensor is 15 point 4 grams and the flow-through sensor is 22 grams both under an ounce and there is no need to rebalance your tires with either one of these as far as the psi range is the same for the - it's from 0 to 218 psi with an accuracy of plus or minus 3 psi the operating temperature range for both of these is from negative 40 Fahrenheit to a hundred and seventy-six degrees Fahrenheit with an accuracy of plus or minus three degrees so you should be covered in any weather conditions they are both pressure activated this means that whenever you screw these on to the valve stems they're activated so whenever you turn the monitor on it'll automatically start broadcasting information forward to the monitor both of them are going to broadcast the PSI of each tire position and it's going to also let you know what the temperature of each tire position is as well a lot of other systems on the market are not pressure activated you actually have to start moving before you get information TST is pressure activated which is much better both of these sensors have a battery in them and the battery compartment for the flow-through is just right here on the top you would just take these two screws out and both of them take ACR 16:32 battery for the cap sensor you would just take these three screws out here and that would expose a cap that you would then unscrew to see the battery I've got other videos on the techno RV youtube channel that shows you how to change the batteries out on these but both of them take a CR 1632 they both have anti-theft features the cap sensor comes with a tool and you basically just put the the claw tool around this and use this to put it on to the valve stem then if someone tries to take it off it will just spin very nice anti-theft feature there the flow-through sensor has an anti-theft measure as well and you'll have a brass nut for each flow-through sensor and this will go on to your valve stem first and then you would screw this on to the valve stem after it and then there is a claw tool that you would use to then tighten the brass nut up against the flow-through sensor so that you would not be able to take that off and I have other videos on our techno RV youtube channel that show me using the anti-theft measures here so another question we get asked is can either of these go on to any type of valve stem and the flow-through sensor here needs to go on to a metal valve stem the cap sensor here can go on either rubber valve stems or metal valve stems so keep that in mind flow through needs to go on metal cap sensor can go on either one the other thing that we get asked is can you mix and match these two for example could I put the flow through sensors say on my motorhome and put the cap sensors on my tow vehicle and the answer is yes you can definitely do that we do recommend that you always use a cap sensor for a tow vehicle oftentimes tow vehicles will have rubber valve stems but in addition they usually have shallower wheel wells and we just find that the that works better since this one has a shallower profile so now that you know everything you need to know about each TST sensor the flow-through and the cap how do you choose which one's best for you well this is really just a preference thing for me personally I use flow-through sensors on motor home and I used cap sensors on my tow vehicle when I used to be in a fifth wheel I ran cap sensors on my truck and flow through centers on my fifth wheel although I know plenty of people with fifth wheels that use cap sensors all the way around if I was in a smaller towable then I would use cap sensors all the way around just because they're a lower profile but there's some things that you can do to just answer some questions to maybe make it a little bit clearer for you there's a lot of different valve stem configurations out there and so the first thing that I would do when I'm trying to make this decision on which sensor is right for your situation is I would just look at the valve stems many valve stems may be hard to get to maybe they come through the wheels and the holes are really small maybe they have extenders maybe they have internal facing whatever you just need to go take a look at it and based on this information you've learned in this video first determine which sensor would just fit better it may be either one of them but once you've made that decision on what would just fit better on your RV tow vehicle whatever it is from there step two is I would then just ensure that the valve stems are either rubber or metal so if they're metal then you can use the flow-through sensor or the cap sensor if they're rubber valve stems then the decisions made for you you need to use the cap sensors for that okay step three first of all step one and two you may already have your decision but let's say that you've got metal valve stems you've got plenty of room so you could really use the cap or the flow-through sensor at this point it really does just come down to preference if you like the idea of a lower profile sensor that doesn't stick out quite as far then obviously you're going to want the cap sensor if you just love that feature of the flow-through being able to air up that tire through the sensor without taking it off then obviously get the flow-through sensor I will say again that we do recommend on tow vehicles that you do use the cap sensors most tow vehicles have rubber valve stems and those wheel wells are a lot shallower and so we'd like to see those cap sensors on tow vehicles also keep in mind that you can mix and match these we've kind of discussed this before but like me I used the flow through sensors on my motorhome cap sensors on my tow vehicle so if you find yourself in a situation that you could mix and match those and you like that configuration then go for it I hope this video has been helpful for you to learn everything there is to know about these two different types sensors from TST and I hope it makes it a little bit easier as you make your decision on which sensors to get with your DSD system so buy your TS t systems from techno

{"id": "adGCB_VINYk", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "rhUkQ9WnVtHHW3cOmpps5TZay6A", "transcript": "hey this is Eric with techno RV and today I just wanted to have a conversation about how to determine the correct tire pressure for your tires on your RV so whether you're in a bumper pull a fifth wheel or a Motorhome there's only one correct tire pressure for the load that you're carrying so the proper way to determine the tire pressure that you need in your tires is to get your RV weight and the proper way to do this is to get weighed at each tire position because RVs are built oftentimes with big slides they can not be balanced you could have an 800-pound slide on one side of the RV and a 400-pound slide on the other side of the RV and not to mention how we pack our RVs it can become very unbalanced so across an axle you could have one tire that is carrying a heavier load than the tire on the other side of the axle so you need to get weighed at each tire position so why not just weigh at say each axle position well let's think about this if I just got a weight across an axle and let's say that my tires are rated for 3,000 pounds each and let's say that I weight across the actual and I am at say 6,000 pounds so across the axle it appears that I'm okay but then if we went in and weighed at each tire position what if this tire was holding 4,000 pounds and this tire was holding 2,000 pounds so you can see really quickly how important it is to weigh at each tire position because it can be misleading to just weigh it by axle and then of course this kind of answers the next question of a wacky and adjust weigh my entire RV well that may be good to make determinations about gross vehicle weight ratings and things like that but as far as your tires are concerned you're really gonna need to weigh it at each tire position now once you do this you take that weight and you you want the same pressure across an axle so if this tire was holding 4,000 pounds and this tire was holding 2,000 pounds you would want to go with the pressure of the tire that was holding the the higher weight across that axle so take that weight each tire has a manufacturer's tire inflation chart and it will just simply tell you if there's this much weight on a tire here's the PSI that needs to go into that tire and and then that's what you need to do across that axle so make sure that you do that so let's talk about what if you have not been wage it well you need to plan to get weight first of all but if you haven't got wage yet under inflation is much worse than over inflation under inflation generates a lot of heat on the tire and heat is generally the death of a tire a tire can really start to break down at about 200 degrees and low pressure under inflation and ambient temperatures outside can really drive that heat up so again under inflation is worse than over inflation so if you haven't been weighed then you need to run the maximum tire pressure that the tire is rated for so you can find this on the outside of your tie here it'll just say hey your maximum psi is 120 at maximum load now you don't know if your maximum load yet because you haven't been weighed oftentimes people find that when they get way they're actually overloaded so if you haven't been weighed go with the max and then just plan on getting weighed as soon as you can so here's some frequently asked questions that we get once the tires heat up this is going to drive up the pressure in the tires and how much would you expect to see increase in pressure as you go down the road and it's pretty common to see 12 to 15 percent increase but if you have extreme temperatures outside remember those temperatures really drive the heat up and the heat drives the pressure up you could easily see 20 to 25 percent increase now another question we get asked is well what's what's too much and is it okay to run over the maximum of what the tire says that you're allowed to run so on your side while let's say it says you can run it 120 that's it cold tire pressure before you start running down the road and say it's 120 if you put 120 in it start rolling down the road you could go to 140 and that's okay the tire engineers that have built the tire inflation charts are very well aware that the PSI will drive up once you start going down the road and that's all built into it and that's okay so another question that I get asked is is once that tire pressure starts going up how much over the max tire pressure cold tire pressure of that tire is okay and I've talked to many tire engineers about this question and the bottom line is is that assuming that there's no damage to the tire any internal damage and it's a good tire that you would likely have your your rim would likely fail before the the tire would actually fail just from over inflation so I wouldn't so much worry about as the temperature starts to go up and your psi starts to go up because the the tire can handle it assuming there's no internal damage to the tire so where do you get weight at each tire position well the escapees group has something called smart way you can often find these at RV rallies they'll often have weighing sessions going on are also the RVs EF the safety education foundation oftentimes they'll be it at RV rallies the escapees group smartly actually has permanent locations you just go to escapees calm look up smart way and you can find their permanent locations and these groups are the ones that will actually weigh you at tire position and that way when you leave that session you'll know what your tire pressure should be in each tire so what about the cat scales at travel centers well a lot of times the cat scales will weigh you by axle and then some of them that I've seen or just one pad that you drive on and it just weighs the entire RV or truck and so if there's if you have nothing else then that's better than nothing you're not going to get that complete accuracy that you would by weighing at each tire position but it will tell you a lot about just being overweight in general if you were overweight from a gross vehicle standpoint so if you don't have time or you're not in a location where you can get weighed at by tire position and sure go to the cat scales and at least go ahead and get an idea of what your overall RV weighs so I hope this has been helpful and I hope that it helps you in determining what your proper tire pressure should be in your in your RV or your truck", "snippet": {"publishedAt":

507 color monitor in this video I'm going to show you how to set your psi and temperature alarm parameters into the monitor we're gonna set parameters here for our high and low pressure alarm and our high temperature alarm and as you can see right now I don't have any sensors programmed into my monitor so if you've just got in the system you can program your sensors in first and then set parameters or you can set parameters first so let's go ahead and set them the parameters in order to set these the first thing you're gonna need to do is get into programming mode in order to do that you just press and hold the set button until you hear a beep and we're in programming mode now and down at the bottom of the screen flashing will be the particular mode of programming that you're in and this is high pressure set if you want to scroll through the different programming modes you just use the plus and minus keys so if I hit plus and goes to low pressure set so we do want to go ahead and set our or low and high pressures here and and I like to set my low pressure first so in order to do that when you're on low pressure set you'll just tap the set button and this is done by axial so you need to know which axial you're planning on programming your sensors here but let's say I've got sensors on this front axle here and the recommendation is that you program your low pressure at about 10% below what your cold tire pressure should be so in this case let's say my cold tire pressure is a hundred psi so 90 psi would be where I would want my low pressure now if I want to adjust that I just use the plus and minus keys now once I'm done with this particular axle to move axles I'm going to tap the Go button so let's say I have installed some sensors on this axle or I'm going to install some miss axle and let's say that I'm still at 100 psi on that axle again it's already at 90 that's where I want it but if I want to move it I can always go in and and change it with the plus/minus keys now let's go ahead and move the axle positions back by tapping the Go button and you'll notice when you get to the to the back sensors here they all start blinking this would be say a travel trailer fifth wheel or even a tow vehicle for your RV and presumably all of those will have the same pressure tires so you would set them all at the same time now once you're done setting your low-pressure you need to tap the set button to save what you've done so I'm gonna tap the set button and it takes me out to the original screen what we call programming mode now I want to set my high-pressure set so I need to press my minus button to go back to high pressure set tap the set button to enter into high pressure set and now it's kind of the same thing the the front axle is blinking here I can make adjustments here say I was at a hundred psi maybe I would set this at a again it needs to be about 20 to 25 percent above what your cold tire pressure should be on the high pressure set so you know if I wanted to run it up to 125 psi right here that's perfectly fine and then you can tap the Go button to move to the next axle of where those sensors will be and then you can make adjustments again with the plus and minus button save it when you're done you have to press the set button or it won't save it so press the set button takes you back out to programming mode now we're going to set our temperature this is the alarm that will go off if you get above a certain temperature to find that particular programming mode start tapping your plus button until you see high temp set when you see high temp set tap the set button now it's set at 158 degrees this is customary in the the TST recommendation you certainly can adjust this if you like with the plus and minus buttons over here I've always left mine on 158 degrees and haven't haven't run into any issues with that so if you want to change it you can if not then again to save whatever you've done here you have to tap the set button and one more thing I want to point out this 158 degrees this is is you're not doing this by axle this is just all of the the sensors will be set at this so to save it you just tap the set button and again to just exit and get back out into drive mode you just tap the back button this takes you out to drive mode and all of those parameters are now set and then of course you'll need to go program your sensors in or maybe you've already done that ahead of time but that is how you set your high and low pressure alarm parameters and your high temperature alarm parameter for the TST 507 color monitor", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2018-07-09T16:36:20Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "TechnoRV TST 507 Learning Series: Setting up PSI and

{"id": "8qTMpc9aTa0", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "aWOx9YDeHtB-oLYCXJIjCaiE3AY", "transcript": "hey this is Eric with techno RV and today I want to talk to you about the new surge guard 34 950 and do some comparisons with the progressive PT models now this is the PT 50 C there is a newer addition PT 50x out they've changed a little bit of the housing the protection levels are the same as the PT 50 C and mainly we'll be talking about those protection levels first thing that I want to point out on these is that they they both analyze the pedestal power that means when you plug them in flip the breaker they're going to analyze to make sure that there's no open neutral conditions no open ground conditions no reverse polarity issues make sure the high and low voltage is within a certain range the difference on the analysis is is that the progressive takes two minutes and 16 seconds they actually post it right here on the side two minutes and 16 seconds for it to do that analysis and the surge guard takes ten seconds so it's pretty big deal as an RVer as you're hooking up your RV waiting that amount of time 10 seconds is really nice the other differences in these models from a protection standpoint is actually pretty huge both of them do what's called line side protection so from the pedestal to the RV the protection pretty much stops at the pedestal load side protection the surge guard 34 950 is the only one that has it this means that it can detect open neutral conditions within your RV it can also detect elevated ground conditions from inside of your RV and that's a big deal the progressive will not do that it only does line side protection so if you want line side and load side protection you got to get to 34 950 from surge guard now why would some of these conditions exist like maybe open neutral or ground related conditions you could lose a neutral at the at the cord Rio you could have poor connections at the junction box poor connections between your Shore power and the inlet poor connection at the transfer switch or even the main breaker box so poor connection can be an issue for our viewers because we're the RV or of the RVs vibrate a lot going down the road we're banging through rough roads and overtime things have a tendency to kind of loosen up including electrical connections so the surge guard will kind of pick that up if you have any of those conditions within your RV let's just talk about surge itself like a surge condition the the progressive has a surge protection rating at three thousand five hundred and eighty joules the thirty four 950 has a joules protection of forty two hundred so it's considerably different the surge guard has more protection from a surge standpoint the they both have the locking ring just for a little anti-theft measure they both have that so that you can take a cable lock or a chain or something like that and actually lock these units to the RV pedestal to prevent that theft and then from a warranty standpoint progressive as customarily had one of the better warranties on the market with a lifetime warranty but now surge guard actually has the best warranty on the market it's got not only a lifetime warranty but it also has connected equipment coverage which progressive does not have what connected equipment coverage is this means that if the surge guard unit fails and because of that failure something in your RV gets damaged surge guard the company will pay for that damage so that's a pretty big deal there they're that confident in their unit that it's going to protect your RV from these conditions another difference in these units is actually the the displace the surge guard has a LCD dual line display so it's easy to read it gives you your line 1 and line 2 voltage on the on the same screen it's also going to tell you your voltage and your amps that you're drawing from each line the progressive the screen on it's quite honestly it's just not as good looks like maybe a old pac-man display or something but the it's just not as good and also it does give you your line 1 line 2 voltage and how many amps you're drawing off of each line so that's good the other thing is that with the surge guard if there is a fault of some kind let's say you don't have a you have an open ground situation the surge guard just plainly says in the display that you've got open ground with the progressive it flashes codes to you there's a there's a code reading on the on the front of the unit here for progressive so if it flashed say an e 2 that would mean you have a open ground where this one will just say open ground so we've heard of people having these fade out and not really being able to read the codes if it's still there then obviously you could easily just see what the code is but I much prefer just to have the unit just tell me what it is so the comparison between surge guard and progressive has always been a kind of a touchy subject amongst our viewers it's almost like a Ford versus Chevy type thing I'm a full-time RVer I've used both and as the owner of Technol RV I only sell one solution for a particular issue and so I choose sides in this case the the surge card if you just look at the facts and the specifications on the coverage that it provides with now it has the load side per debt protection which the progressive doesn't have and it has better line side protection it has a better surge protection as well and it has a better warranty with the connected equipment coverage and the lifetime warranty so I wanted to point all those

{"id": "O5StWDSur_c", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "tM-p2LkQdDEYp_Uhg7J1NAEaQjA", "transcript": "hey this is Eric with techno RV and today I want to talk to you about the berkey water purification system and how it works first of all as a full time RV we travel all over the United States and the we just never know what kind of water we're going to get whenever we pull into a RV park or wherever we happen to be for the night and with the Berkey filter system we always know we're going to have good drinking water it's the water that we use to cook with and of course our dog Lincoln drinks nothing but murky water this may also means no more bottled water pretty important for an RV or just from a space and weight issue we used to carry a lot of bottled water around and now we carry no bottled water around and from a cost perspective I can filter a gallon of water through here for about two cents as opposed to bottled water that's about a dollar fifty a gallon so the Berkey is a gravity-fed system and what this means is that you don't need water pressure you don't need electricity and you don't need any special plumbing or anything like this is my unit right here and as you can see it's just a self-sufficient unit it's got an upper chamber here and this is where I would put water in and then it would filter the water down into the lower chamber and and then I would just get the water through the spigot here at the bottom so each Berkey system comes with the upper and lower chamber it also comes with two black Berkey filters the black murky filters who is what goes in the upper chamber here and then you can add on if you want to fluoride and arsenic filters and then those are attached to the bottom of the black filters in the lower chamber here the Berkey system is the most powerful gravity-fed water filtration system on the market we have inline water filter on our RV I know a lot of our viewers do some our viewers will buy an inline type unit to attach to the spigot coming into the RV as well these are usually usually have high micron ratings designed to just keep out larger particulate the Berkey system is going to eliminate bacteria viruses chemical contaminants and any foul tasting odors that you may get and it's going to do all this all while leaving in the beneficial minerals that you want in your water i can literally put dirty pond water into the upper chamber of the Berkey and have clean drinking water out of the lower chamber of the Berkey and that's why the Berkey is chosen by organizations like the Red Cross to go into like emergency areas that don't have clean drinking water and now you can have that right in your RV like we do so we're going to start digging into the box of the travel Berkey here and the travel Berkey is actually what we use and we chose the travel Berkey just because of the height of it it's 18 inches without the knob on top of the lid here we don't keep the novel in there because our cabinets are about 18 and 3/4 so 18 inches was perfect for us the the big berkey is about 19 and a quarter inches so just keep that in mind whenever you're placing your order on which one would be best for you based on where you want to place it in the RV so you'll notice that this is the box for the travel Berkey and you'll notice it's not even as tall as the Berkey itself and that is because the upper chamber actually nests into the lower chamber and a lot of people while they're traveling will just actually nest the upper chamber into the lower chamber now we don't do that we've been on some of the worst roads in America and we've never had our Berkey move it's got a nice rubber grip on the bottom but you can nest them while you travel if you want to so this is the travel Berkey box and when you open it it's nicely packaged this is the obviously the lid that that comes with it and then you've got basically your two units here and I'm just going to pull them out here so that you can kind of see what you're looking at it's got some instructions here but keep in mind when you get your unit from techno RV we're going to send you the learning series so we've got some nice videos that completely shows you all of the installation by video on this unit here so these are the upper and lower chambers here and I'm just going to go ahead and pull this is the upper chamber that I'm going to pull out of the lower chamber so that would be the lower chamber and then if I turn this over this is where the rest of the goodies are and what you've got here is every unit comes with two black or key filters now this is very important we only sell the Berkey with the black murky filters because that's the top-of-the-line you'll find people online that are selling burr keys with the white filters and while they're cheaper they're not as good so when you get them from techno RV you're gonna get the best and that is the black filter the black filter also filters 3000 gallons per filter and so with two filters in there you're going to get 6000 gallons of filtration I mean for us that could be like six seven years when you do the math on it from time to time you may have to take a scotch brite pad and just wipe down the the filters but other than that they're good for a very long time so there's your black filters also in the kit you are going to get the knob that goes on top of the lid if you want to install that and then you're also going to get the spigot which is of course what where you get your water at now I have a sight glass spigot right here which is an add-on out of the box you only get just the spigot but you can see on our site if you want the glass spigot then you can absol get that as well installation is super easy we give you all the instructions that you need to install this but I just wanted to show you real briefly kind of what it looks like out of the box so let me show you real quick just what the black murky filters look like we'll just go ahead and open this box this is the black Berkey filter comes with a rubber washer here and the wing nut so this is going to go in your top chamber and they'll just sit inside of your chamber and it'll connect to the top changer chamber with the the wing nut now you do have to purge these these black filters whenever you get them and every kit comes with a purging button that basically just allows you to there's my purging button it basically just allows you to purge them by placing this on the end of the black filter and then pushing it up against a faucet and forcing water through the pores of the black filter it's not hard to do you get this kit you're up and running and I would say 15 to 20 minutes easy so here's some advantages for the Berkey for specifically for an RVer first of all you can set this anywhere in your RV if there's a little table you have by a couch you want to set it on if you want to set it on your kitchen counter doesn't matter because it's gravity-fed it's a standalone unit the other thing already mentioned it no more bottled water so that's kind of a big deal when conserving water off the grid it's a great thing to have as well we've been in many places where we have not had water hookup and we've been trying to conserve water in our freshwater tank so as long as I can find a spigot somewhere in the area to go get some water and then just pour into my Berkey I've got clean drinking water it's the best tasting water you'll you'll get anywhere no matter where you're at in in in extreme situations where there's no water available again you can use the Berkey with any water really I mean if you had a pond you could get water not that you'll be doing that all the time but you know it's there if you would happen to need that the cost per gallon is very low as well so you can get these at techno or v.com and the reason you get these from us is we're full-time our viewers we use it we're very knowledgeable with them we always send you our learning series to make sure you're successful in setting this up and we're always available for you to call us and ask questions email and we also have live chat on our site as well so there's a

surge guard thirty-four nine fifty total electrical protection system so I just want to start out by telling you in general what a total electrical protection system will do for your 50 amp RV what you would do is you would plug this unit into the electrical pedestal at the RV park and then you would plug your cable from your RV into the unit and so any power that goes into your RV has to go through this unit right here so what happens is when you connect these two points and then flip the breaker on you're on the pedestal this unit goes through an analysis of the pedestal to make sure it's got a proper ground a proper neutral that there's no reverse polarity issues and that at that moment there's no high or low voltage issues if it sees that everything is good then it'll move power right on to your RV so after the power is crossed over to your RV then this units gonna protect you against surges and high and low voltage so anything above a hundred and thirty two volts or below a hundred and three volts this unit will cut you off from that because anything outside of that range would not be safe voltage for the electronic components in your RV so this unit will type make sure you're taken care of a few unique features about this unit is that this unit does the analysis of the pedestal in ten seconds so other units on the market the closest competitor takes about one hundred and thirty six seconds this one does it in ten seconds so it's a pretty big deal when you're setting up at an RV park to know that you've pretty much got power almost instantly when you plug this unit in now if this unit were to cut your RV off from power at any point due to some kind of incident then it does take into consideration that the AC unit on your RV likely has a two minute reset so in that case go through 128 second cycle to give the AC time to go through it's reset but upon initial setup you're looking at about 10 seconds the other unique feature about this unit we've already talked about the line side protection that's the from the pedestal into your RV and the protection that it gives to you for that now this is the only unit on the market that also gives you load side protection so what that means is is that this can detect if there's any open neutral situations going on inside of your RV it can also detect elevated ground currents within your RV so that would be considered load side protection so on the elevated ground current if you have 30 volts or above on the ground line this unit will be able to detect that and cut it off obviously would not be a safe situation and this unit would protect you from that also this unit comes with a nice locking ring here so that you can use a cable lock or a chain and lock to lock this to the pedestal to prevent theft so that's a kind of a nice feature there as well you get a dual line display here so and it's an LCD display so it's very easy to read and you're going to get your line 1 and line 2 voltage on the display and how many amps you're drawing from each line and then if you have some kind of fault say you had an open neutral situation then it would just read right here and just say you know open neutral so it makes it very easy for you from that respect it's also got the highest level of surge protection than any unit on the market it gives you forty two hundred joules of protection for your RV against surge the closest competitor is three thousand five hundred and eighty again this one gives you forty two hundred joules of protection so that's a lot of protection it is weather resistant I you I'm a full time RV or I use this 365 days a year I've never had any issues with you know rain snow whatever the weather is it's fine it's just not recommended that you if you've had a low pedestal or something you would want to raise it up off the ground somehow so it's not just laying in water so very weather resistant surge guard is owned by Southwire Southwire is the largest manufacturer of electrical cabling in North America so all of the cabling on this unit and including the head here with the t-handle all that is Southwire equipment so you know it's high quality because most people if you know anything about the electrical industry you know south wire is one of the top companies this unit has a lifetime warranty on it and what makes it really the best warranty on the market is not only do you get a lifetime warranty on it but you also get connected coverage warranty now what this means is is if this unit fails to do what it's intended to do and because it fails something in your RV gets damaged surge guard will take care of the cost of whatever that was so very confident in this unit and the best warranty on the market for the surge guard 34 954 50 amp RVs and you can get these units from techno RV comm", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2018-03-14T00:48:31Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "Surge Guard 34950 Total

surge guard 34 930 electrical protection system it's a total electrical protection system for 30 amp RVs so first thing I want to do is just tell you a little bit of how these units work you're gonna plug this into the pedestal the 30 amp pedestal and then you're just going to plug your cord from your RV into here so the power will have to come through this unit in order to get to your RV so once you flip the breaker switch this is going to analyze the pedestal to make sure you've got a proper ground a proper neutral no reverse polarity issues make sure that there's no high or low voltage issues at the time if there are no issues then it'll send the power on over into your RV from there it's going to protect you against surges and it's also going to protect you against high and low voltage so anything above 132 volts or below a hundred and three volts it would cut you off from that because that wouldn't be in a safe range for the electronic components in your RV now I want to talk specifically about some unique features of this unit and that is that this analysis that it does on the pedestal when you flip the breaker it does it in ten seconds now the closest competitor that does it in about 136 seconds so that's a pretty big deal when you get to an RV park and you're setting up ten seconds you've got your power over to you really really quickly the other question that we get on this is if you if this unit cuts you off from power at some point because of an issue would it take into account the air conditioner reset and an air conditioner reset can take about a couple of minutes so it does take that into consideration so if you get cut off from power and it's reanalyzing the pedestal then it'll go through 128 second cycle to account for the air conditioner reset the other thing that this unit does is not only does it protect you on the line side that's the power coming from the pedis but it also has the capability to protect you on the load side or the RV side as well what this means for this 30 amp unit is that it can detect elevated ground current so what this means is if this unit detects 30 volts or more within your RV on the ground then it's going to cut you off from that because that just would not be a safe condition so that's something unique that this system does that none of the competitors can do and the other thing that this unit the surge guard is done with this unit is they've increased the the brass thickness on the receptacle side of this unit so that's going to give you a better connection and it's going to reduce heat on from the plug to the unit you've got this nice locking ring here this will make sure that you have something that you can lock this unit to the pedestal with so I really like that the other thing is it's got an LCD display here and the LCD display is going to first of all it will show you your countdown on your 10 seconds whenever you turn it on it's also going to show you how many volts are coming in on that line and how many amps that your RV is drawing from that line once you get up and run it so that's nice to have a nice LCD display there in addition it is a surge protector as well and the 34 930 gives you two thousand four hundred fifty joules of surge protection it is the highest level of surge protection that you can get in any unit on market the closest competitor is 1790 joules so at twenty four fifty that's a that's going to give you a lot of protection against against surges this unit is weatherproof so I'm a full time RV and so I have my surge guard plugged in 365 days a year and never have any issues with rain or any kind of storms or anything like that you just don't want to leave this like laying in a puddle or something like that I wouldn't good for it also surge guard is owned by Southwire they're the largest manufacturer of electrical cabling in North America so all of this cabling that you see here on the unit and even even this part right here is all Southwire made so you know it's going to be good quality this unit comes with a lifetime warranty and what makes it the best warranty on the market not only that its lifetime warranty but it also gives you connected equipment coverage that means that if this unit fails and doesn't do what it's intended to do and something in your RV gets damaged because of its failure then surge guard will pay the cost of whatever got damaged so it's a very strong warranty that they have on this unit right here and and you can get this unit the surge guard 34 9:30 at techno RV calm", "snippet":

{"id": "D-9lnBGQNhA", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "YmA4KBZLepy0xfdyLsNcgvXD-MY", "transcript": "hey this is Eric with techno RV and today I want to introduce you to the newest version of the surge guard portable total electrical protection system with a release date of February 2018 this model right here is the 34 950 this would be for 50 amp RVs and this model right here would be the 34 930 surge guard for 30 amp models so let's start out by talking about exactly what a total electrical protection system is and what all these units can do for your RV to protect you from bad power this right here is the previous model thirty-four 850 and then this is the new thirty-four 950 so I just wanted to kind of show you visually the differences in this in that the newer unit is much shorter and it doesn't have the the pigtail off the bottom they've built the receptacle into the housing itself but there's a lot of changes from a protection standpoint from the 34 850 to the 34 950 that I want to make sure you get in this video so let's start off just by talking about what a total electrical protection system is so a total electrical protection system has always been line side protection which means that power coming from the pedestal into your RV so again either a 30 amp model or a 50 amp model what they will do is when you plug these into the pedestal and then plug your rv's cord into this unit flip the breaker on the pedestal this will immediately start analyzing the pedestal and making sure it's got a good ground that there's no open ground situations no open neutral situations no reverse polarity issues there's no current high or low voltage issues at the time and if there are no conditions that exist then it will swap the power over to your RV now here's one of the big changes that surge guard made with this model as far as that analysis is concerned if you had the older model or if you even had another brand of total electrical protection system you know that these the process from when you flip that breaker and this is analyzing the pedestal can take 128 seconds some units take up to 136 seconds this units doing it in 10 seconds now and I'm telling you it's quick it may not seem like a big deal but when you're setting up and you want to get power to your RV 10 seconds is very quick and I'll show you that here in just a little bit now for the added protection that 34 950 gives you that no other unit on the market any brand doesn't matter cannot do and this is a really big deal for this new model again line side protection most units on the market protect you from that pedestal to the RV none of them protect you on the load side which is from the RV side the new 34 950 will now be able to detect on 50 amp models open neutral conditions inside of the RV so if it detects an open neutral situation in your RV it's going to cut you off from that also on the load side it's going to be able to detect elevated ground current inside the RV so if you have that condition it'll be able to know it so what are some things that that could potentially cause this you could have a loose connection in your cord reel you could have a poor connection your junk junction box or a poor connection between your Shore power and the inlet poor connection at your transfer switch or even at your main breaker box these can be common issues in RVs considering the vibration and and nuts kind of banging down the roads with our our RVs travel trailers fifth wheels whatever you have these can be issues that'll occur so again the new surge guard will protect you not only from line side which a lot of units will do but it's the only system on the market now that will protect you on the load side as well from open neutral and elevated ground conditions and that is a really big deal for this unit as far as surge protection is concerned this unit has the highest level of surge protection any unit on the market with 4,200 joules of protection the previous model 34 950 had three thousand eight hundred fifty joules of protection its closest competitor is progressive at three thousand five hundred and eighty jewels of protection this one has forty two hundred joules of protection so from a surge protection standpoint the best unit on the market it's also now got the locking ring on it which I like because now from a theft perspective when I plug this into the pedestal I can just run a cable lock through this and around the pedestal or you can just take a chain wrap it around it and put the lock straight through the locking ring so makes it a little easier than the way it was designed on the previous model in addition from a warranty standpoint surge guard now has the best warranty on the market of any electrical protection system they have lifetime warranty and in addition they added connected equipment coverage and that's the part of it that makes it the best warranty on the market so the connected equipment coverage means that if this unit fails and something in your RV gets damaged then that connected equipment coverage will cover the damage so it's complete confidence from surge guard that their unit is going to do absolutely what it says it will do and protect your RV from these conditions and so again best warranty in the market lifetime and connected equipment coverage from the surge guard the 34 950 and the 34 930 all right we're at a pedestal and I've got the previous model of thirty-four 850 and my breakers are turned off here so I just wanted to show you how quickly the analysis is on the the new model versus the old model so if I plug my thirty-four 850 into the pedestal flip my breaker it'll start running the analysis on the pedestal it starts to do a count up to 128 seconds and again it's analyzing the pedestal for open ground open neutral make sure it doesn't have those conditions reverse polarity proper low and high voltage or to make sure you don't have any lower high voltage issues and I'm not going to sit here and wait the entire 128 seconds but I can tell you we're at 27 seconds right now and I want to show you how quickly the new unit does this I'm going to go ahead and turn the breaker off take this unit out of the pedestal take the new 34 950 plug it into the pedestal now listen for the thunk whenever I turn the breaker on it's only going to take 10 seconds turned it on it's counting now down from 10 seconds 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 and it just turned my power on that quick I would have power to my RV so a massive improvement over the previous model and really over any other model on the market because other models actually take longer than 128 seconds to do this also keep in mind that the surge yard is owned by Southwire they're the largest manufacturer of electrical cabling in North America so this cabling is Southwire cabling and the design on this plug is Southwire too and it's got these handy I guess a cool mechanism to make it easy to unplug so if I turn the breaker off it just makes it easy for me to unplug this unit from the pedestal the 34 930 works the same way 10 seconds analyze the pedestal crosses power back to your RV a few more things that I want to point out these units are total electrical protection systems you can go by just kind of a cheaper just surge guard that'll only protect you from surges that is not what you will experience most as an RVer usually it's low-voltage type issues or issues from the load side within your RV and these units are the only system on the market that'll protect you from that those load side conditions in addition you always want to match the unit for your particular RV so if you've got a 50 amp RV get the 50 amp model same for the 30 amp and then you can adapt from there so if you're in a 50 amp RV and you've got the 50 amp unit pull into an RV park and all they have is 30 amp then as long as you have a proper adapter then this will still work from you for you you can get these at techno RV comm or full-time RVs we only sell units that we use full-time on the road we work very closely with surge guard we were the first RV years to get these to help test these

communicating with and it comes with a 5 DB gain antenna and that's what you're hearing the signal coming back to you from the access point it also comes with this window mount that it's like a little cradle that the desktop booster just pops into right there line of sights very important for Wi-Fi so this cradle is good because you can comes with a suction couple the back of it you can put this in a window facing the direction of the access point and gives you better line-of-sight by having the ability to do that has this cable here that then connects to the next component that comes with this kit is the r-36 repeater this is an important component because this is what's going to rebroadcast the boosted signal within your RV this is what you're going to connect to wirelessly from all of your devices whether it's a smartphone or some kind of tablet computers whatever it is you're going to wirelessly connect to this unit here and by doing that you'll be getting the boosted signal from this unit here so it's a really nice setup in addition it comes with a AC power supply just like a wall outlet regular wall outlet power supply we also include the 12-volt pass cigarette lighter style power supply as well if you have a use for that it comes with the kit and here's kind of what makes this kit extra special and that is that we we throw in the long range yagi antenna I know this thing may look a little bit scary but here's what this is this is a a 16 DB gain directional and 10 okay comes with about a 3-foot pigtail cable here and then in the kit we also include a 16 foot low loss cable that you can then attach to the yaga to get some extension from here here's what you do with this again it's a directional antenna which means that the end of this antenna needs to be pointing towards the access point wherever your signals coming from so you need to know where the access point is you've got about 10 to 12 degrees to work with there if you don't know where the access point is then the the yagi antenna is not going to do you much good because you're just going to be guessing but what you do with this kit is let's say you get somewhere and you set up the desk top booster and the repeater and let's just say in this particular scenario this just isn't quite enough it's really just not enough to bring in maybe the distance is really a long ways off or there's just something that's that's not giving you quite what you need you can unscrew this antenna that's 5 DB gain antenna from the desk top booster now this still leaves you your 2 watt transmitter remember that's what sends the signal out and then what you're going to do is you're going to take your 16 foot low loss cable you're going to connect that to your desktop booster okay and then the other end of the low loss cable is going to connect to the Aggie antenna this way you can run this outside all right and then really start to work with where's that signal coming from and this is really a long range solution you know we're talking about up to a mile if conditions are good there's a lot of different things that can affect a Wi-Fi signal so if you're having a foggy morning that can affect Wi-Fi signal source obstructions in the way that can affect Wi-Fi signal so there's no guarantees with these things if you had perfect conditions this could certainly pull something in up to a mile but that's how it works it's it's a it's an add-on to our desktop Booster kit it really gives you the ability that if you get somewhere and that desktop booster kit just didn't quite doing that you've got another tool in the toolbox to really get out there and grab that signal and it's very very effective very effective keep in mind that that when you order from techno RV you get our learning series and this is a email that you'll get from us that we put together complete instructions on how to how to set these kits up come complete with pictures and video of us setting the system up and we want you to be successful with this we're also available by phone if you need support and so we're in this with you if you have any issues with anything from this kit here you just give us a call and we'll make sure we get you headed in the right direction with that so there you have it that's the desktop booster with long-range Wragge antenna kit and you can only get this particular kit

{"id": "UqseVd85SyY", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "glYDlahFziOUqaI8AKPH0kZtbno", "transcript": "[Music] hey this is Eric with techno RV and today I want to talk about the weeb Boost 4gx RV cellular booster it's the newest lineup in the wee boo cellular boosting products and it's designed specifically for rvers uh there's three kits out right now that are all based around the 4gx platform uh or amplifier that weeb boost has there's just the regular 4gx kit and that comes with this amplifier uh it comes with a mini magnetic Mount antenna for the outside and then for the inside it comes with a chocolate bar style uh inside antenna this is what's going to re broadcast the boosted signal within your RV the other kit that is based around the 4gx is the 4gx OTR kit and that's this amplifier and then you get a a trucker antenna uh and then you still get uh the chocolate bar style antenna for the inside both of those kits the 4gx kit and the 4G XR kit both come with a DC power supply uh so that's kind of what exists right now the latest model to hit the market Market is the 4gx RV and that's what we're going to talk about today all right this is the box that the 4gx RV comes in and uh I really like the way they did this I've already unboxed everything out of it by the way uh but when you open your kit it actually has a box a and a box B in it and then within those boxes you get more boxes that have the contents of the kit but they're listed very plainly that this box is for step one and this box is for step two three six and eight and uh then there's a four and a five and a seven box so they really make it easy as far as installation to say hey start here and uh and the directions are are really good with this as well so let's take a look at what comes in the 4gx RV model again we've already talked about the main source for the amplification comes from the 4G uh xplatform by we boost this system is a 50 DB gain model it's the most allowable boost uh that the FCC will allow in a uh unit like this this designed that can be used in motion uh you've got a very strong antenna you've got a very strong transmitter and uh so everything you need to boost Bo your cellular uh signal in your RV is going to be in this kit so again you get the 4gx amplifier your outside antenna is an omnidirectional uh antenna and it comes with a ubolt and a bracket that you can see here that is designed uh to fit presumably on like a ladder rack uh or maybe you have an extendable Pole uh that you put on your ladder rack um it's also a great solution that would work with the Techno RV uh antenna suction cut mount with a PVC pole in it uh so we'll show that a little bit later on as well but that is what the antenna looks like it's very small in stature and uh so hopefully won't create a new high point on your RV and uh very powerful so there's your outside antenna you get 20 ft of RG6 cable so this is going to run from the outside antenna inside of your RV 20 ft of RG6 cable now this kit comes with uh directions on how to permanently Mount this if you want to do that complete with uh you know the size bit you need to drill a hole um it also comes with uh these these mounting tabs for your additional wiring that may be on the outside of your RV with zip ties and and uh it even comes with a a stopper where you drilled your hole that you would put this in and then the cable would just come uh out of that to keep it weatherproof so it comes with all that if you want to do a permanent install if you don't want to do a permanent install then again you look at the uh the suction cup antenna mount that we have so that covers the outside antenna your 20 ft of RG6 cable and then you're going to have an inside antenna I thought this was a nice addition for the RV model it comes with the desktop booster this now is what's going to rebroadcast your boosted signal within your RV so this tends to project further than the little chocolate bar style uh inside antennas so I really like the addition of that and as far as power supplies the other addition that I like if you'll remember with the 4gx kit and the OTR kit it only came with a DC power supply this kit comes with an AC power supply just a regular wall plug and it also comes with a DC power supply they give you open leads lead ends um it's a fused uh 12 volt hardwire power supply so if you wanted to do that you've got that option um to do that so that is everything that comes in the kit outside antenna cable your desktop boot booster for inside your 4gx amplifier and your power supplies uh some other goodies here for uh mounting and some great instructions that come with this it's the we boost 4gx RV and now let's take a look uh outside at some different mounting options for this kit all right we're outside of my RV and I want to show you two mounting options for the 4gx RV and one is using the Techno RV antenna suction cup mount and I've got a whole separate video on how the suction cup mount works so if you want to check that out you can look there this is already installed so what I've got is the Techno RV antenna suction cut mount with a 1 in by 5T schedule 40 PVC pole and then if you'll notice on the top I've already got mounted the antenna that comes with the 4gx RV kit and I used the mounting bracket that came with it and then you've got the RG 6K if you'll notice I ran it down it's on the inside of this gasket right here if you'll follow it down I left some excess here but but basically right here is where it enters into the RV so uh the next time that I do this I'll obviously run this inside so it won't uh have the excess sitting here and so it's a real clean install because you can put it on the inside of the gasket here and kind of hide the cable okay so there's one option to mount the uh the 4gx RV antenna is with the Techno RV antenna suction cup mount Works real good so here's your other option you can mount the antenna directly to if you have a ladder rack and uh the bracket fits onto the ladder rack and then of course you've got 20 ft of RG6 cable this has got to go inside so if you're going to do a permanent install and you're going to need to drill a hole so if this was me and and my RV I would just run this along the roof find me an entry point into a cabinet and uh drill in um I choose not to do that I choose to set mine up temporarily with the antenna suction cut Mount but if you want to do it permanently you could certainly do it and this is a solution for that right here so other options to mount this uh some people get an extendable pole and attach it to their ladder wrap and then have this attached to the extendable Pole to where they can raise it up uh other options might be if you have a uh like a Batwing antenna on your RV and you can figure out a way to to attach this to it that may work as well well also uh the only issue with that though is when the Batwing antenna is down uh you wouldn't be able to use this in motion because this wouldn't be vertical uh so you can get creative with it and figure out what works for your own RV but there's a few ideas for you so there you have it it's the wee boost 4gx RV it's a 50db gain system which means you can increase your coverage by up to 32 times so we talked about the different kits that have the different antennas and and power supplies and that's really what you have to decide on which one's best for you I think the RV models got a lot covered uh but keep in mind that you can add to these kits as well so uh if you bought this RV model and then you wanted to figure out how maybe you could transition this to say your tow vehicle you can always add uh like the mini magnetic antenna to your order uh you can add the the uh inside antenna chocolate bar style antenna for your vehicle so there's a lot of different ways that you can do this and we're here to help you at techno RV so if you've got questions that you need assistance with uh determining which one's right for you or what you need you can email us at info techn rv.com you can also call us uh we'll put the number on the screen here we're happy to talk you through this decision uh techno RV we ship very fast we have all this in stock uh we do free shipping and uh we of great support we're always here to support our customers and uh so I hope this was

Alabama and we love our home area because of all the water we've got Mobile Bay we've got some of the most beautiful beaches and Gulf Shores and Orange Beach - we love it and we also love the weather because right now it's December the 7th and it's 65 degrees outside yeah shorts and t-shirt and so we wanted to show you one of the best RV resorts that we found in this area it's Bella Terra of Gulf Shores and it's in fully Alabama and and we just love it here so what are some of your favorite things about this resort I like the location that it's not right in the middle of the touristy Park of Gulf Shores but it's close enough that it's just a short drive I mean it's just a couple miles to get to target publics and restaurants and Beach and all that type stuff so you're not right in the middle of everything but the grounds are gorgeous I mean the landscape it's incredible the clubhouse and everything is quiet and just nice to relax it's really a good place to to treat yourself to just a nice RV Resort and also what we found is you can actually buy lots in here and create your own kitchen area in gazebo and casitas and all that kind of neat kind of thing and so we found that there's people here that just come for the wintertime and but the summers are great here too and we just want to show it all to you so again Bella Terra at gulf shores and foley alabama let's go take a look at it all right I like porch with big wide lanes to get to RV and when you pull in this has that you basically just pull up right to the office for check-in so that makes it real easy [Music] and here we are checking in come in we read it nicely and what I really liked about it was they actually take it sit you down talk to you about the park and where everything is located yeah I don't think that's ever happened before normally they just give you the booklet you leave and kind of on your own and when you're done in the office they just lead you right out to your spot so that makes it nice there's a lot of different lots to choose from there's some on the lake there's pull through 's so yeah you just get with the front office about that when you make your reservation and here's a lot right on the lake with a casino on and and a lot of these are lots are owned and then the office rents these out so a lot of them are appointed quite nicely with outside kitchens and casitas and things like that [Music] it also has a practice putting green and I think a bocce ball a little field you can kind of see all the different sights that are available on the math not all of them are built there are a few under construction so when you purchase one you kind of get to design it yourself what type of kitchen you want if you want to casita if you want a gazebo and they kind of let you really design it yeah and there's a laundry rooms at different areas there is a pet park and so you know it's kind of got all the things that you would expect out of a nice RV Resort and they really did a good job putting these together as far as not only the layout but kind of the niceties or the quality of workmanship of the buildings and things like that around the park yeah there are several different laundry stations with private bathrooms there even adding a dog wash which is really convenient especially for those with larger dogs but let's look at the clubhouse now it was just fabulous it's right when you kind of enter the park it's the first thing you see just the inside is really well appointed and well decorated [Music] all right we're in the military clubhouse now one of the best we've ever seen so we're gonna show you around and they've got a great fitness area that we discovered a few days into actually being here we were like what have we been thinking I mean look at everything not I mean the walk around Wow yeah everything the sauna massage table free weights it's got the universal weight machine yeah so the fitness area is top-notch I think it's incredible they've got this movie theater room it's like they got the stacked CD and the screen is on it's big as a bigger the whole wall and yeah and I know they have movie nights in there and then presume you can just bring your own movie up here anytime you want it's a great community they always something scheduled for you to today's poker night tonight yeah so and it's got this little Auraria it's got a nice kitchen area and then we looked at and it's got kind of everything you need to have a little party and it's at Amy's point they just kind of have parties anyway for the variety from time to time and outside the pool area is fabulous it's the infinity infinity infinity knows what it's called they have an outdoor grill the kitchen area a lot of seating so you can have your RV gotta be quiet when I said overlooking the lake so the pier is just gorgeous yeah so it all kind of makes sense you know and it's decorated for Christmas right now because it's like we said it's December so it's this is one of the best club houses that we've seen there's a lot of good ones out there and in this one this one ranks up there at the top level [Music] during our stay at Bella Terra we had an opportunity to actually visit their sister site reunion point it is an RV port home community where you can actually have your motor home in your home together and you share a courtyard I mean it's a motor home community and you basically build a house and they work with you to do this that incorporates your motorhome it's got full hookups obviously and it's just incorporated into the whole house you can open the house up directly the RV there's at outdoor kitchens that are right there in between basically your RV in the home you can get one or two bedrooms they really work with the customers they work with a builder at a Fairhope Alabama it really does great work yeah the neat thing I liked is that because they share the courtyard you really can kind of stay in the RV and let people stay in the house or stay in the house and let people stay in the RV and it's really just in the same common area because you share the courtyard there were so many different variations of the houses we saw because again you get to design your house as far as colors there were people that chose different bathroom types all the bathrooms were beautiful but there's just a lot of versatility as far as your cabinet color and everything you could choose to make it feel even more now yeah I mean they're called port homes and honestly I've just never seen anything like this before and I actually put in a search engine and this is the one that comes up so you know if you're looking for a home base in a great area of Baldwin County Alabama real right by the beaches and need a place for your motorhome and then you like to travel then your motorhomes always there yeah and I think they have a rental program for this as well where when you're not at your house you can actually rent your port home out all the times you travel yeah and they there's a lake there building a clubhouse and it's really just a great community or for motorhomes so you can contact them a reunion point is the name and they'll schedule you a tour talking about", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2017-02-07T03:23:35Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "Bella

{"id": "2yWQ_dIZ2oY", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "dlpOBGQgtufBH8-l4q5VT3GXChk", "transcript": "[Music] hey this is Eric with techno RV and this is our external Wi-Fi booster tube now one of the questions I get asked a lot about these is how to install them so you're usually just left with maybe installing them on your ladder rack or if you have one of the Batwing antennas you can put it on there uh but then you have a usually have a long run with the cable it comes with a 16t cable to get to the maybe the entry point of where you want it to enter your RV so uh we've come up with a solution for this we got with the uh the people over at ghost stick products and this is a heavyduty suction cup mount and we had them uh put an additional bracket on here and basically what you can do is you can install your antenna directly in these brackets and we'll just go ahead and do this real quick just run this through here just like that and then you can easily tighten these down just like this what this gives you the ability to do it gives you the ability to put your antenna right at your entry point on your RV and for me it's this slide out right here okay so what I've done is I've taken the cable and I've run it right inside of my slide okay so usually if you'll just run your slide in 3 or 4 in you'll start to see light uh and then you can run the slide in real easily so that's what I did I pulled my slide in ran the cable in and then I pull my slide back out and uh and then I just install this at the top of my slide out right here so I'm going to climb a ladder and show you what it looks like the install is super easy at this point all I want to do is now Mount this at the top of my slide and to do this I'm just going to take a damp cloth wipe the area that I want to put the Su cup wipe the suction cup with a damp cloth place it where I want it to be and then pull the handle in to activate the suction that is not going anywhere the other great thing is if you'll remember I installed this cable right inside my slide so now what I can do to make it a really clean install is I can just tuck this cable behind the gasket all the way down and you'll only see about maybe uh 6 in of the cable at that point uh so this would be very good if my access point that I was trying to reach with this antenna was maybe out in this direction here so it may not be as good as if if the access point was on the other side of my RV so you could do one of two things with that you could go and you could take this suction cut Mount and just go mount it on the other side of the RV if you knew that was the direction the access point was coming from or you can get some more extension uh on this antenna to get it higher in the air so I want to show you something that we recommend for people that they can do you can get a 1 INX 5 ft PVC pole then all you do is put the PVC pole in this bracket and then you mount your antenna on top of the PVC pole it's a great solution to make sure that you're getting good line of sight with your Wi-Fi and I'm going to go ahead and do that right now and show you what that looks like this is now the ultimate solution so we've got our suction cut Mount right here okay and instead of putting the antenna directly into the brackets got a one inch by 5 foot PVC Pole now I put this in the bracket and then I mount my antenna at the very top of that and I do that with a couple of zip ties and they actually come with that external booster tube kit and now my height is really good it's going to be great for my line of sight to the access point so now whether my access point is over here or on the other side of my RV my antenna is well above my RV and any other RV in the park so that's very important for line of sight as it relates to Wi-Fi also my install is very clean because I've mounted this so close to my uh entry point that uh you really can't even see the cable because I just tucked it in behind the gasket on the slide so that makes the install very clean and uh also this will work for any antenna out there uh we're talking about our external booster tube but if you got some other kind of antenna that you need to get some height on this will work for that as well and uh it's an exclusive you can only get it at techno RV so go to techno rv.com today and get you one so this is the way that I installed it uh with the slide out you know my entry points here and uh and then I just ran the cable behind this gasket all the way up and then popped it back out to uh catch the antenna up top so it's a real clean install that you know you don't have cables hanging all over the place and uh but if if you didn't have a uh a slide you can certainly go uh inside a window a lot of people do that uh you may have some other entry point so you can kind of get uh creative with this but this is something when you get to a park you need this system you can pop it up real quick run it in and then of course it's not made to to stay here while you're in motion so before you leave of course you need to take it back down and uh but anyway we're real proud of this product it's the uh it's the suction cup antenna mount you can get it at techn rv.com [Music]", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2016-10-31T03:21:40Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "Suction Cup Mount for RV WiFi or Cell Antenna",

{"id": "OgXui4pQ_fA", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "4BGvfKZJlj6eDkfZIduxe_77soI", "transcript": "hey this is Eric with techno RV and today I want to talk to you about the techno RV USB high-powered desktop Wi-Fi booster it's one of our more popular Wi-Fi boosting products and it's real easy to use I use it all the time with my work computer and as you can see I've got it mounted up here in the window and so let's just go ahead and take that down and talk a little bit about this unit so that you know what you're buying here so just visually if you just kind of look at this you know it's it's a teal in color that the older units used to be gray so if you've got a an older gray unit you know that you don't have the most updated unit and this one is actually more powerful in that older unit so keep that in mind but it's teal in color and uh it's not that big so it'll stay out of your way nicely and so you're looking at about two and a half inches from as far as a width here and then you're looking at about three and a half inches this way and then you know it's real thin you know problem maybe a half an inch or so like that got the 6 inch antenna on it I'm here to here and so it swivels and it also can just go straight out so as you saw ahead it on the window makes it easy to do that and it's got a little yellow or I'm sorry a blue LED light here on it that'll be flickering while you're using it to kind of let you know that it's transmitting okay from a power standpoint what you're getting here is this this unit as a 2 watt transmitter in it so you know accessing Wi-Fi is a kind of a two-way proposition here so you have to send your signal out to the access point and then they send a signal back so to send your signal out you need a transmitter to watt transmitter and and then to receive a signal you need an antenna and this is a six-inch antenna it's got a 5 DB gain rating on it so that's strong if we compare that to the internal Wi-Fi adapter and say your device is like a laptop or a smartphone tablet most of those have around 0.2 of a watt of power somewhere around there and so this is a full 2 watts so as you can see a lot more powerful to send your signal out and then the antennas that come in with like a smartphone or a laptop are usually about 1 DB gain and this one again it's 5 DB gain so you're really getting a lot of gain and if you think about it whenever you're using this with with say a laptop you're basically using this in the place of your internal Wi-Fi adapters basically what you're doing and really gives you a lot of games now comes with a 5 foot USB cable many - regular USB it is a 2.0 USB and I just plugs in real nicely there in the front here and then the other end will just plug into your your computer and so the supported systems for this is Windows operating systems that can also have a that also has a USB port so if you have a windows-based computer whether you're on 7 8 10 whatever it'll work for it and but you Mac users out there this will not work as a direct connect to a Mac computer you know obviously it won't work with like a you know a direct connect with a smartphone or a tablet because they don't even have a USB port on it so you'd be looking at if you have a laptop like me I use a Windows I'm on 8 right now Tim uses Windows 10 and so basically I just take my USB port or cable and plug it into the USB port on my computer and when you buy from techno RV we also include this window mount and so for here I couldn't it could just sit sit it here a lot of sites important so you kind of want to buy a window and in the direction of the access point but even better you can just pop this into the included window mount that we include and then you can just pop it on the window and and then just put the antenna straight up and down so works real nicely once you plug it in the setups easy a lot of computers will just recognize these boosters and mind it so I plugged it in I heard the power cycle and it just started working and all I had to do is turn off my internal adapter and make sure my computer knew to use this one so that makes it real easy there so if your computer doesn't recognize the desktop booster when you get it it's okay or this desktop booster supported by our learning series so we basically written our own instructions on how to kind of set this up and make it real easy on you we're always here supporting within those instructions as a driver that you would simply download you know that driver works all the way through Windows 10 and works backwards through the windows systems as well and so you could just do it easy installation of that driver and then when you plug the system in and it'll recognize it so the setups real easy and with our learning series that you get when you buy from techno RV it you'll be set up and running in just a matter of minutes and and then of course if you have any questions you can give us a call and we're always here to support you and so I really like this unit i Tami I'll tell you my computer it always has this plug in to it you know whether I'm connecting to an Access Point you know 100 yards away or whether I'm just connect being you know to a hot spot within you know a short distance I'm using it and if you are a Mac user or you need multiple devices to be connected to the boosted signal from the desktop booster you can add you can add our repeater that we sell at techno RV comm and then what you would do is instead of plugging this into a computer you would plug it into the repeater so we'll cover that in another video but there you have it that's the desktop booster from techno RV and you can get it at techno RV calm", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2016-08-10T20:41:41Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "An Easy Wi-Fi Boosting Solution for Your RV", "description": "Check out the Desktop WiFi Booster from TechnoRV at https://www.technorv.com/alfa-high-power-desktop-wifi-booster/\n\nWant an easy solution to boost the campground's Wi-Fi signal when you are in your RV?

{"id": "7AdtcMbmQNw", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "peHc4otcC5ls261StZQzqWRpWSs", "transcript": "hey this is Eric and Tammy with techno RV and we love the Smoky Mountains and uh recently we got to stay at the River Plantation RV Resort in Seville Tennessee and we liked it so much we thought we'd make this uh video here to kind of show you the park and actually recommend it to everyone yeah sometimes it's hard when you go online and you're booking you know where you're going to stay for a trip and you really don't really know what you're getting yourself into there may be a few pictures online of the resort but we we really wanted to give you a just a really in-depth view of what you get yourself into with River Plantation which we know you will enjoy um so you can kind of help make that decision Yep this park exceeded our expectations so uh let's take a look around all right here's what it looks like pulling into the park and as you can see it's a nice wide driveway uh something I really like in a park uh sometimes you pull into parks and the stress level can start to go up because you don't know what you're getting into if there's going to be some uh some tight Lanes but it's nice and wide and then they give you these nice three uh wide Lanes to pull into this a great place to disconnect tow vehicles and things like that put it in park and uh then you're off and running into the registration office yeah I really liked the registration office here because you can tell right off that the Landscaping everything's really done nicely but they really put some personal touches you don't feel like you're just walking into like a gas station like some you know registration offices are uh you can tell they've spent a lot of time it was very clean they offered all the things that you would need but also some just additional things that really made you feel just kind of cozy I absolutely loved the registration office yep and then uh over to the side of the registration office you have the uh the fitness room which we never used no we didn't but well we could have we could have but uh we didn't but a lot of universal weights here and and they have the uh the treadmills and all that good stuff and uh the bathroom in this area and they've got free weights TVs you know everything you would need for a gym uh and then outside they have this guys I guess it's a universal little fire pit and there's cabins off to the side and again you can see the Landscaping they really put a lot of pride in it it's really a pretty Place yeah so this is another view from the entrance as you can see they have a propane filling station and that big building in the back is a conference center great for RV rallies and then they have a a nice big swimming pool over here to the right yeah it wasn't clean by the time CU we went right at the beginning of the season but you can see the pictures online the pool's beautiful they have like a fountain hot tub all that kind of stuff so it was really nice there and then the uh the conference center we were actually here for a rally that's me actually doing a seminar there but it's really big and then this was just one side of the conference center right here so uh there we had a hundred or so rvers uh in the conference room and it's complete with uh it's got kitchen and and pretty much everything you would need for uh uh audio visual uh you know just whatever you need for a nice RV rally I would really recommend it for that yeah the the rally that we were um participating in were just amazed at that you had access to the commercial kitchen you could have events catered or you could actually cook yourself in there and it it was just um if you were thinking about a rally it was just a great addition covered air conditioned speakers you know everything they had even a band one night so it was really nice yeah so here's a look at uh some of the RV lots and you can see they're nice and wide and spacious they have a a concrete pad and the picnic tables uh the pedestals had good power I checked several of the pedestals and they had really good power and then uh full sewer water pressure was great and uh again you're not too close to your neighbors or anything and in the background there you can see the RV wash that they have so if you want to get your RV wash there they have that and then more cabins uh you know if you have uh relatives that are coming down to stay in the area that don't have RVs they can stay in these cabins or they're good for rallies as well one of my favorite things is that little river runs right along the the backside of the uh RV park so you have a lot of lots that are right there on the river I I like going for a walk over there are RV wasn't there but it was super nice to be able to go and see the water thing I liked was that every lot has their own fire pit actually on the lot built in so that was kind of a nice addition you know to have oh they had a great Pavilion here at the River Plantation uh lots of picnic tables in this area it's covered uh a grill pit and uh here's a big common area This Grass area over here it's got a big huge fire pit ring there and I know one night we probably had 30 people around that uh yeah if not more yeah was great everybody brought their own firewood it was really cool and it's very centrally located so you know it's right in the kind of the center so yeah you can see there's a stage at the front we saw RV rallies doing presentations and things here it was really nice yeah and then right in the middle of the whole place you got this little playground for kids basketball court and uh swing sets all kinds of things here yeah this is the main laundry and bath house it also has the arcade attached to it but this kind of has the largest um bath house and laundry area and I'm telling you the bath house was really nice it had several sinks but the coolest thing I liked was the showers were very private you not only had a large shower but as you can see they had of course the handicapped um shower but the other showers had this nice shower plus this dressing area all very private with the doors um I was really impressed very clean um just really liked the bath house bathrooms um the main one and as you can see the arcade I mentioned that was attached I mean it's got a lot of windows so you can kind of monitor the kids but maybe while you're doing laundry give the kids a few quarters let them go play um had a really neat arcade even for adults doesn't have to be a kid so that was another nice addition um on other parts of the site they had smaller bath houses and laundry um facilities and again still very clean not as private as the main one but very clean very nice um bath houses and the laundry area um again very well lit had of course the change and a good folding station which I liked and um place is just it was it was a great room yeah and here's a map of the site and uh you can get a copy of this map off River Plantation rv.com and uh you can see there's a lot of sites whether you got 30 amp 50 amp uh it's got you covered there and uh Mike Hae and their staff uh there at River Plantation RV Resort really did a great job making everybody feel welcome getting everybody checked in uh they seem to be processing people through very quickly and uh they just did a really great job and then here's a here's just what a magnificent view this is the the park kind of looking down into the park so you know you you you don't feel like you're like right in the middle of everything but uh you know it's got a severe veill address but really right when you come out and take a left you're right in Pigeon Forge and kind of all the action but then when you come back to your RV you feel all secluded you got the mountain views and and uh it's just it's really just spectacular yeah this is actually a view when we spent the day at the adventure Works um I guess it was a zipline climb swing whatever um it's right on site so if you have kids it was really a lot of fun um something to do that was a little adventurous but you're just right there by your site so that's why that's where we got this shot we kind of spent the day up in the air and had a little bit of fun yeah that was a lot of fun yeah a lot lot to do around this park for sure so there you have it it's the River Plantation RV Resort right there in Seville Tennessee and uh I got to tell you it's not something we do very often but I'm going to give it a give it the thumbs up and a recommendation from from us and we see a lot of parks this is a great one yeah reasonable clean full of the amenities you want um but still secluded absolutely loved it we will go back absolutely",

we've got our Tiff and fton couple month ago yeah about a month a month ago and uh and then we've kind of gone off on a a trip around to do some RV shows and we're Towing the 4Runner and uh yesterday we had an it was the first time Towing the it was the first time Towing the the 4Runner we had an incident that I wanted to share with everybody and uh basically Tammy uh ran into the back of the faton with the 4Runner I was technically not in the 4Runner when it happened so no okay so she so she technically wasn't in it when the 4Runner which makes it even more confusing so uh what exactly happened it actually started with being your fault okay because we were pulling out of that tight spot we were in a tight spot right and for some oh and we didn't have cell phone coverage so we couldn't talk each other usually which is what we do we usually communicate yep and you were pulling out and then this tree I can see it jumped out of nowhere yeah that's what it did and obviously you could not see it and it caught one of the slide Toppers oh well oh I so I was driving yeah and I was behind you him and the Forerunner but that was that's but that's what I call incidental contact yeah whatever no I was driving and I I kind of grazed a tree that's like that's like in a basketball game where like they're kind of running into each other and but but the referee doesn't call it so I lay on the horn I see it in my mind it's about to rip the entire slide topper off and he's just acting like he I stopped you stopped cuz I honed the horn not cuz you hit it okay so he's he stops for a second and then I try to call him again cuz I'm freaking out I'm no service no service no sell service so then for some reason you start going again yeah cuz I look back and I don't see her doing anything and I wasn't even sure if it was her honk and the horn so I start going again and she lays on the horn I'm stroking and now I see her back in her window doing this right here and so I'm like I guess something's wrong so I get out of the RV and look and I I'm I'm I am touching you are the awning is touching a tree uh it could have been bad yes but again it was kind of in I saved the day let's just remember this part of that story she saved the day yes so I get out of the Forerunner did I mention it was her birthday yesterday yeah this all happened like right when woke up on my birthday right but so I jump out of the Forerunner run around it and it's just sitting there the Forerunner like like a car does when you get out of it and I run around I go to the front door you know the the door and I'm like wo you hit this and you know and he's like oh let me back up so go get in the 4Runner and now here's what I see at this point because I'm in the RV and I can see my screen and uh so basically what I see as I walk back to the Forerunner is the Forerunner starts moving towards the RV and I'm like Tammy didn't have time to get to the 4Runner and the 4Runner is now barreling towards the RV was and the next thing I see is Tammy running around the corner trying to I guess stop the RV I did I actually put my hands on the truck like I thought I was going toad stop it bad safety safety bad idea didn't make that one and all I can do is watch in the in the Monitor and she jumps in I brace for impact and Bam it did hit it it it hits and uh that was the worst feeling to go around the RV and I literally see the Forerunner heading straight to the month old RV I was about to get sick it was the and there's people watching because after I laid on the horn I got everybody's attention in the whole Campground so we have an audience but because it was her birthday I I kind of was like I reass reassured her to let her know she actually saved the day because High fived me a high five thanks for saving them but shall we look at the damage yes we should it's not as bad as I thought it Dam one I thought we were going to rip the blueox off I mean I thought it was going to be bad all right let's look at the uh damage I know everybody wants to see it okay all right let's do it okay this is the damage that I caused through my incidental contact and The Runaway incidental Runway Forerunner I would have not uh so you can see um actually it's not dented and I have not tried to see if I can get some of this paint off but 4Runners White and you can see that there's uh actually looks better when I just wipe it off you can see there's definitely some marks and that's actually paint that has come off so it's definitely going to need Paint now the the bad part really gets over here it's not horrible but you can see where the uh the fiber glass is cracked so I'm going to need yeah that's uh and it's a little bit Yeah the more I look at it the worse it gets and then the 4Runner the 4Runner actually took a pretty decent shot here uh uh you know you've got the old paint coming off the Forerunner little bit no Dent though I mean no dent I guess not but uh Liquid Paper will just fix that right Liquid Paper yeah do they make Liquid Paper in that color I don't know so anyway that was our day yesterday we want to share it with everybody because uh you know when you're on the road we're learning uh with everybody else and this is just one of those things it was kind of a one in a million let's hope it's a one in a million and uh but it happened and uh you know we should have just slowed up and um and taking our time getting out of that part cuz it was so tight in there and uh maybe we got some pictures of that I don't know but or maybe not it was so tight and I know a lot of us experienced that but um you know what we learned a lesson there we got to kind of take our time and just make sure uh that we're doing things properly and um in that case we kind of got in a little bit too big of a hurry so there you go techno RV happen with the uh with the birthday for Tammy okay and one more thing uh we're at a spr you can keep talking okay all right and one more thing uh we're at a very cool Park it's called Uh Shady Grove Shady Grove uh and it is right inside of like cuming Georgia somewhere around in that area and uh it's really

{"id": "lD7C6K6Ncsg", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "ibqSDfSqewZY-D3WFTzm3xVU248", "transcript": "there are two ways to tell if your rand mcnally needs to be updated in maps when you turn your rand mcnally on if your map database is out-of-date it will actually tell you that it will let you know your map database is over a year old and there may be a database available so that's one way also when you hook it up to the docking station it will let you know if you have map updates available or just any update available so there are two ways to find out if you have an update available for your rand mcnally okay the first step in doing your lifetime maps for Rand McNally is to actually go to where you're going to have to download the docking station I just put in Rand McNally lifetime maps to get you know to the page but it's actually the Rand McNally support Doc's software you have the option free mac and windows I'm a Windows user save it to somewhere I saved it to my desktop here and then open up the file you'll get a prompt that says do you want to run the program welcome to the InstallShield wizard yes I want to accept the terms of the license yes next and then click install to begin now it's telling me that I need a device to be connected so at this time I need to actually connect my 7730 or 7720 or whatever Rand McNally I'm updating the maps to once it's connected the screen on your 7730 or your GPS is going to say connected so once it says connected then you'll be able to click yes and the computer will recognize that it's been connected and it will take you to the next step of the installation minimize this screen that lets you know it is connected and just click yes now actually if you want to backup your device I'm going to say no just to walk you through the process quicker English is my language and I'm finished now that just means the docking station is installed and I'm not going to have to go through that ever again so now the dock is initialized and it's going to pull up the screen that tells me what I have to work with as far as updates do I have maps available or dirty GPS updates available and so forth going forward I won't have to go through that process again I'll just plug the GPS in and it will recognize it but if you've never done it before you do need to go in and install the dock station so a screen comes up telling you what type of updates you have I have one basic update available I'm going to do that one first they're usually very small you do have to be hooked up to high-speed Internet to do these updates it's going to take one second to actually download this I'm going to begin the download it's going to tell me that I have some rated points of interest do I want to share the ratings yes I'm going to do that you don't have to so that's how long it took to download it I have to transfer it though to the device I do not need internet for that but again you can see it took no time whatsoever for this so let's go back now and see what else is available now I know I have lifetime maps but because it's not first time I've not registered for them so I'm going to go ahead and register that's how long it took because it has all my information already and it knows it's a 7730 and I'm going to do the same thing I just did for the other update this one's going to be larger because it's the map update again you have to be hooked up to high-speed Internet I'm hooked up to a Verizon my five 4G card 3G will not work so this is 15 minutes and 27 seconds and it will do the same process that you just saw on the other updates so this is going to take about 15 minutes you'll see it jump up and down and we'll come back and see when it's finished now be aware that halfway through the installation you're going to finish downloading the update and it's going to transition it's going to say download complete and you're going to have to actually install the update so the whole process may take about 15 minutes but midway through its going to say download complete install update one requires the Internet this one is not requiring the Internet to actually install the update but you do have to keep the device connected okay so the update did take about 15 to 17 minutes it is finished so you're going to see at the end when it gets to the you know the seconds in the minutes and everything countdown it's going to say update complete thank you for updating your Maps I'm going to go to the back button where it should tell me that my maps are up-to-date so no longer does it say I have a map update but it does now say I have another update available so after updating my lifetime maps I actually have another update available possibly because now I've updated maps and there's something else there that I need to do so I'm just going to pop through that same update that I just did before again those updates are generally very short a second or so so I'm going to do that download remember that you know make sure that you just do the download and the transfer although you don't have to have internet for the transfer I usually just keep all the internet hooked up through it throughout it it's a second here and then it's going to ask me to actually transfer the file as you see it says internet connection not required but again it's it's very very short update usually when it asks you to do just the updates not the not the actual map update okay so once this is completed I still want to go back and make sure everything is good before I disconnect and you can go to seeing your other options while you're connected to the dock so while you are connected to the dock I could register for track traffic everywhere import goods am club trip maker imports make custom points of interest a lot of different things while you're connected to the dock which will look at it later videos so that is how that you update your rand mcnally is using the rand mcnally ducks software once you've completed your updates and you turn your rand mcnally on you will no longer see the notification that you have updates available it'll just give you the regular warning and legal consent page that you normally see where you have to accept it every time you turn your GPS on you'll also see a possibility that it will kick you back to the classic mode or a different mode than you had when you originally had your GPS set up before it put me back in classic mode when I normally use ice mode so once you do your updates it's really important to go back through your rv's information set up your size of your RV check your preferences and warnings and make sure that everything that you had in your RV GPS is the same that make sure the updates didn't kind of change anything or kick any of your preferences out because you want to make sure that it's still routing you according to your size and weight and width and everything so that's the first thing I would do after going through your updates is just double check everything because you want to make sure you're safe out there while using the GPS we do have a couple more videos on the rand mcnally gps systems we have one when you set up your RVs information setting preferences setting up warnings we also have one on five different ways to impress tenacious so we're always putting new videos up on how to use your rand mcnally gps so you can check us out on youtube and the techno RV page subscribe to us or to that playlist and you can get notifications anytime we add a new Rand McNally video and until then happy traveling stay safe", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2016-03-29T23:50:43Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "TechnoRV Rand McNally 7730 Learning Series: Updating Maps on the

Suburban water heater and uh one of the ways that you can tell which brand of water heater that you have is uh the Suburban water heater we'll have the uh vent on the right hand side uh of the door here and uh Atwood water heater will have a vent on the the left side so this is definitely a suburban and the the Suburbans have a steel tank and uh so to prevent uh corrosion they use an an anode rod which basically this just kind of sacrifice itself for the the greater good of your tank and uh if you have an Atwood tank they have aluminum tanks and so an anode rod is uh not required although sometimes people use them but they're certainly not required so let's go ahead and uh break this thing open and uh get in here and change this anode rod out okay let's go ahead and get the door off here just turn that off and this door just comes comes off here and uh so what we got here just some of the major components of uh the Suburban water heater you got your uh your gas valves here and they're controlled by a a circuit board uh you've got your thermostats uh behind this enclosure here and then your burn chamber is uh is in here and then this is your burner tube and this your ignition probe uh right here so that's kind of the major components of uh of the water heater and here's your pressure relief valve up here and so the uh anode rod is basically right here so but before we take the anode rod off there's a couple of steps that we need to go ahead and take care of um one is is is making sure that that everything's shut off to the um hot water heater uh your gas and electric and try and get some of that hot water out of the out of the hot water heater tank and I've got a a 10-gallon tank here so let's go ahead and take care of that first this is the control panel in my fifth wheel and uh my hot water heater has gas and electric and I usually don't even run my gas but uh step one here is to uh go ahead and just turn off the electric and if you have the gas on of course turn that off off as well once you've turned off the gas and electric to the hot water heater then uh you'll just want to go ahead and just start running some hot water water out and go ahead and get uh get the hot water out of the tank so that whenever you pull the anode rod out and water comes out that it won't be hot water coming out uh all over the ground so you don't want to burn yourself so we'll go ahead and let it run here until we get that out okay now that we've uh turned off the the gas and electric to the hot water heater and drain the hot water out um that the Tank's still full just doesn't have hot water in it now uh which is going to be good here's some of the tools that you'll need to get this done of course you'll need an anode rod and uh that's what one looks like new I'm a little bit concerned about what our is going to look like when it comes out because it's um you're supposed to uh clean these uh units out at least every year and change your anode rod and I'm over a year so we'll see what it looks like but anode rod you can get this at techno rv.com you also just need some uh threaded seal tape to uh go around the threads of the anode rod and uh to get the the anode rod out you're going to need a uh 1 and 1/16th in uh socket that'll fit right over that and then uh these can be a bit difficult to get out so uh I've got this little unit right here that's going to help me kind of put some muscle behind it uh you can use a ratchet some people use a cheater bar uh impact wrenches can be real good and then uh the only other thing that you'll need and you can get this on techno rv2 is is uh this allows you to go up into the to the tank uh when the water's in your tank the sediment will drop out of the water and even when we drain drain the tank you'll have a a quart or so of water in the bottom that'll have all the sediment in it and it's really you really got to get that out of there and this will uh this will do the job of making sure that comes out so uh let's go ahead and uh and get to work here we're going to go ahead and uh take out the the anode plug and uh when I do this water is going to going to start coming out and uh I'm just going to put some muscle behind this and see if I can get it going okay that wasn't horrible move this out of the way before water starts coming out all right we ought to start getting some water here now there we go there we go and so the water is uh the water's not hot right now because I've already drained the water out and uh so there's what an anode rod looks like uh when it's used you can see this one's taking a pretty good hit now they can be much worse than this so this isn't actually horrible but it's certainly uh in need of changing so uh we're just going to sit here and let this water drain out and uh after that drains out then we'll uh clean the inside of the tank make sure all the sediment out and then we'll uh get the rod back in okay so the water is out of our tank here you see it's just a little dribble here now and uh we have had a a pretty decent amount of sediment uh coming out you can see that it's the kind of thing that's coming out um and so there's there's still more of this in the tank because just by the nature of how these tanks are made there's still probably a quart or so of water here at the very bottom just because it kind of dips in below this point and uh so we've uh got this we sell these at techn rv.com and it's basically a hot water um heater cleaner and you just basically stick it in here and it's it's really just high pressure high pressure water really high pressure water that was only on about a tenth of the way so I'm going to go ahead and put this in here and and you'll just want to angle that down like this and then start pulling it forward so you really want to make sure that you you keep your hand on this because if you don't that thing jumps out of there you're going to get wet and I can see more sediment coming out of the tank and then you can turn this thing and clean all up in the tank as well because um depending on how long it's been since it's been clean sediment can set up on the walls of the tank too I can really feel a light coming out of here just on my hands I mean you can just see that we are in dire need of a cleaning here got my hand right here I can feel the water coming out on it and I can feel all the sediment hitting it so I'm going to do this um until I don't feel that coming out anymore so this may take a little bit so we'll come back here in just a little bit whenever I'm done but again turn it up to where you get up high and you can see just more sediment coming out and then again turn it to where it's low and then do this where you pull out like that to really get [Music] it yeah a lot of sediment this is doing good this this is a very useful tool so I'm going to keep doing this we'll come back in just a little bit whenever I'm [Music] done all right I've done this uh I don't know I've been at it for probably three or four minutes and I'm not feeling a whole lot coming up but I really did I mean you'll be amazed it's a great tool to have right here Tammy's behind the camera looking at all the stuff coming out of this tank and wondering uh where hot water's been coming from this whole time so you'll be much happier right Tam yeah good good all right so uh we're done here and uh again you can get that little tool right there from techno RV that is a awesome tool and uh simple but awesome so uh now all we have to do is to put the anode rod uh back in and uh and then we'll turn back on our electric and uh gas and this job will be done so you can see the difference here this is obviously the new one this is uh you're supposed to do this at least once a year and uh I don't know Tammy how long have we been I'm almost afraid to say been a year 16 months 16 months okay that's not good uh you don't want to take uh you don't want to go that long but we did and uh we got away with it because the anode rods still got some life in it but nonetheless I already put the U red tape on here so all that's left now is just to get this going and uh and then we'll get my ratchet back out and uh and then the job will be be complete okay now that we've got this uh finger tight here you just get your ratchet back out and uh go ahead and tighten down to make sure this is good and secure here and we've got that thread tape on there you're not going to get any leaks out of this you can test for that okay all right so the anode Rod's back in the Tank's clean and uh so the next step is to turn the uh water back on to the RV so that the tank can fill up and then uh once we've given that time uh to fill up then we'll go ahead and turn our electric on uh uh we don't use gas that much but I could turn my gas on as well but you just want to make sure there's water in the tank before you do that or that can burn up your your heating elements so uh anyway I'm going to turn the water on and that's uh that's how you change the anode rod out in a a Suburban hot water heater [Music] m", "snippet": {"publishedAt":

{"id": "6Zlll4_JBxA", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "16L9-2IKi9PdHDqVSgohaIU-IXo", "transcript": "ah the CEREC with techno RV today we're going to talk about the TST tire pressure monitoring system first of all why should you buy a TST tire pressure monitoring system comes down to quality for us the TST tire pressure monitoring systems were originally developed for the trucking industry million-mile trucks so the quality that they put into them and the expectation that they should keep up with that industry now that we sell these for the RV in the street the quality's still there and you have a couple of different versions that you can choose from one of them is called the 510 TST and the other one's called the 507 TST so I want to talk about the differences today in these two months first the 510 series comes with a five year battery in the sensors that you place on your tires five years now these sensors are not able to be replaced by the user so whenever you want to replace one of these batteries you send them back to TST after five years and they will replace the battery and condition it for you and send it back to you for the cost of 1995 and and then you're good for another five years the 507 version has a sensor that has a user replaceable battery in it so you as the user can actually replace this battery now the battery takes a CR 1632 battery looks like a little watch battery and you can actually take this cap off and replace that battery yourself and that battery usually lasts 10 to 12 months for one of these sensors so there's one main difference in these two models is that again the 510 comes with a non user replaceable battery but it lasts a full five years and the 507 you can replace the batteries yourself and they last about 10 to 12 months now the other thing that the 507 so that the 510 does not is that it also comes with a different kind of sensor both of the models come with with a cap sensor but the 507 comes with a flow-through sensor and the flow-through sensor basically allows the user to air up your tires without taking the sensor off of the valve stem so this is unique to the TST model there's there's no other tire pressure monitoring systems that have the flow-through sensor so we're real excited about that but you basically just take the cap off of the flow-through sensor and air your tire right back up and put the cap on and again this one takes a CR 1632 battery as well and as the user you can replace this mater e2 so that's a one of the difference between the 510 and the 507 the 507 has the the flow-through Center that you can get now another difference between these two models is how you actually program them now this isn't a big deal but when you go to program the sensors into the the monitor on the the 510 version you actually have to manually enter a code into the monitor for it to recognize the sensor it's not that big of a deal and techno RV has a a video online that you can go check out see how to do that the 507 TST automatically programs the code into the monitor so it's still a setup process that you have to go through with the 507 but you're not actually manually entering a code into it again it's not that big of a deal both systems are very easy to install but I did want to point that out that over 510 you manually enter a code a little 507 to the code through the setup process is automatically entered into the the monitor now another difference between these two models is the the different mounts that they come with these two units so the the 510 monitor looks different from from beef the 507 monitor it's actually got a thicker thicker base here on the bottom to where it actually will will sit on your dash and so the 510 actually comes with with a Velcro strip that you can actually place on the bottom of the 510 and that way it'll just sit on your dash to where you can view it like that the other thing that the 505 10 model has as far as a mount it has a little clip that you can connect to the back of it and it'll actually fit on to your air conditioner vent so again the 510 you can either set on your dash with a velcro strip or two click onto your air conditioner strip now the 5:07 model comes with a window mount so that you can actually attach this to your window and and then it also comes with a dash mount so the 5:07 either on the window or it has a mount that you can settle your dash so both of them have have very nice mounts that that will work for you and your RV and that's kind of the difference as it relates to that so some similarities that you have with with both of these units is that the sensors with both units come with anti-theft devices and whether it's the 510 of the 507 once you put these sensors on to your valve stems with a it comes with a special tool to install these and again we've got an installation video online and show you how to do this but once it's on the bow stem if somebody comes to try to take that off of the valve stem it'll just it'll just spin so unless you have that you cannot get these off so both of them whether it's 510 or the 507 both have the anti-theft devices built into the sensors so that's a nice feature there as far as powering these units both of these units come with a 12 volt charger and so that's very nice and then both of these units also come with a hardwire kit so you can actually hardwire both of these units into a 12-volt source if you'd like so that's very nice now the the monitors once they're fully charged you know under normal use you know you can get you know seven to ten days of driving time out of these monitors so that's real nice because you know with all of the different devices that you may have in your RV that that may be plugging into a 12-volt source these monitors don't have to be plugged into a 12-volt source while you're traveling once it's fully charged then you're good to go for five to seven days of normal driving time so that's pretty nice for both of these units so that you don't have that extra core going into a 12-volt device now the 510 unit comes with an additional antenna and basically this can assist you in your monitoring communicating with your with your sensors and basically you would just unscrew this this small antenna here and then you would you would screw in this antenna into this and it's got a long cord with it then you could just mount it now both devices you can get what's called a repeater with these and so what a repeater does is it grabs the signal coming from the from the sensors and it retransmits it with a stronger boosted signal to the monitor so if a sensor is you know the distance from the monitor to the sensor will diminish that signal and so sometimes you may need a a repeater to assist you in getting that signal and we also sell those online but that comes with both units that repeater to us so whichever model you choose whether it's the 510 model that comes with the five year battery or the 507 model that comes with the user-replaceable batteries you really can't go wrong because the TST tire pressure monitoring systems are the industry leader as it relates to rvs so come check these out at techno RV calm and decide which one is right for you and certainly if you have any additional questions about either one of these units then you can

burned one of the prongs on my own the male end of my cord and so today we are going to replace this with the camco replaceable cord and I'm going to go through the process of showing you how to do this to make sure that all the wires are connected properly if you decide to take on this project for yourself so let's get started okay the first step is to go ahead and cut through the mainline here with a nice set of cutters so I'm going to go ahead and do that now okay so we went ahead and cut through the line there and now you can see your your four wires in here your two hots your neutral in here and your ground wire and I want to end a stripped off about a four or five inches of the installation from the other side so that the wires will be exposed and we can work with them and start stripping them down all right the first thing we're going to do is unscrew the two screws at the lower part of the unit and this is just going to take the bracket off that secures the cable once we're completed and once we're done with this we'll start taking the screws out of the cap to go ahead and expose where the wiring will actually be connected into the one nice feature of this is that it's got this piece in here so it's kind of for a smaller table take that out for bigger table inches and probably what we'll do all right and then we just have the three screws here and this is going to take the cap off of this we can connect our wires okay so this is where we're going to connect our wires to and we're going to connect our green wire to the top here let's actually get a green screw here to kind of help you out with that and then your uh white wires going to go on the bottom connection here and then do our red wire over here on this side and then our black wire will go over here on this side so this will work out real nicely so what we need to do now is we need to expose this wire and because this is going to be sitting in here like this we want the green wire to be cut down to about three inches and then we'll want our white wire since it's going to this will be cut down to about an inch and a half and then the red and the black will be cut down to about two inches so I'm actually going to measure that out to make sure that I get that right here exposed from face right here now what I want to do is I want to strip off about three quarters of an inch from each one of these wires and it'll be the exposed portion of the wire that we're actually gonna gonna make the connections to here okay we've got the wires stripped down here nicely and now it's time to just make the connections in the wire into the unit here so the best way to do this is uh actually these just just come right out so this is where your white wire will go so I'm just going to pull that out and you just want to unscrew this just enough to get that wire in there and see that little piece coming right through that hole right there you want to make sure that remains in that piece there remains in that hole and then just take the wire place it in here screw that wire back down good connection there really tighten that down good there okay and you're just gonna slide it back in and the white wires done and what I'll do is I'll do that to the other three wires as well I'll just pull these out and make the connections and slide them back in and it makes it real easy for you so I like that design that they did there so I'm gonna go ahead and get working on those and then we'll finish this project okay so all the wires or connected them now and now it's just a matter of putting the cap on it so as you can see I don't need the insert on this for my 50 amp plug but I'm just gonna take take the screws and cinch down that real good you know keep that in there real tight to where these these wires can't move around and then I'm basically just gonna attach the cap on it just like that so I'll go ahead and do that you want to cinch it down tight but not we're just cutting into the wire you kind of get a feel for that yourself you can see if cinch that down where that wire has no play in it where it's not going to be able pull these wires out so that's kind of the key there and I can't pull that back and forth so these are nice and secure then all we're going to do is just place the cap on it here and then we've got three screws that you need to call go here again this is the Camco 50 amp replacement plug it's really heavy-duty and again it's got the nice handle on the back help you out when you're plugging in and unplugging to make sure you do that nice and safe that's going to do it we've got a good connection in there everything cinched up tight and that is how you replace a 50 amp plug on your RV court so if that was how about that's been helpful",

install the TST 507 tire pressure monitoring system this system comes with one of two different kinds of sensors one is a flowr sensor that allows you to air up your tires without taking the sensor off of the stem and the other one is a cap sensor so today we'll install one of each so let's go ahead and get started this is the monitor for your TST 507 system on the right hand side is the on andof switch let's go ahead and push that up and get this into the on position it has Us in drive mode right now and you can see the tires that I already have programmed rammed into the system and I'm going to install two more sensors on these tires there's two different kinds of sensors that you can get with the 507 one's the flowr sensor which allows you to air up your tires without removing the cap and then the other one is the cap sensor in order to program a sensor into the system we have to get into the program mode in order to do that you're going to want to press press and hold the code button take about four or 5 seconds until you hear a beep hold it down when you hear the beep you're in program mode all 22 tires will show up that's an indication that you're in program mode now what we'll need to do is we'll need to move to the tire that we want to program and you do that by pressing either the plus or minus buttons on the top so I'm going to go ahead and scroll to the tire that I want to get to the tire I want to program this is the first position that I want to program right here it'll show all FS if a sensor has not been programmed into the system yet and what you'll notice is whenever I program the sensor the fs will change to a code so let me go ahead and program the cap sensor into the system now what you'll want to do is you'll want to hold the sensor just close to the bottom of your system and then you'll just want to tap the code button and just like that it's programmed you can see it does not have the fs on the screen anymore it's actually got a program number in there that c is ready to go in that position now let's go ahead and program the next position and I moved higher positions by pressing the plus or minus this is the next position that I'm going to program you can see it's got all fs and this time I'm going to program a flow through sensor same thing just make sure the sensor is right at the base of the monitor you're going to just tap the code button and you'll see all the fs change to the code of this sensor that sensor is now programmed to get out of program mode you're just going to tap the mode button so I'll do that now and as you can see these two tires are now showing up as programmed this is the cap sensor that we're going to install first cap sensor has a anti- theft device on it so you actually place it on the stem with this tool here so you place the tool around the cap like this and then you just screw it onto the [Music] stem you'll hear a puff there and you want to put it on there snug but not too tight and then you can see if somebody tries to take that off that'll just spin right there so once that's on there since it's already programmed into your monitor it'll automatically start reading the PSI and the temperature PSI and the temperature on this uh this sensor here so let's move to the next tire and I'll show you how to install one of the flowr [Music] sensors so now we're going to install the flow through sensor it's a little bit different than the cap the anti- theft device is uh basically a little Allen screw so comes with this allen wrench and uh it's pretty simple basically you you screw the the sensor onto the tire like this then you would take your allen wrench and you would just cinch the screw down onto the stem and that makes that anti- theft nobody's going to be able to take that off now and then again now that the sensor is installed in fact it's already reading uh at 73 p SII and 66° F on here and uh so both of these sensors are installed and that's how you install the uh tire pressure monitoring system the 507 model from TST now what we need to do is go in and set the highs and lows on the PSI and this will be the the PS si in which you want to be notified uh if the the tire pressure drops below a certain amount or goes above a certain amount and in order to do this you're going to press and hold the mode button for four or five seconds until you hear a beep when you do that all of the tires will show up and it'll show PSI right here you hit the mode button again it's going to show Fahrenheit which means you want you want your readings to be in Fahrenheit if you want Celsius you can hit the plus button here goes to Celsius hit the plus button again I prefer Fahrenheit then if you press the mode button one more time it's going to go to your front axle and then this is where you're going to make adjustments now the first PSI that shows up here this is going to be what you want your high side to be it's recommended that you set your high side side about 20% above what the manufacturer's recommendation is for your cold tire pressure if I want to move that up or down then I just press either the plus or minus button 75 is where I want it to be so I'm okay and then if I hit the mode button again it's going to take me to the low side and right now it's set at 55 is where it will notify me if my pressure drops to 55 on that front axle and if I want to move that up or down again can move it down I can move it back up and then to move to the next axle you just hit mode and you just continue to do that now I'm going to go ahead and scroll through the rest of these because the next step is where you would set the temperature at which you want to be notified now the system comes set at 100 158° if the temperature around that sensor gets to 158° it's going to give you a warning I recommend and so does the manufacturer that you just leave it at 158° however if you want to move that number up then again you just press the the plus button you want to move it down you press the minus button and then that's all there is to it you've set your PSI for your axles the temperature set at 158 and then to get back into basically drive mode you're just going to tap the set button and then this takes you into drive mode and these are all the tires that are now programmed and then it'll just scroll through each tire and show you what the the pressure is and what the uh the Fahrenheit is on that tire so there you have it that's the TST 507 tire pressure monitoring system installation process [Music]", "snippet":

{"id": "Mx487RuSO04", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "6Z6FcpqKYI3Qes2t10iSObwlzdw", "transcript": "[Music] this is Eric from techno RV one of the questions we get asked a lot is how can techno RV assist rvers in capturing the Wi-Fi signal from the RV part this isn't always the easiest thing to do but we do have some products that can help they're called wi-fi boosters now the RV part is responsible for the amount of bandwidth they provide to the rvers but you can do yourself a lot of good by applying a Wi-Fi booster to the equation to assist you in reaching out and grabbing that signal that they have provided so we at techno RV have several solutions for capturing that Wi-Fi signal from the RV park so let's take a look at some of them the first one is called a booster tube and the booster tube is actually an antenna that you would install outside of your RV so what we're looking at here is an antenna that has eight DB of gain and the two portion down here has two watts of sending power so the average laptop has about2 uh watts of sending power for their internal Wi-Fi adapter and again that's 02 this has two full watts and generally on the receive side of a laptop you'll get about One DB gain of the internal antenna and on this booster tube you have eight DB of gain so just from the standpoint from the amount of power that uh you'll be replacing basically your internal Wi-Fi adapter with this unit here so what you would do is uh you would install this unit a lot of people do install this on like their ladder rack or their batwing uh it comes with a little mounting bracket and uh some heavy duty zip ties that you can mount this and then it comes with a 16t cable so you would route the 16t cable inside of your RV now some rvers will uh you know just run it through a window temporarily uh some will just run it through whatever ports they can or have it professionally installed to get it inside of their RV uh in any event if you just bought this product right here it would boost the Wi-Fi signal for one device so say a laptop you would run this cord in plug it directly into the USB port of say a laptop and uh and then you would receive the uh boosted signal for that one device now what most people do is uh is they add what's called a repeater to the equation and uh this is our repeater and and basically what the repeater does is it takes the boosted signal from the booster tube and creates a hot spot within your RV so that multiple users can now have access to that boosted signal so in this case you would take the USB line from your antenna and that USB line instead of going into your your laptop would go now go into the repeater and then the repeater has a uh has a wall socket uh adapter so you just plug it into a wall socket and then you would just attach the the antenna onto the onto the repeater so that uh whoever's uh connecting to this wirely wirelessly this will be able to capture that with the antenna so again that's one solution you buy the booster tube and you attach this outside as high as you can on your RV because Wi-Fi is a line of sight uh signal and so the higher you get the better and then you run the line inside attach it to the repeater so you would buy the booster tube and then you would buy the repeater and that would be a complete system now for those that don't want to mount an antenna externally and run the wire inside to the repeater directly into the device there is another unit that we have and it's called the desktop booster the desktop booster sits inside of your RV and this unit offers a full two watts of sending power which is the same as the booster tube so a full two watts of sending power right here and the antenna is a 5 DB gain antenna uh so lots of power here and basically what you do is you take this unit here and you put it inside of its uh of its holder here and then whatever Direction the Wi-Fi signal is coming from uh then you would want to just put the the desktop booster uh next to the closest window uh to that because again Wi-Fi is a line of sight signal so uh this mounta here actually has a suction cup on it and so what I do and a lot of rvers do is they just suction cup this right to a window and that way uh it's in the direction of wherever the the signal is coming from and that gives you the most opportunity to access that signal so again uh this comes with about a 5ft cable and you would plug one end the cable into the desktop booster and the other end would go into the USB port of whatever device that you're wanting to get the boosted signal uh so with that scenario uh one device would be getting the the boosted signal uh from the desktop booster now you can add the repeater to this equation so that multiple users can now access the boosted signal so instead of the cord coming from your desktop booster and going into a single device now the cord goes from the desktop booster into the repeater the repeater has a wall plug that comes with it and that's what's going to power these two devices so now what you have is you're getting the boosted signal from here routing it to the repeater the repeater creates a hot spot within your RV so that multiple users can access the boosted signal wirelessly so that's another solution uh for uh accessing the Wi-Fi signal at your RV park is the the desktop booster and uh the repeater now another nice thing you can do with the desktop booster is that you can actually replace the antenna with a higher DB gain antenna so what a lot of customers will do they'll go ahead and get the desktop uh booster here and then they'll get the the repeater so that they can broadcast a hotspot within their RV so that multiple users can gain access to the boosted sign sign uh they'll set up at a park and uh there there may be occasions that you're so far away from the the access point that uh that even the desktop booster isn't able to reach out and grab that signal and so uh but because it's so convenient a lot of people like like to use this unit because most of the time it's going to work for you but in those instances another thing that you can do is you can just unscrew the antenna from the desktop booster and then you can add uh what's called a yagi antenna and uh this is a directional antenna I know it looks a little strange but uh it comes with about a 3ft cord and what you would want to do is you would want to add the 16t cord that we sell uh at techno RV and uh and that way you can take the yagi antenna outside and wherever the access point is outside you can uh aim the yaggi antenna at the access point okay so because it's a directional antenna if the uh access point is over here then you would want to make sure that you aim it directionally at the access point so again what you're going to be doing here is you're going to uh take the 16t cable and and uh uh connect it to the 3-foot cable that comes with the agie antenna and then you're just going to connect that then to the desktop booster and now you've basically in essence you basically replaced this 5db antenna with a high power directional 16 DB antenna Now by adding the the 16t cable uh you do lose a few DB of gain by doing that but but there's plenty to space with the with the yaggi antenna so again that's just another solution just something else to have in your toolbox as you're traveling uh you could get the the desktop booster the repeater and then you could just get the yaggy and you just kind of set it to the side whenever you need it and uh and that's actually what a lot of people will do because just for the convenience of the desktop booster of just getting to the site sticking it on a window uh going through the setup process getting the access most of the time you're going to be all right with the with the desktop but uh on those occasions where you need need more you could add the yagi antenna to it as well so there you have it that's the the solutions that techno RV has to assist you in connecting to uh the Wi-Fi signal at the RV parts it's the external booster tube uh where you're uh installing an antenna outside you've got the the desktop booster that makes it a little more convenient uh that'll be inside and then of course the repeater works with both of those to create the hots spot within your RV so that uh multiple users can connect wirelessly to the boosted signal and and then lastly uh the ability to add the the yagi antenna to the desktop booster is a is an added bonus to that unit right there now another thing that techno RV has is it relates these products is uh the support that we offer and uh one of the things that we do because we understand sometimes from a technology standpoint it can be a little bit difficult is uh We've created uh our own instructions and we call it the Techno RV learning series and uh what the Techno RV learning series is is uh when you order one of these products uh you'll get an email from us of some instructions that we've put together uh that that we feel like are easy to use use and that are better than the the instructions that actually come with these units so it's easy to follow stepbystep instructions complete with pictures and uh it's really been useful for for the rvers that have bought bought products from us and in addition uh if an rver needs more support then they can always give me a call and I'm happy to to walk uh anyone through the setup process on on these units and uh so that's just another thing we offer it's techn RV learning series and and again you get it with when you order any of these products [Music]", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2015-11-03T21:13:20Z", "channelId": "UCWgNRMvOlCoXmrtbzM3GdEg", "title": "How Can I Boost the Wi-Fi
