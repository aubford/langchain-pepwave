to another episode Adam looking lovely as always you're looking just as good yourself thanks this episode we're really lucky to have a special guest join us we have Captain Nick who has sat on some y in the middle of the sea in Florida um Nick welcome thank you thank you nice for having thanks for having me on on on the show on the podcast so obviously please do introduce yourself and tell us exactly where you are so I'm on a super yach an undisclosed super yach I I obviously can't tell you where I am um you know how that is Agent um we can't always if I had to if I told you i' probably had to kill you um but I'm in Florida on on on one of these fancy big white Yachts um taking care of peplink business uh we actually just deployed some h21 Doms and expanded an sdx Pro system as well making sure that all three styl links are working as they should and yeah that's really good well we've got quite a few things to discuss on this podcast I'm hoping you can stick around for the whole podcast and give your Insight to All Things pep link with us and uh should we jump straight in joey yes let's get into it take it away Nick where did you use pepling where did I use peping where don't I use peping we use peping anywhere um so obviously we do primarily primary um Marine deployments so where we where we find peplink to be the the key to success is is is multiple things right the the possibility of blending V sets styling sh Wi-Fi Cellular Connections 4 5G and all of the above you know all together using speed Fusion uh to connect unbreakable connectivity right um and you know over the over the past 10 years I've been using peplink to to deploy these Solutions and um you know each year goes by with new features that just makes it easier and bidder and just overall a nicer solution to work with um yeah so what are your go-to peplink products what do you really like using in the Marine space I think our preference is always our the the the HD1 domms is is a massive favor of us you know because we don't have to pull long antennas you know in the past we used to pull massive big you know coaxial cables LMR 400 and 600 big cob cables that are difficult to get to and and you know obviously the longer cables We Run The more cable loss we're going to get so that's a big favor ours um and obviously with the introduction of synergy mode uh that um that product you know completely transformed how we can make the web interface look so we typically pair like an HD1 Dom or HD2 the duo ones with an sdx Pro um or balance 580 or balance 780 even the 380s as well all depending on on how many how much van we need on that particular vessel um yeah and you've you've already spoken that use vat and Technologies like that I suspect that star Link's probably been a massive game changer for you huge huge I mean it's mean that we've gone from having you know very little bandwidth to you know quite literally Broadband on the Open Seas you know we can sit and stream 4K in the middle of the Pacific or the Atlantic on a Crossing uh but it also now means that people can live on board pretty much all year round we we have owners now that their primary residen is now their super yacht or their super Yachts you know multiple you know because they don't need to have an office to do their work anymore they can do all their uh meetings on board they can do their teams call we can do corporate interlinks as well we've done so in the past two years we've done so many you know private speed Fusion tunnels into corporate Networks so they can reach their corporate uh content I mean massive Game Changer again it just means that we can be connected anywhere at any time at high speeds and because of the sheer price of it as well we can suddenly have so many of them for less than half of what we could do with vet traditionally so yeah massive Game Changer I mean it obviously means that a lot of the EGS are put in the same basket as well which means we we always keep contingencies right so we still keep vets alive we still keep cellular alive um um so just because something new and fancy came along doesn't mean we've discarding the old Solutions it just means that we now have even more ways of getting online and and more redundancies so I suppose this is where peplink fits in really really nicely and that it's it's future proof as a package as well you can put whatever gamechanging technology comes out in the future peplink is already there ready to make use of it that's right that's right I mean it just means that we again we have that flexibility so when one web comes out when Kyer comes out whatever comes next when not limit it by by that at all we we just welcome changes you know all the time it's oh something new comes out well another Vin Port here we go and it's just super easy to add add onto it and tag onto it and and obviously with the with the continued refinement of speed Fusion we just keep on being a able to you know make these connections work better and better and better time the maritime space isn't something I'm very familiar with but I think Joey you've done quite a bit with mavi time haven't you yes yes and all of those devices that Nick mentioned as well we see being used in the maritime as well especially on super yachs um but Maritime is bigger and we see now that the integration of Starling but still using 4G 5G as a backup or additional bands we we seen the combination being used way more often now compared to the traditional feat but still people especially commercial vessels still need that redundancy uh in many ways and also opting for feet as well still because it's getting a bit more cheaper from my understanding so it's it's really really nice um addition to to this yeah absolutely and and you know a lot of providers as well has been struggling you know which means they're having to being forced to change the way that they can do their plans you know we can do daily vet plans now we can do so many things in a very flexible way because they've had to change because the market has been blown up completely by styling right so it's it's a welcoming change and it's something that the vset industry and the satellite space have been needing for a long time the mini as well you used the Sim injector mini that one is also being used for the SIM cards to The Domes right that's right we use sim injector minis especially with the new mini I mean we obviously traditionally use the normal Sim injector but the new mini um because it's Poe powered we can power it from our sdx Pro we can power it from a pu injector basically we can place it anywhere on the boat as well so it's quite often if it's a Sailing Boat for example we don't have you know a nice tidy Rec Space somewhere you know we we we can't just access easily so it'll be behind a cupet or in a guest area or something else so the Sim injector we can certainly just have pop out on the desk of the captain's office for example for for putting in SIM card so we can put it in a very convenient place so again these Technologies are stuff that we it just makes it so much easier to deploy that no other product can do for us that's great but I mean to be honest we we we've been we've been using Synergy mode as as a whole we've been using for so many different things with um you know with um with companies who who's sold like an mbx mini or or HD2 or whatever and and it's not quite the right fit for purpose or you know we can't pull long cables or whatever you know we use like again an SX Pro or 580 down in the bottom of the vessel and then at the top of the boat in the sundate we we place the br2 pro or or an mbx or whatever and then we run that in Synergy mode all through the internal um infrastructure of the boat through you know um vlans through internal switches which again something we can't do with other products and it just it's just so easy and it it gives us that flexibility to to add products of all sorts of all sorts of types yeah to to the mix great all right um so let's uh let's start with some exciting news um I think just before we start recording this episode 8.5.1 rc2 has been released by The Ping team on the Forum guys I think we all like to do a little bit of a uh firmware Bingo Nick do you have anything this uh release candidate or beta firmware that you like I worked on that one um probably um most of it is actually bugs not so much feature requests um but yeah we've had a couple bugs that that will that will be ired out hopefully um but some of the things that I'm quite eager about is is the um fallback to on APN modes when set to Auto um I think that's that's quite a quite a good one for us that sounds quite good for your space anyway when when You' set something to a APN and um oops I need to go back now yes we have that numerous times you know where we get recommended by by you know by someone oh you need to try this APN and it's like oh it doesn't actually work and then you know it can then fall back to to to one that that does work so yeah that's a massively helpful feature for us because most of what we do is remote anyway um so so that's a big one yeah cool nice um yeah I think Adam do you did you wrote one down as well well this is I'll be honest this isn't one for me i' I've read through this release note before and you know that you and I really started this podcast up because we love talking about release notes which is really sad but at the same time really quite cool this one here I thought is rather interesting and shows how people are using their peplink devices and this is when you now disable the cellular one on your router it automatically puts your router into airplane mode I've always taken a peplink device on trains with me because I think their internet's not very good and it's interesting the progression there is now to take it onto a plane with you and before you couldn't use your peplink device and set up your little hotspot Network um but now you can and I be honest I've done this on my phone numerous times I'll pay for the Wi-Fi on the plane and I'll share it amongst the family so they can all connect and Hotpot off me but now I can just take my little peplink device disable the cellular one connect to the Wi-Fi one and I can give the whole plane Wi-Fi if I want to yeah Wi-Fi R to Wi-Fi AP nice so I'd be really interested to know who is actually using it on a plane and why peping have had to come out with this release because there must be some interesting use cases that are out there already but that's quite a I think that's quite an exciting one for me I mean I suppose it could also be used in spaces where you're not allowed to use cellular devices military bases or something else where you can only use Wii there's got of be a reason for it right really interesting feature that I've spotted there yeah I'm wondering if the GPS will also be disabled then most most of us have the GPS on on the cellular modules as well right or is that only with the 4G versions not with the 5G anymore I don't know if I'll worry about the GPS working while I'm on a plane um I'm hoping the plane's GPS is going to be working just right but yes you'd hope so come on Joey I've seen you've made a list of ones you want to talk about you're just being polite and letting us yes I am I am um so the one that I specifically requested or actually talking over with gidas as well about testing the um speed Fusion tunnel as well but also the when analysis you can now and I've already tested it and I already showed you guys as well that I hit my fair use policy on my SIM card um testing it out uh no you can now test up to 3,600 seconds duration and you can even set it on a one minute interval that's that's that's that's about yeah that's a lot of testing that's a lot of data yeah it's very good if you want to do that extended test though isn't it yes because it will change over time the test that you do in those first 20 seconds doesn't really show what it's going to be like over an hour or a longer period of time so it's nice to get those samples and to really get some good information from the test yes yeah it it gives you an idea of what what is possible over a long period of time what customers could do what is there what so if you do a pro of concept or if you're doing an install like neck is doing uh you can test that for an hour and see how that goes and you can see for example the stall links you can see how they form switching around switching those over an hour so it's really interesting and I I feel like that gives a really good feeling of how a setup could work in in in the field come on then what what's your next one Joey added support for grouping networks by domain names for use in firewall and Alburn policies so I had to look this one up is one of yours as well is is it no okay no I had to look this one up because I was like oh that's going to be interesting and I I had a chat with Steve like where can we use this and what can we do with it it's a really nice one and actually it's a pretty pretty specific one because you can add in your web admin you can add uh group networks into a added to a feland for example and then you can group that and you can add it to domain to that as well so you can use it internally if you need to have some the name resolving uh uh going on inside your network or you can use this a really really small chance that you can use this as a like I can restrict YouTube on that I need to double check but I think that's that's bit how it goes well it helps us with a lot of these filtering of outgoing policies right because we'll we manage our vlans quite strict you know on on the boats you know when we got crew on board we not only do qos in terms of bandwidth control but also where traffic can go and obviously sometimes we want to group things as well so this is probably a derived out of some of the requests we've been pushing for for a long time which is just further refinement and easier grouping because on a on a 150 meter yacht with 6 700 devices on board we need easier management for things that come in and out and we need to group things we'll have you know 25 30 vlans all sorts of different types and some networks we want to manage in certain way so this is going to help us with that uh immensely and and also so you know obviously for cruise ships commercial ships fairies and so on it'll be the same yeah yeah it's it's like peping again uh stopping up well they're listening to the feedback we provide you know and they understand the feature request we're putting through and it's not just oh we want to have this feature because it'll be nice no it's actually useful and it'll make you know it'll value add to our clients and our customers and it'll again it'll even though we have loads of bandwidth with styling we still need to manage it you know we do a lot of quality of service work on our on our uh client vessels whether it's limitations or or outgoing policies um or even just qos stuff you know voice come off first you know certain networks have priority over all the traffic they go through as so yeah makes a big difference and I see here Nick you've got one about GPS as well yeah I mean GPS is an important one for us and one of the one of the feature requests we've been working on for a while is having the ability to select where device gets GPS from I'll give you an example like the vessel I'm on right now we have three sty links two HD1 dorms um and and lots of other ways so we basically got five ways of getting a GPS location so which actually we got seven ways because we have a UDP and a TCP uh data stream on the boat as well which is coming from navigation systems so we got seven ways of getting GPS but we have no way of actually prioritizing that and which one is the most important one and sometimes we'll have issues where you know if we use sing or HD1 doome it might thinks it somewhere else and then we get the ntp and the time zones wrong so a lot of things plays into our space for that but it also means we can get an accurate GPS GPS from a navigation system which is obviously better than what you'll find in a peplink product or in styling so we'll get you know down to um centimeters rather than meters of accuracy really interesting that's good nice so we use quite a often we we use these GPS's to then track best track tenders so smaller boats so bigger boats will have you know smaller boats to take people ashore and other places and we put peplink devices on there as well not only for for internet styling but also for tracking them and and and and monitoring where where vessels are cool all right well that's also nice and also a nice feature that referring back to the last episode is with the icons you can now change those icons uh I'm wondering if you if do you put a picture of the tender then there or anything do you change that we we do for some clients we upload custom photos and we we put little little things on if they ask for it um and some of the boats we we we get like little icons of the actual boat as well that we put on oh cool nice cool great um but that's not a new feature it's been around for a while hasn't it I mean we've been able to do custom icons for quite a while now and in control so yeah uh for this we this month this episode tips and tricks by Adam and Joey Adam what do we have I wanted to talk about Fusion Hub and the different versions of fusion Hub um Fusion Hub solo Fusion Hub solo is a free license that you can get per peplink device and you can download a license key from in control and install it as a virtual machine in places like Amazon web services vulture um you can even install it on your own virtual machine as well there's no limit it comes as a um as a virtual machine image you can install and that allows you to connect one device at a time to that Fusion Hub but if your device also has Prime care you can then connect an additional device to an existing Fusion Hub and you can connect as many devices as you like as Prime Care licenses you have across those correctlink devices is that right yes yes you can add additional Prim care devices as long as they have a Prime Care subscription active you can connect that to a fusion up so not to a hardware uh endpoint but to a virtual endpoint like the fusion n you can pinpoint to that with a prime car and not consume any PI so this is just Fusion Hub solo if I had had say for example a b15g at home and I tried to connect 10 devices that all had prime care that wouldn't work no no that that doesn't work it only works to a fusion up as an end point but there's not just Fusion Hub solo there's other Fusion Hub packages as well aren't they correct yes which which are they remind me so uh you've got a license with five beers which is the essential then you C the fusion of pro which has 20 license or 20 Piers sorry and from there on you have the fusion of 100 the fusion up 500 uh even you can go up to Fusion up 4,000 with 4,000 PA so um yeah there's there's a lot of options there so Nick in in your world in Maritime again is is Fusion Hub quite a key part of your deployment Absol absolutely um we use both privately hosted ones and publicly hosted ones most of it is um when it's privately hosted it's usually within a data center for corporate exess um publicly hosted will typically use for you know routing traffic that we don't care about where it's go so that'll be you know going on Netflix going on Hulu going General browsing that'll be on a public uh virtual machine somewhere um typically don't use Amazon or a you always try to go in a private data center we we find that that's a little bit faster um it's going to obviously more EXP expensive but um we we found that that's a better experience for what we do um but yeah we we use it all the time most of our clients use it then obviously some clients also choose to use the peplink um speed Fusion connect which is obviously the same concept but using their infrastructure uh that's being used um quite often as well we we can obviously do fixed data planes for that now we can do unlimited data planes on speed Fusion connect now which is somewhat new in the past um I don't know when we got it introduced but something that we drove um like a number of years ago so we actually got the unlimited speed Fusion data ples which was not available before so basically a monthly or yearly subscription so you got unlimited data that was something we drove because a lot of our clients was asking for exactly this because they were venturing around the world and wanted to be able to connect to particular endpoints around the world using the the peping network and yeah so that that's another way of how that spawned out but yeah we use Fusion Hub solos and Essentials all the time yeah we host a number of services ourselves as well uh we we use Partners as well servers through clients and because of the amazing pattern Network in peplink you know a lot of us as competitors actually you know share service across each other with clients because we have hosted in different countries which is awesome and for those people that don't know Fusion Hub is virtual so you can't use it as you would a traditional peplink you've got one wamp port on there you can have a lamp port on there but it's very basic in functionality you can't have VLS on there the routing is is very very different there's not a lot of things you can really manipulate as far as traffic shaping and things like that outbound policies Etc uh so it's a very basic cutdown version of a peplink all right so onto the next subject the pink news always exciting to see if uh agent Adam has found some new news uh or newest items So Adam what were you up to oh well I I did full reconnaissance this time and I had to borrow Nick as well to help and we infiltrated West Network's um peplink Tech Summit to find out some new exciting things that going on Alex was there gave a really interesting presentation about future devices and things that could be coming out um I think one of the most interesting devices just because you you know I love extreme configurations and I love taking peplink to really crazy levels and they bought out a new 5,000 EC router and I don't know if you've seen the stats on this but it's absolutely crazy I mean if I give you some ideas the raw bandwidth on there um that it can do is 110 gigabits per second I mean just take that in that is absolutely crazy it has got 100 gigabit ports on there you know we were talking about the switches how they had the qsft ports this has qsft 28 ports and they can support 100 gbits each there's two of those ports on this device the speed Fusion throughput is 30 gigabits per second that that is almost six times higher than the epx has that is six times highest because that's limited to 4 gbits and on top of that it's it's an edge compute so you can put your kvms on there you can put your um Dockers on there it's an absolute Beast of a machine this is and I think it's either has been launched or is about to be launched um we've certainly seen it and we've played with it and we've had our hands over it and it's a really really nice bit of Kit so I'm wondering I'm I only looked at the data sheet but can you remove those uh modules is it like the epx you can remove those modules well I did ask for a screwdriver but nobody had one they wouldn't let me look inside cuz I wanted to have a look there's certainly modules that screw in and it's definitely a different back play it uses different Flex modules to the ones that we've used before but I think it has to because the bus speed has to be higher to cope with the speeds of those ports that are being plugged in but I did you manage to get one apart Nick to I have a look at no I wasn't allowed to I I came with a screwdriver and people said no no no no no no no so so yeah we weren't allowed to all but the other thing that we saw there Joey and I know that you want to talk about this as well are the new Max antennas that are coming out yes and you've got one there we also saw a new one as well which is going to take a slightly bigger device yes the one you've got there will take the um br1 versions I'm guessing of the br1 pro 5G we also saw this other one which was very very prototype the one we saw I mean it was just a plastic box but we can see where that's going to evolve but go on tell us about this new product yeah so this is the the max antenna it's uh this is the top one so it literally it sits like this so this is where the antenna is it has four antennas in it and then the top is there you it comes with all sorts of things like those kind of connectors that you can connect to if the camera will yeah um yeah it looks like a 42 Mobility it is it is actually I have the 42 M 42g Mobility here as well with all the cables so the theory behind this is we already know the shorter the cable the less signal loss that we get and Nick's perhaps a better expert on this than me i' I've seen him do his calculations um it's absolutely amazing but by making that distance as short as possible and this is what they did on the HD1 Dome and the long range Dome as well we can increase the signal significantly by having less cable absolutely but it also gives you the ability to upgrade it as well so if a new B1 came out or something you wanted to take advantage of we can put that back inside the same antenna box yes yes if it if it Mees the same dimensions because it's it like there is SC uh holes for it uh to be mounted specifically for the br1 pro 5G for the bl1 mini 5G and the transid Duro so the the new Transit Pro e is a little bit thicker than than the old Transit because of the heat sink on it but I don't think that's going to fit I think the space is too limited but uh yeah you could upgrade and tell us about the other exciting accessory they're bringing out for it yes so peplink might be releasing as well the splitter I've seen some pictures of it some early models of it but they are still analyzing everything so even from like the pricing to the design so there's not much yet to to tell about it but um they are looking into and the splitter there is a place for it already so you can see here those brackets those are for splitter so either you can 3D print your own casing for your own Poe splitter and you can run run up one cable to the max adapter uh Max antenna sorry yeah so it's basically being able to run Poe up to it and then the poe would split off into a DC connector you could plug into your max device exactly yeah we we've done that already with with some of the trend sets we've run over poe just breaking out into you 12 volt adapter you know yeah oh nice cool very useful um yeah another thing is the Ping to the this week released the um lab exercises so pink has been chatting around with us I don't know if you were included as well Adam about the lab exercises for a additional training for people that want to get familiar with the pink um user user interface or in control they have released the first five set of tasks or exercises that you can do um with your own device have you seen those already uh only the ones you sent me through the other day those those five presumbly is this an extension to the PC is this a lead into the PC to the training courses or is this totally separate from the training courses it it is practically what else is needed for the pce well it's not a official like you need to to pass those things to to do the PC no it's it's an addition to get more familiar with literally doing the stuff so within the pce you require to have some some peplink uh knowledge and also get familiar with the web admin to find certain stuff but those lab exercises really fit well in into into that perspective of how is the web admin looking and it really helps you with completing the PC if you if you're new to peplink and as well for our like US veterans already using some time with B link uh it's also good to yeah freshen up stuff and also maybe there's new stuff because they are based on the 8.5.0 firmware so there might be some new stuff as well there so where can we get a hold of these lab exercises then they are in the training portal wow do you know I did I did some training for the PCA last week um Nick remind me where is that training portal on peplink how can I find the training portal training. pep link.com right uh yes exactly you've got a long trip home Nick so you know you could on the plane on the way back and now you've got that mode on your peplink where you can turn off um the cellular and have airplane mode you got a perfect test lab environment I suppose I could do that but it's hard to pluck in well I suppose could plug in my mbx mini on the plane but it's quite big to have that sitting on the just ask is there a power outlet oh there is but you know it's possible I'm not saying no I mean it maybe it's something I should be trying on the way it it'll make a good picture people will look funny at you yeah Adam I have high hopes for this one come on the joke the joke I mean we've spoken about marriage before and we've spoken about peplink engineers but one thing got me thinking the other day how did trees get online with a peplink no they just log on yeah Nick you don't look impressed no not impressed and my first thoughts would being that they will be they they Branch out but um they Branch out no they log on they log on log they log on they that log on how they do we one of those I don't feel like I'm getting a good score this time jer no I think I think this one no I think the the F you did the first one in the first episode was so good I think you set the bar a little bit too high I think you're right okay I'll I'll rate this one as well um six out of 10 yeah I think that's quite generous but thank you i' rated myself a three I'm I'm I'm disappointed in myself I'll I'll work harder for the next one okay all right um feature time or feature request highlight Nick you are the guest of honor today do you have a feature that you want like want to highlight in in this topic yeah I mean and like I mentioned you know before we we use Synergy mode quite quite often you know it's it's a a feature that we um we've come to love and and use every day um you know it just simplifies things for the end user and and obviously for us as well it means so we can suddenly do things within one web interface you know I don't have to lock into multiple devices to manage v v configurations and uh yeah it makes it a breeze uh that's that's probably one of my my favorite features um but one thing that people probably don't think too much about is is a feature like InTouch uh we we manage a lot of devices that are not peplink we manage a lot of things that we don't want online as well so in touch gives us that ability to lock into you know things that are on the other side whether that's a computer through VNC or remote desktop whether that's through you know SSH or um HTTP https devices on the other side uh that that makes a big difference for us um and and is is a feature that we and our clients and our partners use every single day it's something I learned the other day is that InTouch isn't just for networking devices you've got outer band management as well you can have serial adapters plugged in on USB that's right so you can have and you can also you can get all sorts of data out of that we can use that to get serial data out from a GPS device but also to communicate with things so we can have C like command prompt through that uh so if we have like um a scatter system so also like a uh a PLC system to control things we can remote into that we have a number of landbased clients that use it for building uh building management systems where they have uh serial control to those systems that they can loog into all sorts of stuff for irrigation plants basically it makes everything an internet of things right it means that we can suddenly interface to devices that are offline and make everything an iot device nice feature yeah absolutely cool absolutely nice so any any feature requests on the Forum that you you want to highlight where to start um I know I know I know there's been a few on the for and I know I occasionally get tagged by you as well saying what do you think of this one Adam well I need support you know we we we we can't keep on editing these things and then be like you know just complete silence but you know we we we we post a couple um I think one of our one of my big ones at the moment is I'd love to have the ability to tag a particular vanin line as being low bandwidth so for example like ban or vet so a satellite service with a low bandwidth or could also be you know an old ADSL line or you know that sort of style that is limiting bandwidth limiting throughput um that we have a preset uh amount of rules that you know on this line you know it doesn't pass Netflix and Facebook and all those kind of things but instead instead of setting up a great big long list of things that we can't do have it as a preset uh because a lot of our clients will are using these as a as a fallback um and sometimes they're unsure if all the right rules are plugged in in and uh even though we have a you know a spreadsheet of of things we normally configure this that would be the kind of feature that makes it easy for our clients to ensure that that only the data needed goes over those lines I know there was another feature we were talking about on the Forum as well which is about being able to synergize on the land side as well as on the W side so being able to pick up say the Wi-Fi radio from a HD1 Dome Pro that's right and then be able to use that as an access point and not just use it as a Wi-Fi w i mean that would be really interesting yeah well we've been talking about that for a while now I think almost two years it's been on the list of things to to to push through and not only hc1 Doms but br1 Pros mxs all sorts uh and that would mean that for example for in again in our case we could put up a one or two hc1 Doms in a mast so 25 30 m up a mast and instead of it also deploying like a a rocket access point or an outdoor access point we can use St storms instead so very useful feature for us absolutely y if if if you like any of these search on the Forum you'll find them put a comment put a like put a plus it helps Nick and I out and everyone else in the community yeah we we put the link down in the description to those um requests or we add a comment to it yeah and I think one of my one one of the new features that I haven't haven't posted yet but it's in my draft is uh the ability to select what GPS it's being used right so like I mentioned before we we some times have the ability for seven different GPS inputs for balance device but we don't actually know which one it's using and sometimes it's causing um a bit of grief and and confusion so having the ability to select which GPS is actually being used not only for tight time server and time and ntp but also in general which one is being used so we can choose the most accurate one I me that would be u a great one for us especially now again with the introduction of styling and Synergy mode we now get all these abilities to get a GPS into a device but no way of actually managing it yeah and also fail over to one another that's right and know when you fail over yeah yeah nice looking forward to that one podcast all right I think that's it for today guys thank you so much Nick a huge thank you to you as well and if you want to be a guest like Nick on the show uh let us know let us know and if you have any features that you want to highlight uh that you post on the Forum let us know in the comments down below and um yeah Nick good luck good luck on your journey and uh it was a pleasure talking to you again no thank you it was a pleasure to be on the show and uh yeah it was great chatting with you guys about peplink and what we can and what we want to do and all the exciting new things that's coming great um Adam obviously if you've got any ideas for a joke I really need help for the next episode and with that thank you so much for listening and we look forward to seeing you on episode 4 of the peplink podcast thank you guys [Music]"}

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "well today we're going to talk about in control and I think it's a really important topic when we talk about the ecosystem of peplink and what it can do and so we wanted to talk about zero touch configuration and out of band management and that's really like if we when we publish this uh these slides it needs to be zero touch out of band management because that's really what in control does for us it allows us to configure devices um 10 one 10 a thousand 10,000 without ever touching the router it also gives us the ability to manage auxiliary systems and so I'm I'm really excited to Deep dive this um give you a little tour of it but also we have a good slide back here to show you uh uh for it as well in control um this what is in control and that is an interesting question because if you come from some of these Cloud Centric worlds they might say it's an orchestrator or concentrator um really it's a cloud configurator is way I like to say it because these ideas of orchestrators or concentrators are the idea that intelligence is required in the cloud and we don't want to do that we want to be free from we want to allow Engineers or companies to choose how their Cloud benefits them and so for us in control is a centralized configuration and Reporting platform that brings the ecosystem of peplink device configuration into one simplified platform if yeah I I think that's I think you got it like you said the the cloud is helpful but it's not required right it's the configuration it's the reporting But ultimately the routers do the job themselves and so what what it does for us for Remote Management in toin device control allows us to configure devices uh routers uh switches access points and and auxiliary uh units like Sim injectors and things like that real time Diagnostics and instant issue resolution I I can't stress this enough I get I get asked all the time how do I manage so many clients as we as our company grows and as we serve a larger and larger pool of companies out there and and the answer is in control from my from my cell phone to my to my laptop my knock everything that we do is centered around in control and the ability to troubleshoot diagnose and uh solve problems in real time uh make a massive difference in how we can operate provide tech support to our customers um and then the third thing here is zero touch deployment configuration I'm going to show you all the different things that you can do with this within control that allow you to zero touch virtually every aspect of the netk of the router um remotely or without ever even logging into the router H with the exception of some Wan settings because we we need the router to get on the internet for zero touch to work so if we don't have an esm bootstrap you're going to need to program some W IP settings but outside of Wan settings all other configurations can be pushed um centrally and without touching the router and then location Mobility management so Fleet Management um and so the ability to see the GPS location of your devices where they are um manage your Fleet and and there's even more features like some of our routers even have Bluetooth capabilities built into them and crazy stuff like that and so the ability to manage your Fleet where they are geofence and set permissions and criteria based on that or repair reporting in criteria I should say yeah I think you kind of touched on it at the beginning there Peter I think the biggest deal about in contr is just how scalable it makes you right like right what what you're able to do in in your your business and for your customers but we hear that over and over again like Captain Nick said you know we're four guys and we're managing super Yachts for 250 Super Yachts from New Zealand right like yep that's incredible scalability and that's really what all these different features of in control give you oh you think about my support team what 10 10 guys supporting tens of thousands of customers at this stage in our company I I it's insane it's insane um and so there there's a couple zero touch features in in control that that we bring to the table uh we have the bulk configurator and thank you to uh uh Grant from Hyo over in Australia for giving us last week giving us a real- Time demonstration of how he uses the bolt configurator but the idea of the Vault configurator there are these little tiny nuances inside the router that you might want to just not have to worry about you just you boot up the routers they download those little tiny Nuance configurations and every router now has those settings and so you can use the bulk configurator to push configuration files of router types to all other routers of that same type so if I have a br1 and I want to push out that configuration to 20,000 v1s you can use the Bol configurator and push that out to 20,000 v1s you can then supplement or add capabilities to customize these devices that are bulk configured with the remaining things that we're going to talk about so for example Remote device IP configuration we have device IP address management capability is a CSV file in in control that will allow you to basically individualize Lan and VLAN settings even static routes and DHCP reservations in a big CSV file um for for all of your devices so you can Bol configurate them then unique assign uh device IP settings we then support bulk outbound policy configuration or like I like to say centralized outbound policy configuration the idea that you want to send some traffic to teams or Zoom to I'm sorry some teams traffic and zoom traffic out of w smooth speed Fusion tunnel or you want to send some corporate traffic over specific GRE tunnel or whatever it might be the ability to customize those outbound policies and manage them centrally and apply globally that allows you to basically hey I need to send this specific destination over a specific interface or tunnel and I don't need to log into every single router I could just change the outbound policy and all the router all the PO routers that are affected by that policy automatically get updated so there's you don't have to think about oh get them all did I miss one you know is the syntax right you know you could just make it test it configure it once then apply that configuration to all of your devices centralized firewall policy configuration this is epic when you think about zero touch and the ability to secure your infrastructure the ability to immediately respond to threat actors and different different scenarios is critical for security and and response and so what we're doing with uh the firewall policies is not only can you do zero touch firewall policies but we've added region and SAS applications to the to the rules so you can allow Microsoft Office 365 allow zoom and allow Google workspace but block bad countries that you don't want to talk to or countries outside of your own country so you can block countries allow applications and then have other firewall policies and you can push those out in seconds that's what's so cool about this is you can create a firewall policy to block a known bad IP address that's detected by your sim and push out to a thousand routers in a matter of a second and for a couple seconds and so it's a great way to centrally manage that push out and then have the audibility part of our sock compliance or hippoc compliance these different compliances that you're required to have say that you need to have audibility you need to be able to see those organizational changes and so all the changes in control are then audited and then put into the operational log then we have centralized firmware management once again part of our compliance these days is making sure we're up toate so you could push firmware to your lab devices make sure it's tested and validated then push it out to your entire organization and so the ability to to manage firmware roll back if it's a bad firmware it doesn't work um and then see the history of firmware and all their release notes all right inside in control I I want to say finally but there's two more so almost finally Wireless SSID configuration so now we can configure ssids and you can have unlimited configured ssids then push them via tag to all of your devices this is going to give you the ability to have like a a guest Wi-Fi an Enterprise Wi-Fi with with radius authentication maybe an iot Wi-Fi that's for printers and other devices um and so you can create different SSID options and then push them to your network via zero touch just with a tag and so you can say guest tag then the guest VLAN the guest wifi and the guest permissions all get pushed to every device that has the guest tag so it's a great way to um just finalize that Network management and then finally but not least is the ability to captive portals um and so managing capture portals can be a very cumbersome administrative task with in control you can create captive portals centrally and deploy them globally this allows you to have username permission like user settings or tokens or um restrictions by by domain for the the email email based authentication and push those out to thousands of routers and not have to worry about each individual router having its own set of tokens or its own set of username and passwords now you can if you want to based on tag but you don't have to this makes it really easy to deploy large scale cap Deployable environments without needing to have individualized site configurations that was a lot and it's actually not even all that's available and so I'm going to we get to the demo side I'm going to show you even a few other things that aren't as critical as these topics but go into completing the network configuration via zero touch yeah I love this because you spent all that time covering what basic is just the absolute basics of what control you know this is a we've been doing zero touch management for 15 years and so there's just tons of features in there right we could talk all hour and still not cover all all the different features but oh yeah that's the point right the tools are there and they're ready and that's what we want to be able to provide you is just access to to visibility of these tools so that you can then use your engineering brain to go oh my gosh this makes my life easier right if if these if these webinars do anything to just Empower you to make your it life easier we've done our job and um and so the idea of these webinars is just as we release new products and capabilities we're just going to talk about them again um so the the ball configurated we already talked about but it's very easy to deploy you basically configure a router click import configuration file upload a configuration file give it a name identify do you want to preserve the SSID settings pervert preserve outbound policy in the config file or let outbound policy in in control so you can uncheck that and let outbound policy override um centralized outbound policy override the configuration file preserve web admin and CLI settings on the device or let device system management override that um you can schedule or apply immediately and then you can do a tag and and apply these this configuration to um a set of devices one thing to note is this configuration of because it's a configuration file one configuration file per device type so so if you have br1 pro 5gs and br2 pro 5gs you need need two configuration files here one for the v1s one for the br2s because this is just going to push that configuration file right to the device centralized device IP settings this tab if you ever looked at it can be very daunting but it's incredibly easy and I wanted to to show this to you just in a simple case so I'm going to try to oh nope that's not going to work let me exit so centralized device IP settings I have two routers here an sdx and an mbx uh br2 and I configured them via C device IP settings so if I go to settings device IP settings there's a lot of options in this CSV file but if you look at my CSV file it's actually really simple I have my serial number my IP address of the untag land my land negotiation my VLAN ID 10 my VLAN name guest and then the guest that's it everything else about these vlans is managed under Network VLAN networks where I actually centralized oh my gosh that's not a word centrally manage all the options for those vlans so if I go to my untacked VLAN I can configure my DHCP settings my at my lease time my servers my wins my extended options so I'm using the V device network settings VLAN networks to be able to configure the actual VLAN settings and then I'm using device IP settings just to configure the Lan IP address of each VLAN it makes a very clean uh footprint here that that is very easy to read and understand copy um but also incredibly scalable this tool has just tremendous amounts of capability from static routes to dhp reservations to dhp relay server settings um and it it applies to the balance and Max and the ap1s um and so you can configure your settings very quickly and easily and have as much or as little options here as possible and you only have to import the options that apply to you what matters most with this is that the syntax of the first row or first rows if you have a bunch of them is is correct the number of commas is correct so I use Microsoft Excel save it as a CSV file and just drag it into here that way I make sure all the commas and the the rows the columns and the rows are all aligned properly but incredibly powerful easy to use and deploy IP addresses at Great scale okay so then we have centralized outbound policy centralized outbound policy allows allows you to manage the outbound policies based on tag so couple things to note there policies are applied by tag then top down so say there's a policy that applies to two routers so you have or let's say there's two policies that apply to what the same router the first policy in order on the on the outbound policy uh section is the one that's applied to the router so basically it works top down in the list of policies and the first policy that matches is the policy it's apply so if you've created a policy you're like why is that not pushing to my my device check your tag and check to see if there's another policy Above This policy that um might apply to this router then the other thing about outbound policies is that the syntax of your ws and speed fusions is very critical and it's awesome so it's it's annoying when you think about it but then awesome when I explain it to you you can create outbound policies that apply to fiber Cellular One Broadband if you don't have a w named fiber that policy is not applied so you can have one policy with kind of conflicting rules based on the different types of WS that you have and so if you have a three of your sites have a fiber internet and you want to prioritize the fiber internet for your corporate traffic and the broadband internet for your guest traffic but then you have 20 sites that are only cellular you can create an outbound policy out a rule that says fiber corporate traffic you know way fiber and then the guest traffic goes over the Broadband your cellular sites don't even get that rule because the WAN name doesn't apply so if you see that your rules are are applying but you're not the the rules are applying but the individual policies are not most likely you've there's a syntax missing so the name of your Cellular Connection doesn't match the syntax of the name of The Cellular Connection in the alal policy outside of that if you remember those those key functions very very powerful incredibly scalable um so when we go to to create outbound policies uh we can apply out outbound policies by tag then we can add rules and and so when you add a rule you can enable the device and you can actually enable this div uh policy by always on or by schedule and so you can create centrally managed schedules these are all those little features right you can create centrally managed schedules like work hours and then you can create policies that only apply during work hours or outside of work hours are only on the weekends so you can have policies that are applicable at certain times of the day then you choose your Source your destination your protocol and then your algorithm I believe yeah there we go so we have all these algorithms I'll show that to you in a second then once you do that you can configure how you want this to be pushed by your Wan connection name or speed Fusion connection name um and then and what do you want to do if this rule doesn't apply drop the traffic fail through the next rule or terminate um uh yeah or find any connection so we have eight load balancing rules a weighted balance which basically allows you to distribute traffic based on a weight a weighted distribution so for every 10 if you had a like a fiber connection you said 10 and you had a broadband connection you said two then for every 12 packets 10 are going to go over the fiber two are going to go over the Broadband then we have persistence persistence says once I establish a connection stay there until that session is terminated or the WAN is terminated then we have enforced say go out this W no matter what and by the way we have a whole whole webinar just on outbound policies I'm just kind of giving you a very quick breakdown priority says use these and Order of priority overflow says use it till it's full then overflow to the next one use it till it's full and overflow to the next one least used is you can either buy download or upload and it's basically says you use whichever internet connection is available that is being used the least lowest latency every 15 seconds it checks the latency to the third hop of that Wan and then uses that Wan so that's the lowest latency Wan fastest response time sends an AK out all of your WS the first one to respond with the SN is the W that is used so it's I use this when I'm doing bgp because I have the same IP address so it doesn't really matter if I flip-flop every session is fastest response for me centralized firewall policies centralized firewall policies work very similar to outbound policies ex except for control of the security aspect of it so uh we can add rules apply them by yes sweet we can apply them by tag and then we get to come in here and we can choose we have um outbound firewall rules inbound firewall rules internal Network rules in other words between your vlans and your VIN users and your speed Fusion tunnels and then internal system rules which actually control how the router is allowed to be accessed so if you want to restrict the management of the router to a specific VLAN or spe specific Source IP address or Access Control list you can do that right here inside the internal system rules then we have content blocking okay I'm G do content blocking then we have content blocking where you can do application based and URL based blocking so block Facebook block Hulu block adaware and viruses things like that um and so people come to us all the time and they they ask us about the security footprint of peplink and as you can see with the ability to do outbound policies by region SAS client type inbound firewall rules um and then the ability to do our content blocking with DPI layer 7 capabilities application capability and content blocking zero subscription it's going to function um very well and adds a lot of functions and features to your to your network but more importantly if you have a threat that's detected you can block something here and immediately block it globally you don't have to log into all your routers you don't have to wait for it to to SK up I I've seen customers push router changes to take 15 minutes to to process this takes like a couple seconds um and so we can we can push changes very very quickly um to a lot of routers with within control yeah and I know you've got another video showing you know you talked about it before but with the API integration how powerful that is being able to scale like a real time update to thousands of routers with with really no work right you just get that front end connection going and everything takes the the updates as they as they get pushed through exactly and what's really nice about the outbound policies and the the the firewall policies is one they deploy quickly two the extra features we get from in control like SAS and regen add extra value to that in control platform where these databases can be updated dynamically and pushed down to your routers so the ability to manage centrally but also gain access to extra databases creates a little extra value that in control brings to the table yeah we've got all these realtime signatures for different popular applications like you said the different regions and countries and so those are used usable in firewall policies they're usable in routing policies they're usable all over the place in the system but again they're they're right there ready to be used so you can streamline that workflow and then we have centralized firmware management so in with centralized firmware management we can have like a lab environment test and pro you know make sure firmware meets our our needs and and works with our Network and then we can push these out to all of our devices and you can actually push out firmware based on three different options um you can push firmware immediately you can push firmware with a schedule or with a geofence so say you have a fleet of 200 police cars or buses and you want to schedule firmware updates at midnight but some of those Vehicles might be out the road and you don't want to shut off the internet uh for those police cars or buses you can actually do region create a Geo fence around your Depot and then basically say hey I want to push this latest firmware but only do it when you reach the depot so you put a little a little G geofence around the the depot when they pull into the depot it downloads the firmware updates and reboots and so you're not accidentally pushing firmware while a vehicle or Mission critical operation is occurring out in the field it's a great feature that just offers enhanced security and capabilities yeah fir firmware updates are just such a refreshing tool in this in this system because you know if you've managed other devices and systems over the years like pushing firmware out remotely can be a really like scary task because you just don't know are these things going to come back right and you know number one within control they're going to come back right we've been doing this for 15 years thousands and thousands of routers at at once but on top of that you've got all these granular controls like you said to control the schedule of when it happens or even the location of where it happens and yeah that just makes it even more reliable for you to deploy it scale and be be confident that you're not going to have to go out to these routers at some point another cool thing about just because you said it but cool thing about peplink is one there's two copies of every firmware so you can roll back um and it's actually an option now inside this drop down list right here it says follow Group Policy when you push a firmware there's actually very bottom it says fail back to the previous and it it disables firmware management and then reboots into the previous firmware so if there is a problem with the current firmware it'll reboot but if there's a corruption in the current firmware it can load that backup firmware and then further say you push a configuration that takes the router offline after 15 minutes it'll actually revert its last configuration and there'll be a little red triangle it says configuration fail and say hey whatever you've done that that took this router offline you might want to check their settings um so we've it's not perfect but man it I mean I'd say 80 85% of the time it can recover actually a no internet connection solution um and with 8.5.1 I don't know if you read read the beta notes we now have the ability to fail over APNs so if someone types an APN wrong and it takes a SIM card offline you can now it'll remember the previous APN and apply that just see if it worked not guaranteed but the idea is if you misconfigure the router it's going to try to recover itself the best it can and I just I find that very cool that they add those features with centralized SSID options there are a lot of Wireless options here but basically you can have virtually unlimited ssids apply them by tag to devices and most their devices support either four or 16 SSID simultaneously and so you can have guest Wi-Fi iot Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi you can have your Enterprise Wi-Fi with wpa3 Enterprise um and so you can configure all these options centrally um we support faster transition um Wi-Fi radio settings where you can set the client signal strength to to help handoff between APS um all of that can be pushed centrally to help with Wi-Fi performance and mitigation and funny thing is the AP1 ax the AP that peplink uses it's so easy just to plug that thing in turn it on and it works I've been playing with a friend of mine on Wi-Fi optimization and so typically I was seeing like 200 to 400 me megabits per second of Internet on my Wi-Fi AP and I always thought that was pretty good I was like okay it's not bad well since I've started using the Wi-Fi radio options to to transition devices over and then set the power as low as possible to cover a specific area and my house to walk around or my building I'm now seeing like 700 800 900 megabits of of Wi-Fi performance because I'm not overlapping the channels right that I'm only covering an area and then as I leave that area I'm grabbing onto another AP so try to Broad broadcasting and spanning my my area with a lot of Wi-Fi and hoping that something connects I'm fine-tuning my Wi-Fi based on coverage areas and I'm seeing incredible throughput on these AXS that have been around for a while that I didn't even know could handle that amount of throughput so Wi-Fi configuration and control and being able to centrally manage that and push those settings out is is has changed my life as far as Wireless optimization is concerned yeah there's just a whole Treasure Trove of Wireless configuration options inside and control and in the the routers themselves so you just just about any Wi-Fi scenario you can think of there's Tools in there to deal with that and it's easy to push out of course it's yeah right so this is just showing you simply adding an SSID you can set your SSID you can enable it you can actually have you know assign it by tag we also have scheduling so when when we talk about scheduling you can create a schedule and apply that to the ssids as well um you can block land access you can block VPN access a pep VPN access um there's a built-in little firewall where you can restrict networks um and so let me see if it okay so there's a there's a lot of options in the SSID that allow you to secure lock down or Andor just allow traffic through at the SSID level blocking it before you even hit your network captive portals um captive portals can be applied to the SSID or a VLAN if you apply it to an SSID with a with a compatible router firmware um it will only protect it at the Wi-Fi level so say you have a guest network but you have or you want to do a capture portal on your Wi-Fi network but you want to allow printers and other devices on that same network via Ethernet that don't require capture portal you can capture portal just the SSID not the VLAN and that way if you plug ether into that VLAN you you don't have a captive portal but if you're Wireless on that VLAN you do have a captive portal um so two places you can assign the capture portal uh you create a capture portal and then you can configure options and these options are available to everybody that has in control and or even just your local router so you have social Open Access guest access token which generates a list of token you can generate like 20,000 tokens put it into your mail merge it with your CSV or put it into your and then print them with a receipt or put them on a name badge and give people tokens um you could do email and you can even restrict email by domain and this is kind of cool I had a customer that wanted kind of like a two-factor authentication on the Wi-Fi so what we did is a captive portal by email domain then we restricted the email domain to only their Corporate email domain so for me you know say peplink university.com you log in if you don't have access to a peplink university.com email address you can't get on the the Wi-Fi and so you can actually restrict it and then it basically let you online let you download that get that key you got you get two minutes or something like that you can get in check your email and then you can um put in that token and then that gives you the ability to connect in so it lets you uh restrict users by email domain which is kind of cool and then SMS and there's a lot of features you can customize the logo the terms of use um where you're redirecting to after you're done um and so it's it's a great great tool for you know uh lands Wi-Fi and VLS for you know adding that captive portal right to your network yeah and just just like everything that we've been talking about this is so scalable you you we've got customers just with massive Transportation agencies that have this captive portal solution deployed you know tens of thousands of users a day this is all Built For Speed so you can you can deploy this for your little coffee shop or again a absolute massive Metro Transit organization yeah and it's you can figure it once and it's out on all of them so here's sort of like customizing the portal you change the colors change the text the background image the logo that kind of stuff full router access with or without a prescription subscription so we talked about all these cool zero touch things I think in a world where everybody's moving to a subscription I love that peplink has gone this direction you can use our routers and all of their features with or without in control or a warranty so if you say hey I'm I'm anti Cloud not a problem by the routers everything that we've shown you with the exception of the SAS and regions is available um on the local device the the the Wi-Fi management uh firewall policy in control policies outbound policies speed Fusion configuration everything can be done uh with or without a subscription uh with the exception of SASS and region th those things do require in control um and then you can even use our API if you Google B peplink balance API you can make your own programmatic uh tool to interact with these routers so you can download the the peplink balance API or the in control API and so you can actually interact and programmatically configure these devices with your own tool sets or integrating into your own platforms um making them incredible once again that scalability just brings that scalability through the roof um as far as what you can do with the technology yeah I think like you said at the beginning in control is a tool for device configuration and Reporting and it's not a required tool right you can log into the router and you can configure it that way too right it's going to be a lot less scalable in most cases but that's your choice right it's it's not a requirement it's not forced on you and most people definitely see the value in it and choose to subscribe but yeah you don't have to so I've had customers say Pete this sounds great our security compliance says no way are we allowed to use a cloud tool but we love the idea in control peplink has a solution for you with that as well the in control virtual Appliance is a virtual appliance that you can purchase it is a purchase um and then you would Deploy on your premise then you can use in control the public in control add all of your serial numbers so you own own them and then redirect to your private in control instance this allows you to have still have zero touch Factory res the router reboot router serial number phones home to peplink it says oh they have a private in control instance redirect to this IP address and then they can download their configurations um but the idea here is that you can fully manage your network without any Cloud access if you have a completely closed Network in control virtual Appliance is the way to go or you have your own SSO that you want to integrate with um once again and control virtual Appliance U has all the same features but you host it yourself yeah there's lots of reasons to deploy a management system privately and different customers have different reasons for that but um you know some of them it's just for data retention and data privacy right they don't want somebody else to have access to their customer's data that's that's perfectly valid you can run this on your servers and you have control over those databases and and who can see them and and that's great others it's really about security and making sure that there's no external threats and so the in control virtual Appliance you can run fully air gapped it never has to talk to the internet you can do offline licensing sync again like you said Peter there there's no feature Gap here it's it's the same exact user experience all the same features but you can run it privately either in your own data center or on AWS goov Cloud Google Cloud there's lots of ways that you can run this privately and again check that box for for whatever scenarios you or your customers may need definitely so we talk about this zero touch but then you go what if I have other devices like I've got some Legacy Cisco well not legacy that's an insult to our Cisco people we have Cisco switches or or we have IP phones IP cameras nvrs things like that and I would love to be able to manage those in one platform with in control and our sfc regional uh bonding solution you can out of band manage virtually any device that's connected to a peplink connect enabled Network and this could be done on the router the switch or the AP so you could buy our APS throw them out in a network and have outof band management um to any to to to that Network um same with our switches with multiple VLS and things like that so basically if it has access you can use in touch in touch is really cool and easy let me see if there's another slide for this nope there's not okay so InTouch you can add USB serial connectors and actually um use rs232 so you can buy a 16 port or eight Port star tech Industrial rs232 serial port and actually plug in 16 uh Cisco switches right to the and then manage them all with an InTouch um you can then do RS um let say it's HT TTP https SSH telnet RDP VNC rs232 and 485 and 485 zero extra cost it does require in control and an active Prime care warranty so you need the warranty but if you're using open gear or any other platform this basically offers you that if you're using peplink and have in control already it's free uh no extra licensing fees so it's incredibly powerful yeah there's lots of reasons that people choose to subscribe or renew their in control or renew their Prime Care and InTouch is one of those things that you know if you're using it it costs the the the value you get from in touch is is hard to replace for the cost of that in control subscription like you will pay more for a Remote Management solution outside of in control so if that's to you you've you've got it free already and you don't even need to think about that right that's one less thing you have to go buy exactly manage and set up so we just talked about a lot of stuff and you might go man Pete that's awesome how do I do this take your phone real quick scan that QR code um and we have a handbook um so a guide on pep Link's uh website that will actually step you through some of these things how to configure these different tools um under peplink university on my YouTube channel I also have a a video about in control and each of the settings and where they are um but yeah you can scan that QR code um and access this in control handbook yeah there's tons of different howt inside of there and we'll we'll keep adding more to that Library yeah lots of great kind of self-served content yeah so I'll kind of show you that real fast so here's the how-to handbook I'm sure you could just Google peplink how-to handbook and it's going to show up um and you can see device setup in control um functions of in control and we'll add a link to this on peplink university.com as well just so that it's in more than one location but you could see all of uh all this information is very nice and easy so there's a couple things that we didn't cover in the slides that are these extra nuances and I just wanted to show them to you because I do have a few more minutes um so we talked about Wi-Fi we talked about bound policy firewall policy but if you look at that I actually have a lot more options here so grouped networks this is groups of IP addresses or or with 8.5.1 so it's not available now but with 8.5.1 groups of URLs so you can create firewall policies and outbound policies and apply grouped networks which could be groups of ips and or URLs um to those rules um so if you have a list of servers or list of URLs that you want to block you could block URLs you can have a blocked URLs list and then add it to your firewall rule you can also um add group networks for internal access and things like that so you can access those those or traffic shape like outbound policy these are my internal URLs send those over speed fusion and keep them inside my network um Access Control list is a group of is a is groups of Mac addresses so you can have like a list of company laptops that are allowed to access a group of servers so allow access list laptops to servers and that can be applied at the firewall level or you could say these laptops can talk over speed fusion and send these access controllers this iot devices send that traffic over this particular speed Fusion tunnel so you can do use those those tools that way VLAN networks allows you to push vlans um to your devices this that allows for ecosystem so uh routers switches and APS if you're doing like a guest Wi-Fi can create VLAN 10 for my guest Wi-Fi and then push it to my router my switch and my AP and this way I can trunk through the network seamlessly so I don't need to log into every single switch and add VL 10 I can add it once and get it pushed through the entire ecosystem Lan network settings allows you to add bonjour and static routes and things like that uh right centrally managed and you can apply these by tag by the way so you can you know well some rouers might have a different configuration you can apply apply that via tag route advertisement OPF bgp rip uh captive portal and then connection test connection test lets you schedule connection test speed tests so you could say hey every morning at 7 AM check my internet if it's less than 500 megabits per second fail the test and then you can get a connection test report that says you failed um Client List let you see all the clients and then under settings we have a lot of options here to help with Device configuration and compliance so we talked about device IP settings device system management configures everything about the devices admin settings SNMP um net flow uh URL logging session logging system logs or event logs where those go sending them to your sim or your logging servers um certificate management let you pushes push out certificates in control options that you configure how often and how much data in control is allowed to consume notifications that you set up alerts that could be either email or even API like push it to your um your ticketing system um report emailing you can generate week daily weekly and monthly reports about everything happening inside in control we talked about firmware policy device schedules this that you create schedules that can be applied to all of those rules and services um centrally so you can create work hours weekend hours holiday hours you can create these different schedules and then apply those to different um services that allow you to use schedule Geo fencing let you set up Geo fences uh by either a lined area a circle um and so you can set those up and then apply policies like turn the Wi-Fi off when you pull into the depot allow firmware management when you pull into this location tag it deployed when you leave an area so if I leave the city of Gainesville where deployed we're out in the field right um bulk configurator this is where you're going to upload those configuration files Docker management is now centrally managed add delivery service if you won't see that unless you have a specific uh feature enabled but add delivery service group settings so users and password like not passwords but users and time zone uh address locate default address and then operational log this is really important for anybody that's on here that's security conscious you can click this operational log and literally see everything that everyone is doing in your in control organization or group and um and they have this the group level and at the organizational level um and this helps you with your your CL compliances right a lot of compliances in these days need to see logs and have audibility um the operat log let you do that um and then finally seeing that log on the screen Peter is that you don't have that no I just see the IP settings right now I click it did you see that yes Co okay so yeah and you could see here you know Peter disabled you could see I was messing around with outbound policy see outbound policy outbound policy so I was playing around with outbound policies early today and you can see those Peter West modifying outbound policies right there um so uh the operational log is really powerful then we have reports uh we have device reports why Wii reports usage reports SIM card reports captive portal dashboard captive portal reports connection test reports event log and tags so it's too much to go into in one small episode here but I wanted to show you just like there's zero touch and then there's everything else and all those little tiny everything else's is what makes it control so powerful yeah those are all things that are there because people with real deployments needed them those are tools that were requested over the years and so those are things again you get to stand on the on the shoulders of everybody else's efforts there because it's all set up and ready to go yeah um and so I've got a couple minutes I'm going to go over some questions someone said uh should I'm able to access network settings for ubr LTE yes uh you should be able to access network settings if you have a peplink router um as uh in in a group that's that's active I mean if the warranty's expired your added it it might not show up but if you have a active router with with modern firmware and you've added it to a group you should see network settings yep you may not see those until it phones home the first time it's brand new device it may not show yet oh this a good question is there plan to support Port foring so right now in control isn't as you notice we don't have any Wan settings so because port for and things like that are typically uh per device like more in the data center or headquarters office I I don't know if port foring and Wan configuration options are are on the public road map for in control I don't know if Travis wants to say any more to that but I believe Wan settings server settings Port foring those are really kind of unique to a specific headquarter um whereas bulk configuration of Port foring rules doesn't typically apply but if you had some that you needed to you could use the bulk configurator and that would allow you to bulk configurate uh port for ruls yeah the inbound stuff is like you said generally more of like a device specific topic but um yeah if there's ideas on that we're definitely all ears to hear about that right they're correct right now that's not present in there yeah admin to reach that or or the device the ball configurator but yeah it's really kind of a single router item often we don't have IPS but we do have IDs and dos prevention um so you can enable that in the our firewall settings someone just ask that IPS I just wanted to to add that there um is a way to configure MFA so we don't have MFA on the router um but we do have MFA in in control so um if you click on your email address in the top right of in control you can um configure MFA or if you go to the organization level that this peplink University and you go to organization settings you can push MFA as a force to two-factor authentication all users or only administrators so or only super administrators so you could do all administrators or super ad uh super administrators um for for MFA uh so that would be the the the best way to configure MFA for frame control but the router itself technically if you used radius or tackx and that had MFA right so if you did radius to your to your domain controller and then you used MFA like U duo with with uh radius you could MFA the routers um web admin and that would be on the web admin settings and then you would so under uh let me go back so if you go to device device system management it's more of an advanced feature but you can choose radius here put in your radius settings and then integrate duo or some MFA solution into your active directory and then that would restrict uh to uh your router login uh with MFA uh client signals threshold is already configured supported in um uh in control so under Wi-Fi group radio settings you can right here you can you can configure the um signal threshold right here um this is actually how we handle really good uh fast transition so a lot of times I'll say you know set it to negative 71 DB and this way if you have overlapping this is like I talking about earlier at my house and my company uh my office we set a signal strength here this way as you're roaming around you're not your devices aren't holding on to an AP when there's a better AP nearby as you roam around fast transition is going to kick you over where this m the minimum signal strength is going to assist in kind of motivating your device to move over to a better AP um are you going to add Wi-Fi settings to use ofdm to kill DSS rates there's too many acronyms I don't know what they mean um Travis I don't know if you know that one yeah there's some specific channel settings there no there's no no specific plans there um I guess that's a feature request you could put in on the Forum but yeah yeah you can click the Fe feedback or the feature request and get that add no that would be not feedback that would be a feature request on the forums because that's specific to the hardware um VW uh if you have a prim care device somebody asked if the VW still requires a subscription if you have a Prime Care device you get one VW virtual Wan for free um as long as it stays under Prime Care and then um or you can perpetually purchase a VW license and then it's there forever so um VW is um and you can buy either one two or three on the smaller routers and then 10 25 and 40 for the larger routers like the sdx andx those are onetime feature activations not subscriptions some someone ask is there a good way to manage users across IC orgs uh currently no um all I could suggest is feedback um Andor um there's not like an MSP user manager um I don't know about you but on mine and I can't show it because of security but if I go to my my I incontrol 2. pink.com and I scroll all the way to the bottom underneath all my Orcs I can download a list of those users and so when I'm doing audits of my employee access I download that I can see the users that have access to Orcs that I manage um so that would be my only recommendation there I I can't show it here because uh I need to stay inside peplink University but uh you could try that give that a shot um can you share the differ between zero touch features of in control so um this person asked if we can the organization level versus group level on the organization level you're going to have organization wide configuration options um peplink has added Wi-Fi so you're going to have reports speed Fusion VPN so that's GNA allow you to VPN between uh groups um you can now do organization wide Wi-Fi which is new and awesome and then you have your organization settings like device management creating groups um device a organizational level firmware policy so so if you want to test in a lab your firmware then then push it at the organization hey this is our our default standard firmware for the org um you can push at the org level and then at the group level override the org level for lab testing and things like that you have your operational log at the org level so that shows every single group and then your organizational settings which lets you configure tenant settings like or org admins um multiactor out authentication things like that that are there be at the or level so how can you zero touch to power cycle a a device so there's a couple ways to do that and then I think I'm gonna have to stop unless you guys want me to stay on but um so if I go to my fleet I can click edit to to this list select a router like the rebel go to actions and I can actually reboot the device right here and I could do all of them so if I wanted to reboot all of these devices I could do it right from here so I can actually restore to factory I can actually reset them to factory defaults and when I do my my zero touch config demo I that's actually one of the things that I do and then you can out and then you can also remote reboot who's M I swear reboot was on that list I was looking too okay uh well I thought it was there I me I'll show you the different way to do it the alternative way to do it is go to device settings device tools I know this one's here because I did this for somebody today yeah and you have uh reboot and restore we we should click the feedback and see if we can get reboot back on that um so you can reboot a device and then if you needed to reboot a modem um like the actual cellular modem that is not doable inside in control yet you'd want to go into the device web admin so remote web admin and then you can actually reset the modem so if you like say your carer says Hey reboot your modem you don't want to reboot through the whole device um you can actually go into device go into remote web admin of the router click on your cellular device that you want to reboot so like this cellular one and then click the question mark under cellular settings reset this cellular module and that'll just reboot just the module so if your ISP or your carrier says reboot the mo module and you don't want to reboot the whole device um you can do it right there so uh is there a way to reboot shut down a port on a Cisco switch yes so using InTouch um you can log into your Cisco switch and then shut down the the switch Port um so you could use SSH telet or web um https to do that um so if I go to the summit I think I have an InTouch assuming my IP addresses didn't change so I have 24 Port switch web and SSH if my IP change this won't work so this is what set up for a demo we'll see if this this works or not oh my IP changed sorry we I had that set up for the summit last week but anyways yeah so you can see right here this my my devices so my sim injector I can SSH into the switch web access into the switch um and so you can just click on that SSH and then you have that full tell net or SSH or web access to the switch and then you can reboots and close ports and things like that got two more questions I'll go ahead and knock these out real fast um will router port settings becoming to ic2 I.E be able to access that's already available uh for settings are already available in in control so if you pull up a switch um so when you pouter port oh oh oh router port settings okay the land ports on yeah so we could do it on the switch so I don't see why we couldn't do it on the router uh we'd have to do a feedback or feature request but it's support it and some don't is the the backstory on that so um higher-end routers yeah you'll see that on there the lower-end routers um some of them you'll see the port status some of them there's varying levels of configuration you can do on I think it depends on the switch that's that's uh built the the switch chipset of the router like what features that supports exactly but yeah you can always push the feedback button and request it if it's not showing up but step one make sure you're on the current firmware because that has improved on some of the models but but I know it's not in there for all of them still too so uh somebody asked if you could turn on location for Max 700 one I applaud you uh for still having a Max 700 that's awesome it's one of my first routers uh that I used in the field two uh no uh so so the the back 700 is USB ports uh for internet instead of the integrated cellular modems the GPS comes from the integrated cellular modems so you'd basically have to either hook up a starlink that gives you GPS or synergize like a b B1 so like if you had your your 700 and You' got a B1 5G you could synergize that on the WAN Port that's going to bring that cellular modem down and give you GPS but you you'd have to bring some some GPS feed into it it's not going to have it by default but awesome for having a Max 700 that's get it off your starlink ethernet Wan as well if you had a star plug into it but yeah GPS yep oh is there way to have a schedule that will reboot shutdown a port switch no not within peplink right because we can't you'd have to you'd have to have a basically a script you what you what you could do and I've actually seen this and uh Grant from Hyer one of these Docker guys or talked to Matthew one of my guys you could set up a Docker image right and then have it schedule um by pushing SSH um but no not not in inside in control you're not going to be able to schedule schedule SSH uh commands is what basically what you would need is to run a command based on a schedule so okay well I we answered all the questions or almost all of them which is a first for us I know we went over but I was late so I I would say it's a win-win um thank you so much for hanging out and sticking around I see we still have quite a few people on thank you so much I I really enjoy doing these webinars Travis thank you um I love doing them from random gas stations as I travel around so that's always fun as well um you're the best testate to what you can do on the road with speed Fusion I love it Peter so you guys have a great day I'm off to Dallas Texas I'm going to Dallas right now in the very first flight on our private airplane so I'm flying myself to Dallas Texas today that's gonna be really exciting yeah so that's gonna be exciting have a great day everybody bye take care folks"}

"recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "[Music] Joey it's time for another podcast yes Adam happy to be here so this is episode two of the podcast we've been speaking about things again that are interesting us about the peplink and the peplink community and world and uh should we just jump straight in with something well let's let's jump right in there um we're going to talk about with the Ping stories we have a really special story is going to be about in control and we going to take everyone here into a space mission reping do we a space mission I think it's more a history Mission isn't it you can be a space mission if you want well we we're certainly going interplanetary uh I don't need I interplanetary we're definitely going planetary yes yes we do so yeah I I think most of the people know in control but for those who don't know control is the cloud management platform for peplink where you can manage all your peplink devices that have a network connection uh we talking not only about routers but we talking about switches access points and all of those things so yeah really excited to start talking about in control and yeah it is it it pretty much lets us control the whole peplink ecosystem doesn't it something I mean it's not unique to peplink but there's certainly not many vendors out there that have a complete solution like in control and we were very lucky the other day you and I got to speak to Michael Chan who is I I think he was there at the very start of peplink and certainly the start of Inc control we asked him a few questions about the history of in control where it was where it is now and where it's going yes yeah really excited and some really good information as well uh really really happy that he was able to answer our questions and he would like to I think the first question that I asked him I was really interested with was was there an in control one yes because there is an in control two right the name is in control to impes there to be a one and there was there was an in control one Pats didn't have well it didn't have as many features and by the sounds of things it was more of a reporting tool where you could see what was going on with your peplink rather than being able to make changes to your peplink and influence what was going on yes yes correctly so it wasn't soon before they developed a new version of in control yes so was like you said no real um management possibilities now you can go into the remote web admin from in control and um this really helps out to be able to see what's going on locally on the device but also you can now push feland uh Al policies cat portal you can push um so many other things like land settings and stuff like that you you don't need to be there on the device anymore you can practically everything I think except quality of service stuff but that is something that we come back on later but the quality of service so is the only thing I'm still doing locally on the rout everything else is is almost all doable via in control really good should we should we start on your space mission then yes we know that in control is each instance is named after a different planet yes and my next question to him is what are the different planets what are they named after and we know about Mars and we know about Earth cuz those are the two that if you create your own in control instance you either put on Earth or Mars aren't you yes so Earth is a like the the most stable version and doesn't and does get the updates at at the last time so they update Mars first before they do Earth but before we get into Mars there's a Planet before that if we going towards the Sun and that will be Venus and Venus what do we use Venus for Joey well Venus is the one that we do or peping does all the testing in so Venus is just a a kind of a um beta version of in control that you have everything everything will be added to the Venus version even pink uses that nowadays for testing out certain stuff on the in control page it's also accessible to some Partners as well is isn't it so there's some partners that also use Venus yes yeah there's there's a you you can request this um via your reseller or your distributor if if you really want to there's of course a business case needed for it but there is on request it's worth pointing out it's definitely not to be used for production because these are where things are tried out things are tested and you can expect things to go wrong there will be times where they'll put an update on there and it needs further development yes correct yes there is there is sometimes that of course they they have they will not break it on purpose but there will be stuff added that might be of any in interference of the the live environment of Venus but doesn't affect Earth or Mars in any way and then if we go to the other end of the solar system we arrive at Pluto yes so this is something that I didn't know and something I was told and In fairness it actually doesn't exist anymore a bit like Pluto is no longer considered a planet is it it's it's it's like a meteorite or something I don't know it's some silly thing but Pluto used to be used as the real development platform for the peping engineers themselves and more recently they've got rid of the Pluto in control and they are now using Venus the same as uh the partners yes yeah so uh yeah they use Pluto as a like a all stage of in control absolutely fascinating what else did he tell us Joey well staying at at fenus the there there's a maximum of course of devices you can add to Venus because like we said it's not a live uh or it should be not used as a production version of in control so there was a maximum of 50 devices that are either online or offline so that's really the limit so that's also good to know I think definitely we also asked him some of his favorite features about in control and apart from him saying that everything because he was he was very adamant that everything on um in control is absolutely amazing the two that really stood out for him was in touch so perhaps you like to tell us a bit about the in touch on in control yeah the the InTouch is it's really nice feature and I like it so much because you if keep it within ping uh the Sim injector if you want to look reach that locally there's no web admin uh feature for that yet I don't know if there will be any but uh of course they're always looking to improve and this could be it for the Sim injector part but it doesn't it does have a web admin so you can go into in touch add it as a uh InTouch feature and then connect to it viat its IP address in the land of the router that you are managing it does need to be a client into the router of course but you can still log in with your local details and still use it as a remote web pmin so it's a really really nice feature really it's a really useful feature it's it's gets round not having to have a static IP address because you can access those devices without having to have a static IP address or even having a bunch of static IP addresses because you got lots of things on the same uh Port you could have lots of devices like cameras and things like that on your local area network um which is really good there's another feature as well which is find my pep link which is a bit like a well it's a Dynamic DNS it allows the if if you have a public IP address on the peplink you can use find my peplink to convert that IP address into a DNS name but that's still not as powerful as in touch in touch is something special yes and also for in touch you don't need to put any forward rules or server rules in in there as well you just don't need to to open it in touch does at all for you yeah maybe we should do a separate video at some point just about in touch cuz it's it is something very powerful I think that'd be very useful and the other feature he told me about that he really likes which is something I didn't know you could do is you can have custom icons for your devices that you can upload and not only just one icon for a device you can have an offline and an online version of that icon for your device but you already knew this didn't you Joey yeah yes yeah I I knew I knew that well 50% of it to be honest um I knew that you could change the icon I didn't know there was an offline and an online version and also you can just upload your own uh picture of it so you can uploads a picture for online and you can upload a picture for offline devices so that's quite interesting it's really good and then I also asked him is there going to be an ic3 is there an in control 3 on the horizon and I think there was a resounding no there isn't there's nothing coming after ic3 because ic2 isn't finished yet there's so much more still to develop on ic2 and just watch this space really there's certainly a lot coming uh especially every time a new firmware comes out and you know you and I love things about firmwares but let's not let's not make this episode about a firmware um every time a new item comes out on a firmware there has to be something on in control to make that work as well looking at the RO I'm really excited about the future of in control I think there's a lot more that it's going to do and what it can do now is just amazing yeah that's correct and um yeah I also like the the comments that also highlights about features with private in control or in control virtual appliance which is a privately hosted in control version and then the the funny thing is that it's it's getting the same updates why would we use a private in control over uh pep links in control really special project where you are really concerned about data where it's store it uh you want to be in your own control of that um so the last thing that we share that so so the last thing that we asked uh Michael was about the tips and tricks so um yeah I think uh do you want to cover this one uh if I had the right screen open I would absolutely go through it sounds like you have the screen open so Joey please take it away and give us these all right so Michael showed also with us the uh tips and tricks that he has for in control so there are some some less known features that he mentioned uh and and maybe not everyone wants to or needs to use them but uh the AWS Transit Gateway integration um like like that's really an uncoming feature and to be honest I have no idea what us do you have any idea oh this is why you wanted me to talk about it yes exactly okay I I believe it's an Interlink so it will allow you to connect your pep link straight to Amazon web services but that surely would be a fusion not a fusion a a a speed Fusion feature really but I don't know maybe we should do some more research before we start telling them about these tips and tricks yes correct look Joey the easiest way right you don't know I don't know I think we just invite everyone if you know can you just put in the comments underneath so that Joey and I can be educated as to why that's a really good thing how it works and why it's important yes a really good one and maybe we highlight that in the next episode yes if somebody can explain it to us may may maybe you'll be a guest on the next episode if you can explain to us yes indeed and any more tips and tricks there Joey yeah so looking for theeast um we already discussed the the upload for custom map markers um I I do like the thing as well where they go into um into for the next next ones that I think are really important as well that they are also be extending the uh hourly users reporting so in instead of having 24 hours SS really good yeah so so instead of having 24 hours um they can go up to one month on hourly um basis so so that's really really cool because that allows you to look back in time way further than just another day and uh the daily usage reports will be extended as well if if they get it to work of course and it's Al all subject to change but so it will be extended from 45 days till 3 months so you can look back through three months so so that's really good for a day-to-day basis so what did it do on that day two and a half months ago that's a really really nice feature and let's just be really clear about this this is features that they're working on now and looking at this isn't available in any control yet it's not in Venus yet but is something they're actively looking at is increasing the length of time those reports can be viewed for yes now really really EXC I'm looking forward to that that'll be really useful to us yes all right um yeah I think this was really great and I really want to thank Michael for taking time for us to answer the questions as well and um yeah definitely thank you Michael so Joey next section is going to be tips and tricks yes have we actually thought of a better name for it yet are we just going to stick with tips and chicks by Adam and Joey tips and chicks or tips and tricks tips and tricks no tips and tricks by Adam and Joey okay okay tips and tips and trick by Adam and Jerry I I like it because we are all about finding out the new stuff and and finding out simple things that could help uh everybody out so I think tips and tricks is the best one um so let's get into it so what's the first one we're going to speak about Joey connecting your starlink to your max HD1 Dome Pro so you want you can connect this directly VI switch with the feature of virtual when so virtual when allows you to create a w port on a Lamport and as you can show Adam the HD1 Dome pro has no weport it does have two lamp ports via splitter but there's only one Lamport on the Dome and with virtual when you can do fand tagging on the switch you can still add the starlink as a one to your H1 Dome so you don't need to have another router to manage the starlink for you so you can have a solution that is really clean and really simple this is this this is really good there's another hidden benefit of that as well because it was always very hard to install an eim onto the max HD1 doome because you had to have that initial second internet connection to make it work but now that you can switch up that lamp port to have a virtual one that allows you to have that second internet connection to install that e in yes amazing feature yeah it is really nice and uh we will put a link down into the forum post where everything is ready for you to with pictures and everything so that will really help uh everyone out definitely it's a very easy thing to do as well next one I've got on here is throttle bandwidth for captive portal users yes I mean this is something that's always evolved with peplink anyway is the captive portal and it's included no extra charge it is part of the solution out the box unlike other captive portals that you have to pay for well you need to have an if you want to use this particular feature it's on a in control version of C portal so you need to have an in control license where you need to have the device online an in control to be able to push the capture Portal from the in control server to your device so yes you don't need to have an extra license to use a cat portal but you still need to have everything in control and doesn't have everything in in control right well there you go so what does this let us do then well you can after the period of time you can you can set a date like a Time based connection to your C portal so you can either set it as a Time based or usage based but you can also select time and usage based this gives you time for example 1,000 minutes of connection time to your C portal and you can also set a maximum amount of daily quota on data usage and if you if your user then has reached that limitation of the data you can throttle it down the bandwidth to a specific uh kilobits per second so that kilobits per second gives you also the flexibility to create a like I want to lower the data consumption for the users because I need to pay a lot of Euros or dollars or Pounds to to keep that connection alive it's a very expensive one I want to limit the users to be able to connect to a still fast connection but I want to limit them on how much they're using let's say you're using installing uh if you go on to the open C you need to have that priority data you don't want to have one user consume all the data but you also don't want to have that user have no internet connection at all so you can set it on for example 5 gig a day and then if you hit at 5 gigabytes of data then it throttles you down to a specific amount of kilobytes per second yeah I think that sounds like a really useful feature to me it's a bit like the starlink data anyway uh where you have a priority and after the priority is used up it's then best effort but rather than this being best effort you're actually choosing the speed that you want that end user to have once they've consumed the amount that they're allowed in a day or a week or a month or whatever the time limit is so yeah that's a is that a new feature on in control then I think it's already existing but it is fairly new it is it exists already a few versions so the next one stalling mini powered from Poe of the mbx and one why I mean this this certainly isn't a tip but it's certainly a trick and you know I like doing crazy things you know I like to set myself a challenge and just do it because so I had an mbx sitting there I had the new starlink mini and the new starlink mini can work off 12 volts so I thought that would be great can I take the poe out of the mbx convert it to 12 volts using a little injector and run the mini so quite simple plugged one in plugged it into the mini did it work no it didn't and that's because each Port doesn't have enough amps because of the uh Poe technology that it uses so I thought that's fine that's fine why don't I get two so let's take it up to um 12 volts times 2 I'll get two of these adapters one on each Port I'll make sure that we um VLAN these ports off so it's not going to give any kind of internet connection it's literally just working as a Poe to 12vt injector plug that in and it didn't work and that was because the voltage drop was a little bit too much cuz it had gone from 12 volts and by the time it got to the end of the cable it was now less than 12 volts and it wasn't enough to power the star link so I thought well I can't add a third one at 12 volts cuz that's not going to work but the star link will work higher than 12 volts so let's get four of these let's use four ports uh so I used the first two ports bonded those together to make it a 24 volt at the end and then did the same same with the next two ports and made that also 24 volts and then join those together and put it into the starlink and it worked it booted up and I was able to do everything that you needed to do I lost four ports on the mbx but the mbx could power the starlink mini cleanly is and provide that connection on there that's pretty cool Joey all right and have you also tested the data rates as in the speed of the starlink mini yeah the starlink mini speeds are pretty good yeah yeah I know I've seen it it's unbelievable we are regularly getting um 15 megabits a second up or more which In fairness is sometimes as good as the high performance dish and we're regularly getting the download isn't as quick as the high performance or the Enterprise dishes but we're still getting a good 100 megabits per second speeds yeah it is advertised s magsi on the download it's perfectly usable coming back to the Poe I believe that peplink are working on their own Poe injector for styling I don't have many details about it at the moment but I do know that it's in development yes I think uh they're always looking forward to ways to to to make it much more a cleaner install or easier install and I think yeah this will help us out and this is perfectly to start of the Ping News section uh with the poe injector for a stalling mini or is it is it all Stallings or is it just it's be all Stallings it's well ah now I can't I don't know it's going to be all starlings but I'm under the impression it is going to be for all starlings but In fairness Starling standard for Poe is the same yeah it's just some take more watts more amps than the other but I'm pretty certain that they're designing it in such a way that it's going to be able to support the top level requirement at at the moment I've even heard it might be able to support two at the same time cool there's some really agent Adam stuff going on there some real investigations it's a result of the the Ping integration with Starling right or the the technical solution provider integration I must say that is that something that I think this is a a product of right yeah I think it's definitely related already they've got the management of starlink which allows you to do certain things but this just takes it to the next level yes yeah i' I'd like to see features on there of being able to see how much what's your drawing being able to do a power cycle on the device those those are pretty cool things yes yeah so if you're listening to this pep link you know we'll we'll we'll come up with loads of other suggestions I'll email you later really good really good all right so so so um is there any other news oh should we should we stick on the top secret stuff yes yes you're agent Adam so I have heard that peplink are working on the next generation of X devices so we're talking about the epx level of devices the 2500 Edge compute devices o ooh and they're looking at the speed at which it can work going forward CU at the moment I think the top level speeds that having any port on a pep Link at the moment the maximum would be 10 gbits per second right that be using an SFP port and I've heard there might be a qsfp port on this which can work up to 40 gigabits per second do you know what Q SFP is Joey no I I I've never heard of it so we obviously know what SFP is we know what SFP pluses these are the little modules that allow you to use things like fiber or you can even convert it to an ethernet port but a qsfp works at 40 gbits per second so it's like the Next Generation that there are even quicker ones but you know the fact that we're even looking at this is good and the way I've seen it used before is you could have a 40 gigabit module plugged in there with four tails on it each of 10 gig and those could then go into four switches so you're not losing any speed from your router into those switches o that's nice that's really interesting really cool so what watch this space I don't know I say it's a rumor at the moment I've heard they're working on these devices I hope it's true sounds really exciting to me and while we're talking about switches wait wait wait wait wait so so maybe it's good to reference as well what kind of EX devices there are currently are because if it's going to be the Next Gen X devices is it going to be the next mbx is it going to be the next epx sdx or sdx Pro or is it going to be a 3 adx or 58x or 310x um I think all of those things are are valuable for for an upgrade right with this what makes an x and x well it's it's the Extreme Performance uh series of pink right yeah I always wondered whether it was the Extreme Performance or the fact that it's expandable or whether it's both but then some X devices aren't expandable and some have Flex modules that are expandable so you've got the sdx which does have Flex modules and the epx yeah but then the mbx and the 310s and all of that so does it mean Extreme Performance I think it's both because even though the mbx doesn't have the flex modules like the epx as there is an option to purchase a module to be upgrading from a 4G mbx to a 5G mbx so you can take off the whole modem on the mbx and then up upgrade that with a additional module that you can buy and then you can make it a 5G well was before a 4G so yes expandable is also a really really good option a valuable point maybe maybe some investigation is needed here for the next episode we we we need to find out what makes a Gen X device a Gen X device yes and hopefully we'll have more news on these future X devices yes be interesting and talking about future devices Joey yeah switching switching I think it's been a long time since we've had a switching refresh in the peplink range but yeah I think it's worth the wait yes for sure for sure so there's a new range of peplink switches coming out uh do do we know when they're coming out depends on how much uh how much there is available during launch of course that's they all ping always wants to have something available during the lunch I know they are available for pre-order already but should we go quickly into the new range and what they've got so there's a new 24 Port rugged switch coming out there's a new 24 Port standard switch coming out and there's a new 48 Port standard switch coming out yes correct three new network switches yeah imminently and all of these switches have Prime Care on them as well yes Prime care costs less than the original versions of those switches yes correct and they really develop these new switches so they integrate really well into in control I'm feeling this episode is a real in control episode but it's fine it deserves being put on that pedestal yes but it allow you to actually access a lot more of that on in control and they've removed some of the features from the web-based version or you know the web based admin of the switches which I don't think is a bad thing I whenever I've managed the switches I've always used in control I don't think I've really gone into the web based version and done anything on there significant yeah and also when we did the 100 one when um build Showdown um you also use the in control to manage all of those felands on the switches so yeah yes because it just so easy so easy yeah um I also hear a rumor there's an eight Port desktop switch coming out we need to confirm that I've heard it may have Poe on it don't expect that till at least next year yeah for sure yeah so the 24port ruged is the only one that out of the all of the three versions 24 Ruger the 24 I think it was previously known as the Enterprise 24 PS Enterprise but is it still retaining that Enterprise or is it the enter price removed I canot I don't know for sure so so if we looking at the old devices it's um 24 points rug 24 ports Enterprise and then the 48 ports right MH there's there's two versions of the 24 ports so the 24 ports ruged uh just like the predecessor has it or doesn't have is a active cooling system it is passively cooled so it's very quiet the 24 ports that are coming the the Enterprise and now the new version of that really has an active same as the 48 ports so that's the difference and that's why it's called ruged as well so looking at some of the features of these switches Joey the 24 port for example will have 16 1 GB ports and will have eight 2.5 GB ports we're talking the actual ethernet port in addition to that they'll also have 4 time 10 gbit SFP ports which is no different than the previous version but looking at this the switch capacity is 152 gbits per second yeah that's a lot of it that's crazy absolutely crazy jump up to the 48 Port switch 224 gbits per second that's that's a lot that's really powerful isn't it I mean that is that is a lot of Netflix a lot of users using Netflix yeah yeah can internet even keep up with it well if you have the 101 w maybe yes but no that's really exciting so I think that is going to be out before the end of the year I they're certainly available for pre-order now because I've got one reserved look forward to playing with it soon amazing last thing I've got on here Joey on our pet link news is an antenna box what's this all about yes well um do you remember on our Tech day where we did the 101 wi uh where we showcase it there was also a special guest and that was not a person but it was a mockup sample of the antenna box from peping it was the the antenna Marx it's called and it is basically a 42g antenna with a box underneath and in that box you can house a B1 mini 5G B1 Pro 5G or a Transit Duo so that really eliminates the effect of using antenna cables actual cables and stuff and you the BM1 mini 5G you can power that F Poe but this one that we talking about today is the antenna box based on the 82g so this is the the the mobility antenna 82g has eight cellular elements two Wi-Fi elements and a GPS So the antenna box based on the 82g and I think it's going to be the antenna box Max Pro if I'm not correct if I'm not mistaken and this one you can house a br2 pro 5G so this is your dual sell of 5G anten box option amazing yeah really good all right that's that's it for the news right that is it for the news um good I feel I feel like there should be a little jingle or something now pink news all right now for the headliner of today's episode [Laughter] Joey you've been waiting for this I've been waiting for this W for this I mean it's a bit of a tease actually because I even put the the joke on here to begin with what the joke was going to be but there's no punchline so this podcast like every podcast I'm going to come up with an amazing dad joke hopefully peplink themed if you got your own please put those in the comments as well might use one of yours but here's the one for you this week you ready yes why did the br2 and the B1 get married Synergy mode it was because they just had such an amazing connection oh my God uh you scoring it this time yes so I I do need to score this one right Adam so um yeah I think I think this on the scale of how bad the joke is this is about nine out of 10 right but on the that joke list I think this is a solid seven to be honest um I I think I think that how good of a dead joke that was that a sa I want to keep it a little bit also like you need to work for it a bit more uh the next time so uh it's solid seven that's two solid jokes yeah and if you missed the last joke feel free to watch the last episode because that one was maybe it was better than this maybe it wasn't but still really good so another thing we want to talk about today Joey is the feature request section on the four of them yes what's this for so so we want to highlight or we want to talk about features that we like but we also want to highlight the feature requests that we find like interesting or that we that we personally like so um yeah we can give some special attention for a feature request and uh I think Adam you had one can we do one mine yes we do let's do one of mine so this is one I put on the Forum back in July and it's about managing the LED light on an access point from in control cuz quite often you know we do events and we'll put an access point in an event and it could be a dark room they don't want to have the big blue light showing on the device which is fair enough and at the moment we have to go into each access point individual ually and just turn it off and I feel it' be really good if we could just go into in control do it on a tag say and say anything with this tag turn the LED light off simple right yeah so like you have a a tag with the dark side yes there you go tag with the dark side look my jokes are still good Joey but good effort good effort but there's lots and lots I I see stuff on the Forum all the time for feature requests so there's one on there which you think perhaps needs a little more attention get in touch we can have a look at it maybe we'll feature it on one of the future podcasts yes we happy to do that Adam uh it was it was a great talking to you do you have anything else that you want to disclose here for before we wrap it up disclose go that sounds a bit official doesn't it yes you you've obviously heard something that I know about I think it's probably worth mentioning that the peplink summit's going to be in Orlando next month and I'm going to be there teaching the PCA there's going to be Captain Nick there there's going to be Professor Pete there there's going to be representatives from peplink there it's going to be a really interesting event I think focused on what's going on in the peplink community and then of course it's not long before we'll probably have our own in Europe as well yes indeed so if you still free uh beginning of November then uh yeah so uh if you if you want to participate in that event and and talk to agent Adam feel free to sign up and I think Joey we should probably try and do a podcast from there as well I think that'd be really interesting I'll see if I can grab some people from peplink and we can speak about some more things that interest us yes looking forward to it be really good all right well again thank you for listening thank you for watching if you watch this on YouTube um I think it was lovely to talk to you again Adam and um yeah I think I will see you then next time in Orlando or maybe we do one quick one in between but um thanks thanks for hanging out with me definitely and I look forward to hanging out with you this weekend because we've got a space launch to watch yes integration flight five was the Starship with Space six I'm really looking forward to it yes really good okay thanks Joey till next time till next time bye-bye"}

Peters company.com and have it just work uh uh without having to worry about mail one and mail two or having multiple you know uh you host names for you know my VPN and remote access and things like that and um when peping started playing around with introducing bonding it changed everything the ability to aggregate those Wan connections between my sites meant that I no longer needed expensive MLS to to have a a an SLA a high quality guaranteed circuit between my sites and I I I loved so much that if if you're one of my my ogs if you bought a 380 from me I did the install for free it was like I was like man like I'll drive all over the country installing these 380s um and the idea was simple it was like man we could replace your MLS circuit with two bonded fiber lines for less than the cost of your MLS circuit and so my old sales pitch was with peplink speed Fusion I could offer somebody more better increased reliability for less money which never happened you like you always everything always had this well I can give you more but it's going to cost more and this was the first time we could say I can give you more and actually when you compare it to the alternative Solutions were less expensive and it was an awesome sales pitch to be able to to do that um not smoking mirrors it's real no exactly it wasn't it wasn't like the sales gu saying hey this is awesome it was like no this is really awesome and once I let a customer see it everything Chang they like they were they were skeptical you know it's that whole uh saying right you know no one gets fired for for buying Cisco well it was like yeah but this works and it worked well um and so anyways so what we're g to do is we're GNA talk about bonding and kind of go over some of the myths around bonding as well as some of what other people are doing and then talk about the peplink bonding Technologies and so this is sort we we' have lots of speed fusion videos and things like that this video is just bringing it up to date but also talking about some of the history and why why some of these things are important yeah let's dive in yeah yeah let's dive in so so the most most common uh VPN protocol that that's used out there right now um is IPC and and IPC bonding um and and the idea is each session gets load balanced across multiple WS that are all creating multiple IPC tunnels with each other um this is commonly seen in your modern sdwan solutions or they'll tell you they picked the best or they'll tell you they're they're bonding what they're really doing is creating two or more IPC tunnels then load balancing the sessions across to those or actually round rining the sessions across those connections and that that in theory if you had a one gig circuit and another one gig circuit and you're load balancing you're G to see two gigs of through but it it in theory Works um based on that session La uh bonding but the problem is you're still only using one internet connection per session at a time and and if that one internet connection fails the session then has to move over to the other IP SE tunnel or the other internet connections that are that are established and so and then and then they have limitations they only work well when you're when you're combining similar circuits so you know two Broadband 500 Meg circuits well that way if you're load balancing and you're getting you're getting what you would perceive as one circuit and then the other thing is you're only going to get the maximum throughput of any individual circuit minus the overhead so if you have two one gig circuits and you really want to do that that backup connection at the end of the night and and use up 1.8 or 1.9 uh gigabits of throughput you won't be able to do that these scenarios you'd have to have multiple sessions to be able to utilize that and so it does increase reliability of of your connection it does give you what people would call sdwan but it's not um it's not what we do and I'll leave it at that because I think what we do is awesome yeah and I think this is what you see you know there's a lot of players in the sdwan space right and there's some very big names in the industry that have been doing this for a while and I think this summarizes what most of them are doing at a basic level it's it it's useful it's helpful right but it's not what peplink does it does not achieve the level of efficiency and application protection that we're able to do but um it's better than traditional IP sec I'll say that I guess exactly um okay I think the big the big downfall like you know you mentioned the the throughput there's some caveats to it but think fundamentally what what's happening there is any single application is going to again live and die by the quality of that s a single Wan and so yep you know you're only going to get the speed of a single Wan and if that Wan is degraded but still functional so is your application in most cases and so again it's it's useful but it's it's just not what we do exactly and another common um bonding method is lacp bonding um lacp bonding is basically creating uh interfaces and then and then using lacp protocol link aggregation connection protocol to bond those together um and and once again uh this this would in theory increase uh throughput if you had two one gig circuits that were operating with similar latencies and similar connection capabilities you would be able to then aggregate those together yeah I think biggest drab back here is it requires identical circuits basically correct yeah the biggest down side is is it's it's going to require the similar circuits and it's very latency and packet loss sensitive um if you have too much packet loss or too much latency it can it can break the the bond um creating an unreliable um solution for variable circuits like starlink or 5G or even some uh Broadband I mean if you've got a bad Broadband circuit it can it can really cause that to flip flap um uh creating a a instability in that circuit um and and I think most companies have really gone towards the IPC bonding um and and kind of moved away from lacp or or uh protocol bonding but um it's it does there are limitations on it yeah you see this still commonly like with Metro ethernet providers where they're going to give you two physical circuits and then they're going to use basically switches on each side to bond those two identical circuits a good use case for it but it it's very limited in terms of what connections you can bring to it it's kind of more of a a backend technology than something that yeah it's a car carrier handoff and the other thing too is it's not scalable you have to be on their platform to make it work like you can't just take a 5G chipset and throw it in there or starlink and throw it in there and add it to the to the mix yep exactly so speed Fusion bonding pepling said okay well lacp doesn't work I PC bonding isn't scalable how do we make a bonding solution that will work on any internet connection from any provider without the need for specialized carrier connectivity um and creates Dynamic capabilities to handle variable loads So 4G 5G cable modems DSL modems ethernet Metro ethernet private networks starlink you know how do I take how how can I create a bond a protocol a bonding protocol that allows me to use any internet connection and pepling invented bandwidth bonding and my life changed forever and I mean that in the utmost uh sense of of that I mean West networks and our company the ability to solve problems dynamically changed when when peplink introduced speed Fusion bonding and it's only gotten better every single year I just remember I can't I can't remember even what the year was but I remember the customer that really pushed this and it I can't say names because they're a government entity but they wanted to bond two vsac connections they had you know vsac connections have a pretty finite bandwidth at their Terminals and they had two of them and they had one application that needed more bandwidth than any one could provide so these other technologies that we've talked about just weren't useful for them and that really was what pushed our Engineers to really try and Tackle this challenge in the first place was just how do we make these two satellites come together and give you more bandwidth than any one of them could and we were able to achieve it our our Engineers tackled the problem and dug in and yeah then so was born speed Fusion we didn't call it that yet but um yeah it came out of an absolute need from a pretty important customer and and then I took that uh with a 380 and actually used cell modems and then bonded cell modems for the first 2D mamography image transmissions in Ru Louisiana um and so yeah it was I mean that was my first real speed Fusion project um initiated by Jerry mcclardy over at LSU and it was uh like gamechanging for the ability to to actually increase bandwidth and transmit those images in real time uh which was just not able to be done uh previously yeah it's like so many things that peplink has done over the years once you know the engineers create new solutions for problems that get brought to them and then the cat's out of the bag at that point our our user base our partner base like you Peter are so creative and have so many other challenges and you start applying them in ways that maybe we didn't even foresee at first and you know out comes this mobile mography solution from something that we really didn't frankly intend it to be used that way but lo and behold we keep working on it and improving it and yeah it solves that problem too and just kind of classic peplink story over and over again it is and one of our early case studies around B bandwidth bonding is actually Town Town Wanda in New York and th this was a neat case study because we actually adapt converted an entire town from a private NLS network over to a commodity internet bonded solution Layer Two so we were doing Layer Two across the network and basically they had their vlans for their police and their fire and their Water Works and different things like that with commodity internet and so they they did an evaluation of the cost of having a 100 megabits per second Ms Network between all their sites and the cost of just buying two 50m Broadband circuits across all their sites and we were able to save them around $86,000 a year in internet cost which this was years and years ago which was a big deal for them but that was less than the entire Capital cost to buy all the pep gear so for less than the cost to buy all the gear they were saving they had I mean it was literally a one year or less than one year Roi and they were able to increase that reliability and and um the the IT guy at the time this guy Andrew really challenged peplink and the technology to make sure the layer 2 worked and the vlans were able to span across those networks and he tested High availability and and so we were able to really fine-tune bonding at that during during a critical moment and kind of the evolution of the internet broadband and highspeed circuits were coming out and um and making this something that that everybody could use and it was an awesome to be part of but also to see what the peplink engineers were able to pull off I mean this the problems they could solve uh with just some some software we didn't have to buy new hardware we just tweaked the code and they were able to make it work and I think the underlying all of this is really the difference here is we're doing bonding differently and we're sending instead of sessions down different lengths we're sending taking the individual packets and redistributing those hence the next T and so it it's just it sounds simple right sounds like okay anybody could do that and it turns out that's complicated but again this is the the challenge that pep Link's up for and the trail that we blazed early on and that's why today we have such a different technology that is able to do so many more things we we have I think um Alex was saying at the at the Australian Summit but I think you know we're at what 18 years of bonding experience um like fine-tuning and and applications and and you think like any anybody like even if like you know Tesla or somebody like that that's going around getting all this information this you know people driving and they're learning how to drive by watching people drive peplink has 18 plus years of experience solving problems around weird Wan situations um and so it just makes us kind of experienced in that in that capability and what Travis just said we do this by doing packet based so we're not doing session based we're not doing round robin we're not doing lacp we're doing a customized VPN protocol with packet based bonding this means that we're monitoring those packets as they go across we're splitting that up and and actually using all available circuits with their latencies and Jitters and packet loss and individual nuances to each of those circuits and taking the best of all the inter available and and that's I I I I love being able to say that like oh you picked the best one no no no we take the best out of all of them so if AT&T can give me 10 and T-Mobile can give me 25 and Verizon can give me 15 I've got my 50 megabits of throughput and sorry do my math real quick but the idea is that I'm using every bit of Internet that those carriers can provide me and then there co uh uh don't know the right word here costs associated to it like you know if if if T-Mobile's latency is way better than AT&T's well the latency is gonna go up a little bit to match AT&T's right we because we're gonna make sure those packets get delivered at the same time and so you know you're not going to have the lowest latency unless you use some of our other technology but you know the idea is you're trading off and so you're going you're either going to trade off latency or packet loss in exchange for bandwidth or you're going to trade off bandwidth um and uh yeah bandwidth in exchange for packet loss lower packet loss and latency and we'll talk about that in a minute um but one of the one of the cool things is uh one of my one of my good friends uh Adam uh over in the UK agent Adam uh bonded 101 internet connections together on uh on an epx router to create an incredible opportunity for reliability and if you haven't followed him um he's now has his own name I'm Professor P he's agent Adam um and so he's the the European uh version of me and so uh he's and he's gonna be teaching at our peping Tech Summit and telling this story um but he was a he had a a mission critical event and I don't want to you know his story is pretty cool but um he had a mission critical event and he needed to to get as much internet as he could and he used Synergy mode and virtual Wan and Wi-Fi Wan and basically created 101 internet connections and bonded them all together to accomplish the mission and what an amazing Testament for the power of the hardware but also the scalability and I think that's really when you're looking at session based or lacp or or IPC tunnels um you have IP limitations cgnet limitations protocol limitations pink doesn't have those limitations we built our own protocols from the ground up making this incredibly resilient across all internet connections and so basically what whatever you can give me as an internet source I'm going to use that uh to to add to to increase reliability or throughput yeah and I love this because it sounds like this is like um some sort of like novelty thing right like why would you do this but I love it because Peter you've faced some of the biggest names in networking in Real World customer scenarios and you've been introduced to those customers because those vendors had very significant limitations and how far they could scale this concept and you've brought peplink in each time and demonstrated that hey peplink works here we don't have that limitation we can go way beyond that and so um 101 may sound like a crazy number but you know maybe your number is 13 maybe your number is seven whatever it is we can hit that number and we can hit those challenges and over and over again speed Fusion has been demonstrated to be superior at bonding efficiency bonding speed and reliability amen so what is speed Fusion speed Fusion is is and and I am going to read this because I think this one's important but speed Fusion is Ping's patented system architecture that delivers unbreakable internet connections enhanced speeds and seamless jitter-free video conferencing um and so speed Fusion achieves this by combining in to-end architecture with core Technologies integrated into every pepeling product uh so it includes soft allows users to configure Define prioritize the quality of service to their applications along with cloud services that are available on demand or through subscription and I and I don't normally read slides I try not to but I actually love this slide because we are like speed Fusion is not an IPC VPN or just lacp which we're constantly referred to and sometimes I have to do yeah yeah you know yeah you know we create these tunnels um but we're not we're we're from the ground up patented architecture that is different um and and allows us to scale unbelievably uh more efficiently than than other Solutions are are out there um and and what's cool is peplink when they see a need they try to solve that and so peplink is in to in so I've got an hd4 mbx in my car and then I've got an sdx in my office and I'm bonding to that sdx but they realize that not everybody has you know 40 gigs of internet at their office to to be able to to add to be a bonding host and so they offer peplink uh speed Fusion cloud and and so you can use our connect Service uh for your own personal environments or your op you know the ability to to achieve reliable internet from anywhere in the world yeah I think the the flexibility is something that really uh brings us into a lot of different projects because different sdw vendors have different architectures and they're basically isolated to that architecture some of them are very carrier aligned where they've partnered with carriers to put the debonding or the the other side of the bonding Appliance in the carriers Network and for certain scenarios that's great but peplink has this flexibility to do basically any of those architectures and still give you th those great outcomes and so it's again we just we're able to say yes to just about any project any requirement because of that flexibility and so yeah speed Fusion I I I really like that definition too yeah I just thought it fit really nicely so we know that b bandwidth bonding is not a one a one- siiz fits-all solution and some customers and I mentioned this earlier they go yes but latency is critical to me you know if I'm doing voice and video applications like this Zoom meeting I need to make sure that my latency is low that my Jitter is low or or non-existent that I don't have a lot of packet loss and so peping came up with something called Wan smoothing smoothing creates a raid array of your Wan circuits and and so so if you've ever played around with raid arrays for your hard drives especially you know back in the day um basically it's a redundant uh capability so instead of increasing bandwidth it increases or decreases latency and Jitter by duplicating packets so because we're packet based bonding not session based we can split up the packets and fill in gaps we're missing so if I've got you know my I've got this router's got two AT&T and two T-Mobil and I'm bonding those together so if either of those circuits starts to mess up the goal is that the bonding is going to fill in those gaps so the W smoothing is gonna add parity to be able to fill in if there's packet loss and Jitter um or latency spikes of the Tower and so it's going to create a nice clean environment no matter where I go and so you're sacrificing bandwidth in exchange for latency and reduced Jitter or low latency and reduced Jitter yeah like the raid example right it's a mirrored array right we're sending identical copies down each path so that if one of those discs fails there's no fail over time there the other copy's on its way simultaneously and that's just the difference of latency between the two circuits so we we use the fastest packet every single time so if you're driving and T-Mobile and AT&T are fluctuating we don't know who's going to be the fastest for each package so you you we just pick the first one every time and that results in smoother video better audio and ultimately lower packet loss and latency then we have Ford error correction Ford error correction we built for the broadcasters and this this is um kind of a middle ground between W smoothing and bonding the idea with for a correction is for broadcasters that need bandwidth you know a lot of times if you're doing like a 720p you need like you know uh two to two to three megabits of throughput if you're doing 1080 you need four to eight megabits of throughput and and so the idea is you need to make sure you have that minimum upload or a minimum of of you know four to 10 megabits of upload throughput for your stream so you don't want to like have this reduction of bandwidth in exchange for latency and you don't even care if there is a little bit of latency because you're broadcasting and there's buffering and things like that or go on what you need is to make sure those packets are delivered um and you want to make sure they're delivered well and so Ford error correction uses less overhead than W smoothing reduces Jitter by basically adding a smaller amount of parody so instead of a a full duplication of the packet it just adds parody bits um to each of the streams uh over each of the Ws and so if there's packet loss it can fill in the missing pieces that are received on the other W and so it's not a true mirror it it's just a parody bit that fills in those missing pieces that get dropped over cellular and Leo type Solutions where you have that packet loss occurring so it's gonna cost a little bit of bandwidth in exchange for Less Jitter or packet loss but not necessarily a reduction of latency if that makes sense yep so like like you said you know for my realtime applications like a viip call like a a zoom meeting a teams call Wham smoothing is going to achieve the the goal there but for a buffered video or nonre time content like you said you can sacrifice latency a little bit as long as your Jitter is good and and your bandwidth is good and so two different tools for two different applications ultimately exactly so w smoothing versus Ford air correction kind of like see a little pretty picture here and peplink has this uh nice guide here W smoothing does have levels um so you have normal medium and High um normal is going to be uh will be at most 2x of the original data traffic medium is going to be 3x the original data traffic high is going to be 4X the original data traffic and then maximum is going to be based on the number of w so it's going to create literally one a duplicate packet per Wan so you know in Adam um's video where he had 101 WS if he had maximum he'd have 101 duplicated packets um which that would be excessive in my opinion but um definitely funny to watch um where Ford error correction is gonna use 133% or 26 so it's low and high um so it's going to use 133% of additional overhead or 26% of additional overhead adding those parody bits to the redundance to the streams um so giving you uh like I said pit uh packet loss reduction Jitter reduction but not necessarily latency reduction so like in my case right now I've got three WS I've got a T-Mobile and and a Verizon and a second Verizon connection but I've got my my w smoothing for this call set to 2x so right now it's just using One Verizon and one T-Mobile if one of those two goes down I've got the third there that'll stream in and start sharing some of that payload but I'm not consum I'm not using overhead across all of those WS so I've still got more bandwidth on top of that too right I've got the benefits of way smoothing but I've also got this extra capacity on that third link because ultimately I don't need that much duplication in my environment I'm not moving I'm not in an unpredictable scenario things are pretty straightforward here and but again depending on who you are and where you are and what you're doing you may need that extra overhead to to really make sure things work as smooth as possible and so so then peplink said hey well actually I can't say peplink said hey customers said hey I like Ford a correction for broadcast but we need maximum bandwidth possible because they're we're uploading large large video streams and things like that and so they said Ford a correction is great but we don't always have packet loss is there a way to have adaptive packet loss prevention so add a little extra overhead when there's detected packet loss but if there's if if if I'm getting zero packet loss don't don't charge me 13 or 26% overhead so an 8.5 from where peplink introduced adaptive forward error correction and so basically it'll use somewhere between 6.7 and 20% of extra overhead depending on the amount of packet loss that's occurring this is a great way to maximize bandwidth while reducing the overhead of Ford air correction if you don't need it but with when you do need it it's there to to kick into to action and mitigate that packet loss and this just shows Ping's continued dedication to making the mission always accomplished uh they're they're constantly evolving based on customer scenarios and requests to make sure that you know we're going to get the best best possible uh solution or bonded environment based on the internet we can we have and and then that you know I add in there pink is not an ISP they're a techn techology a software and Hardware solution and so all we can do is take the isps and the carriers and make sure we we can use them the most efficiently as possible um and so you know we're just trying to adapt Based on data plans based on packet loss latency signal strength uh Jitter and overhead internet availability failures and uptime um and so what we're trying to do is and uh Travis said it the best during the first summit you like all we're trying to do is get as many nines as possible we're not going to get 100% we're gonna get 9 99.999999 and it's like the more internet connections we have with high availability routers just it's more nines and so we're just increasing that likelihood that we're going to have a good result um by you know combining those internet connections together and then creating solutions that adapt to the environment that this these pep links are being deployed in one really cool thing about this forward adaptive Forward Air correction too is it's super intelligent at the at the link level and so you know previously you had to set this you know fixed level of overhead and that applied to all of your links well usually you only have one Link at a time that's really causing problems or having problems right and you know you've usually got one or two good links and maybe one or two bad links and our Dynamic fa we look at this at every single p level so if you've got a mobile router with four links and you're talking to a data center that has two links there might only be a problem on a path from this one link over here to this one Link at the data center so we're only going to increase the overhead on that single path because the other paths are fine we don't need to use that overhead there and so it's just highly efficient and very very granular in how we evaluate each of those paths and and where we need to protect them more so again you're just getting the absolute most out of those links without you know sending a whole bunch of extra gigs through and you don't really need to sometimes exactly um and then so we take these Technologies bonding smoothing uh FEC or adaptive FEC and then you say well I have scenarios where I might need to use all of those I want to be able to transmit files as fast as possible I want to be able to do Microsoft teams or Zoom meetings with W smoothing and then want to be able to stream or broadcast well peplink supports sub tunnels sub tunnels allows you to create five that's a test question five sub Tunnels for every speed Fusion uh connection that means that you could have a sub tunnel that has hot failover from fiber to broadband or Fiber to Bonded starlink or Fiber to Bonded 5G so you can have one fiber line that's your gig by gig circuit and then you can hot failover to Bonded 5G or starlink um you can have a tunnel that uses w smoothing you can have a sub tunnel that uses FEC or adaptive FEC and then you can create outbound policies that says if the destination is Microsoft teams or Zoom use Wan smoothing if the destination is my YouTube rtmp server use adaptive FEC if the destination is my remote site or or just the internet YouTube and Netflix and Office 365 use bandwidth bonding because I don't care if there's a little bit of latency or packet loss on an https stream because it's gonna it's going to mitigate that those TCP streams are going to handle that just fine they're designed to handle that that those limitations so I want as much bandwidth as possible going out to the internet but I want to make sure that my my my teams meetings and my zoom meetings are smooth and perfect and resilient um and so you can actually create sub tunnels and then use outbound policies to drive traffic to each of those tunnels yeah and that's really important because different applications have different needs right like we can have gigabit cable internet at our house but our zoom and teams meetings still have poor quality right zoom and teams doesn't need more speed they need more consistency and so we're able to map those applications to the appropriate sub tunnel policy so that you get what you need for each each application on your network exactly and um uh peplink uh you know this is a lot of information and we get asked a lot of questions about speed Fusion so peplink put together a speed Fusion white paper working with partners and and enthusiasts around the world um that collaboration is the speed Fusion white paper and it's going to be available at pink.com brochure download um it when that comes online uh you'll be able to access that um so if you want if you're a peplink partner and you're trying to to demonstrate the value of speed Fusion to your customers um this is going to be a great resource for you to be able to hand out and show um all the stuff that that goes into speed fusion and W smoothing uh Ford eror correction adaptive Ford eror correction sub tunnels things like that um we're going to have that in this speed Fusion white paper yeah this is kind of like our resume right like we've talked about all these different things that makes pink speed Fusion bonding better than anybody else out there and this white paper is really going to put some put some words to that and help you communicate what all the differences are in speed Fusion because again there's lots of people that say they do bonding but bonding isn't bonding you know everybody does it differently and it the results vary tremendously and that's again why we're able to win in so many scenarios where somebody else's bonding wasn't up to task and so that white paper is really going to get into the nitty-gritty of what the differences are and talk in in detail about a lot of the things that we've talked about here but um again in a digestible format that you can provide to your customers Partners customers exactly and if you're a peplink uh partner or enduser and you want to learn more about uh peplink uh Technologies and integrating them um please join us at the peplink tech Summit this this year it's going to be in November uh in the Hilton Orlando convention center and so uh we're GNA have sales training for if you're a sales for your sales team um peplink certified associate training for your tier one and tier two techs and then peplink certified engineer training brand new I mean actually writing that content right now peping certified engineer training Travis and I are going to be hosting the pce um agent Adam and Captain Nick from Europe and New Zealand are gonna be hosting the uh PCA and John grot and my own Tim sesy are gonna be running the pcss the peping sales um so uh throwing that out there join us at the peping tech Summit uh this year and we actually have some time for Q&A and there's a lot of questions and I wanted to skip those last slides because there are a lot of really good s questions and so I'm going to go through some of them if I don't get to your question please feel free to email uh you know uh Peter West networks.com or Travis pink.com and and we can answer those questions for you um but I am going to go through some of these um for uhh for you um so one person asked what if I have a circuit that's 200 megabits per second with another circuit is 100 megabits per second what's the theoretical bonding speed Fusion or speed throughput so that's going to be 300 megabits per second minus 18% overhead of speed Fusion so just round that to 20 uh that's it's going to be uh 60 megabits so you'll be at you know two uh 240 megabits of of total throughput um so like 245 is p uh megabits per second um so so you're gonna have an 18% overhead for Speed fusion and then if you use Wan smoothing that's a that's either 100 200 300 right so you're GNA have overhead on top of that um so if you're doing forward error correction it's 18 and then forward error correction is going to overhead 13 or 26% and those are really good things to know when you're running your calculations um also peplink has a tool built into our Hardware called Wan an analyzer the WAN analyzer you can actually run nonbonded tests between all of your circuits and your head-end unit to make sure that hey I'm getting 250 megabits of throughput minus my bonding overhead or minus my Ford eror correction overhead minus my w smoothing overhead this is my expected capacity yeah that landal tool is really important because a lot of the times we see people say like hey look I'm getting this much speed on speed test.net well speed test.net is not where you're sending your application to right you're sending your application to a server on some other side and so the when analyzer evaluates that exact path and what the just native throughput is outside of any tunnel or bonding and then then you can compare that more accurately to what a bonded performance looks like so um I have a webinar about peplink and starlink um with speed fusion um David asked a question about starlink and and peplink and cellular one thing to be aware of with starlink and bonding is there are some some higher than normal packet loss when you're talking about real time protocols over starlink um most likely due to the Leo nature um we are working to uh to constantly working to improve that um but but with packet loss it's important to enable either W smoothing or Ford air correction when you're using starlink um so you'll actually see better bonded throughput on a Ford air correction link and thank you Martin langid from from Europe uh for for discovering this a couple months ago but you'll find better capacity with Ford eror correction enabled um than even if you just do bonding by itself so starlink if you're using starlink try Ford eror correction to mitigate packet loss which actually seems to help um in some scenarios increase throughput as well yeah you're going to very typically see about 1% packet loss on a good Starling connection and that's like Peter said that's just the nature of starlink and and Leo and so right there there's room for improvement that pep Link's able to help and and mitigate some of those experiences um for some Enterprise users that 1% isn't acceptable and so speed Fusion is there to help smooth that out and and provide a better experience we don't this U um someone asked if this is we're going to do detailed speed Fusion bonding we already have speed Fusion bonding uh detailed webinar um and so if you go back to Pink University speed Fusion we actually go over configuring speed fusion um this is really to talk about the Technologies and and you know kind of debunk some of the myths around it uh but but we have another peplink University speed Fusion webinar that goes over the actual settings yeah so uh Ricardo you you said to be clear if we have two 50 meg circuits 100 Meg of total throughput um you should see around 80 what 82 megabits right 18 yeah 82 megabits of of usable throughput um David and David asked if you can use W if you can use smoothing can you select which connections are allowed to participate in smoothing um and the answer is yes um in speed Fusion profile settings you can actually choose which WS are utilized and so when you choose the Ws like you could create a sub tunnel for smoothing then only select particular WS that you want to be involved in smoothing and that goes into I mean like literally it's a multi-hour conversation about configuring speed Fusion it's why we have the PCA and pce training because there's a lot that goes into speed Fusion more than we can do in a single one- hour webinar um but you can fine-tune a lot of settings inside speed Fusion like latency cut off which WS are being used for upload and download so symmetry you can also do which WS are used in a particular profile we talked about you can have five profiles well you can have a profile that's just two internet connections with hot failover you can have another profile that is just Cellular Connections you have another profile that's just starlink you have another profile that's all of them together um and so um you can choose the Ws choose how the WS are used choose latency cut off hey if you have a a latency specific application that needs it to be under 93 milliseconds of latency you can cut off the Ws that that exceed 93 milliseconds and that way you're not adding extra overhead where you don't need it to be because your mission requires 93 milliseconds and so you can actually um sorry you can actually set up internet connections based on or set up speed Fusion profiles based on your needs and so those are all going to be in your advanced settings I'm highly highly recommend going through the PCA training watching the speed Fusion video or set up a meeting we can answer those questions directly for FEC um overhead is either 13 or 26% adaptive FEC is six to 20% uh measure BWI um currently adaptive FC is only configured on local profiles if you're using the the beta version of in control it's it's available and then you should see that get pushed out to Earth and Mars here soon so adaptive FEC will become a drop down um where you have FEC low and high you'll then have adaptive um as an option it's currently available um let see if I have my so in in uh in control if I go to my speed Fusion Fleet and speed Fusion configuration edit there's my two servers there's all my tunnels and so right there for a correction adaptive so you'll have disabled low high and adaptive um this is in um kind of the beta version of in control for testing uh this should come to GA here um very soon probably in the next release TR see if there's any other there's a lot of questions and some of these are really good and just not able to answer the amount of time that we have um so once again if if if I'm not answering your question please feel free to email us um Travis pink.com Peter atwest networks.com and we can answer um somebody asked why I call Hot failover a bonding method uh because it is uh you need bonding in order to hot fail over the idea of hot failover is session persistence so in other words you have sessions going over fiber and then you want to move that to a cable modem or Broadband circuit um without dropping the session you need to encapsulate that in speed Fusion but if that fibers two milliseconds gigabit and then you have a Broadband circuit that is 500 by 35 with 13 milliseconds you're better off doing hot failover instead of bonding so you can do hot failover says priority use the fiber connection and then only if that fiber connection fails do I want you to move that data over to the Broadband circuit because if I've got a gig by gig 2 millisecond latency internet connection I don't want to slow that down to 13 millisecs for an extra 35 Megs of upload and then you know minus overhead you're actually G to lose that anyways um so hot failover is a bonding technology it's part of speed Fusion that allows you to maintain session persistence regardless of this um while while while ensuring that your primary circuit stays online as a priority um Bond bonding starlink is tricky um there's there's a lot of considerations as somebody Anonymous attendee uh said U you know when combining starlink WS um I try to tell people bonding is kind of weird with starlink 1 plus one uh does not equal two 1 plus one equals a really really really good uh one and then you need to have that that third and fourth one and fifth to actually see benefit of bonding starlink on a regular basis um there's congestion uh no node congestion there's there's packet loss and latency issues that go into bonding starlink where you need to create stability first by using FEC and two starlinks and then what you want to do is that third and fourth and fifth starlink those are going to start to see bandwidth improvements that you would see on a normal basis a lot of times with starlink what we recommend actually is load balancing your starlinks and then bonding with W smoothing or FEC for for voice and video applications to reduce that Jitter and latency but once you get to three four five and we've bonded 40 starlings together and we're seeing incredible throughput um we we've seen up upwards of of almost four gigabits of throughput bonding starlink it does work you just have to it needs to be placed properly you need to have a powerful enough router to accomplish it and then you need to make sure that you're understanding that that that Starling does have packet loss issues um and so we just need to make sure we we address that um the Summit is in person uh in Orlando um peplink techsummit decom um we we I think we're going to do a little live stream sneak a sneak live stream of bonding 10 starlings together is what one of the things that we're going to be doing as well as some T-Mobile bonding but the most of the summit will be uh in person only at this stage of it and and there are still a lot of questions so I I just want to say if I did not answer your question please feel free to email um Travis and myself um I Know Travis has been typing like crazy answering questions in the background as well he's smiling um but the um but yeah I mean the idea is that when smoothing or speed Fusion is not just IPC wrapped in a an lacp or or a traditional what's currently being used out there in the world W smoothing is built from the ground up it has 18 years of experience and we have multiple bonding algorithms to to solve uh different application challenges and so if you have a weird challenge have a weird application um and the traditional bonding Technologies aren't working for you um I highly advise taking a look at speed fusion and understanding how our application uniqueness allows us to solve more challenges than than others be able to uh might not or might not be able to solve I guess um but anyways thank you so much Travis once again thank you for for hosting like you do um and I'm I'm looking forward to meeting you in person down uh you know again down at the summit here in November which is just a month away um so the next Summit the next uh webinar will be uh at the this well it might be after the summit actually but um but yeah uh join us at the peping tech Summit and and meet everybody and and come hang out and learn and look at all the new toys and uh yeah and and plus you know Florida weather in November it's gonna be gorgeous so come join us I think yeah I think the summit anybody who's like questioning speed Fusion skeptical not sure if it's going to work for what they're doing go to the summit and talk to the people that are using it you will talk to so many end users from such bigname companies that you never even had a clue were using peplink that we can't say are using peplink but seeing is believing and talking over and over again people have tried to do these things with so many other vendors and they land on peplink because it works and it does something different and that Summit is going to be the best testimony to what the power of peplink really is so get your butts over there and go talk to the people that are using it already that's I'll end with that thank could have said it better so we we'll we we'll sign off thank you so much have a great day and enjoy uh and if you're in Florida um you know if you need help let us know um we're also in Florida I know that Hurricane's coming through so you we've got starlinks in stock we got pep links in stock so if you're in Florida and you're affected um over the next couple days uh please reach out and let us know if we can help you out"}

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "awesome thanks for joining everybody once again I'm Travis Durk and as always we have Professor P Peter West here and today we're gonna talk about Wi-Fi mesh I'm pretty excited about this uh Travis because I think people get Wi-Fi roaming confused with Wi-Fi mesh and I I really I I thought it'd be fun to like talk about meshing but also preface this with a little bit of education on the D roaming and meshing um because I I think people think oh I want to connect multiple Wi-Fi access points together therefore it's meshing but there's aition wired connectivity where you can roam between APS and meshing where we're wirelessly extending your network without wires um so um so I'm I'm pretty excited today we get to talk about some technologies that that go hand in hand and then we're going to do a little um guide I've got three uh Wi-Fi a xap sitting here in the car and so as long as my power doesn't shut off on me I'm going to demonstrate that to you guys um and so I think overall we're gonna have a really fun fun hour I think that's a really good point too yeah I I I hear that t that term mesh get used like you said for roaming and yeah that's a different thing but they they definitely have some interplay here that's a good one to dig into yeah and and so I'm actually going to start with with that a little bit we're going to talk about what is Wi-Fi meshing uh versus wi-fi roaming and um and peplink supports both and and that's a kind of a neat thing about this but um Wi-Fi meshing is the ability to extend the coverage range of your Wi-Fi network wirelessly um and and I know that's a lot of the word Wi-Fi in the description but it's important so basically we have your router or an AP and you don't have the ability to run an ethernet cable from the router to another Wi-Fi AP to extend the coverage area um and so the idea is with meshing I can put up an AP in my bedroom and have it wirelessly connect to the AP in my it closet and then extend the coverage range so that as I move around my home I can roam so I can connect from one AP to the other AP seamlessly and so roaming is the ability to connect between one AP and another AP seamlessly As you move around a building or an or a space and so uh often people think of oh I need to be able to mesh my network together but you can you can roam wired or Wireless um so if I have like right now I have three APS plugged in for my demo today they're all connected via Ethernet because I'm going to program them so I could set up roaming between these three APS that allows me to hop from AP to AP to AP as I move around my my building now obviously I'm in a car I'm not going to move around uh the building here but but if I were to have these in a building I could roam with those seamlessly using um Wi-Fi roaming uh built into the peplink routers then I could unplug the ethernet wires from these APS and mesh them together wirelessly and then still be able to roam as an additional feature of the aps um and so we're going to talk about meshing today which is the ability to extend the coverage area of your network wirelessly so no need no wires needed um and so the you know a lot of times you've got uh you can't run physical wires or you it's maybe it's too costly or you need a temporary location where you just want to extend the Wi-Fi capabilities of your network yeah like normally in an Enterprise Network you're going to have multiple Wi-Fi access points and they're all going to have an ethernet cable running to them back to Some central point so they're all broadcasting that same network and like you said you can roam between them but each one of those APS is hardwired in a normal scenario and so that's not meshing right like you said that's roaming with meshing you have a spot where it's hard to get that ethernet cable to that access point and so meshing lets you put that thing where you want it to add coverage there but you don't have to have that wire to it and there's some trade-offs and things that we'll disc discussed there too but it's a great tool to give you that flexibility to fill in coverage when it's just not possible to get a wire to that that one access point correct and and actually part of this discussion is gon to be some limitations to meshing that I think aren't commonly shared you know like oh mesh mesh mesh it's easy it's simple but there are limitations related to Performance and things like that and so I will caveat this where if available you should always run wires between your APS you're going to have much more stable wireless network where you can roam seamlessly throughout the infrastructure but that's not always the case and you and that's where meshing comes into play and and so we'll talk about that and how we can use in control to zero touch um configure Wi-Fi meshing and we and then I have a live demo we'll actually set that up and and actually unplug the ethernet wires and show it switch from a wired AP setup to a meshed AP setup yeah meshing is a super useful and Powerful technology but like you said it's it's not your first primary tool if if you're trying to add more Wi-Fi coverage you should plug it into an Ethernet back haul if you can but if not then meshing is meshing is the tool for you exactly and so in a traditional um home or small office Network you know you're going to try to put an access point or your router um centrally located in your building or space so that way you can provide this wireless network connection and you got to think like if you have a router and then you're going to have wireless coverage it's going to span around that router so you have your router and then you have the coverage area of that router and so if you a lot of times you might put your router next to a wall or a service uh uh area where where the cable internet or the fiber internet's coming into your space and and that actually has to be in the you know one of the walls of your space and so if you go to the other end of your space you might not have good coverage whereas if you could put your router in the center of your space it might actually provide enough coverage um and so the idea is that with um router placement being unpredictable sometimes you might not have perfect coverage throughout your fac your space and so meshing allows you to basically take another wireless access point um like a an AP1 ax that I have here with me in my lab car lab and um and and then place it somewhere else in your space to extend that coverage um and so it grabs greater flexibility um you don't have to worry about running physical wires and then they're going to talk to each other and extend that Wi-Fi network for Seam for seamless roaming As you move around your space I think another term that we hear a lot that's going to maybe confuse some people is just a repeater or an extender that there's some kind of common similar terms that are maybe almost the same thing but they're still slightly different than mesh too so U mesh is like a better version of a repeater if that makes sense um but we'll get into more details as well here yeah and actually you know I don't really have a slide on repeaters but and since we're talking about that and we're talking about comparisons you know back in the you know gez back in the I want to say the early 2000s late 90s you know you just get those little Netgear repeaters and basically you would program it to talk to your Wi-Fi network and then it would rebroadcast the network that was sort of a makeshift version of like WDS right but it's actually a Wi-Fi client and then access point and so it it doesn't it's not the same thing as a mesh a mesh is designed to basically streamline the WDS process making a a layer two connection uh throughout your network uh for that back call whereas a repeater is actually acting as a client connecting and then rebroadcasting and so it makes it a non seamless Network you're not going to be able to have Wi-Fi roaming you can't go from one to the other seamlessly it's going to have a small disconnect as you go from one repeater to another repeater um because they're actually clients with a broadcast yeah yeah mesh is just a more sophistic repeater and you can have more advanced layouts where maybe one mesh node connects to another mesh node which connects to a wired node where repeaters you're just not going to be able to automatically support those kinds of layouts and so yeah mesh is the the basically the Enterprise version of a repeater I would say setting up wireless network meshing is is very easy with peplink there's two ways to do it um one like most peplink products we we have um our UI which is like the balance UI and then we have our cloud in control and so you can set these up on the UI or you can set up meshing in in control with zero touch I'm going to live demonstrate zero touch and I will use these slides to demonstrate the UI if you log into your wireless APS you simply go into the meshing of WDS mesh tag T area the AP and then you can go into Wireless meshing which is right below WDS and then you can create a new mesh Network and is You' plug all your APS in log into them go to the AP Tab and then go to mesh configuration and then you'd be able to set up your meshing if you're running 8.4.2 or earlier um you're going to have 2.4 and 5 GHz if you're running 8.4.3 or4 you now have the ability to do um uh 2.4 and five and 5 GHz you're G have an additional radial option here called both and I'll show you that when I do mine um you basically have to do two things though and this is a common mistake you have to create the W wireless mesh then you have to assign the wireless mesh to a to a profile so we have uh AP settings profile settings and then you're going to have to assign the wireless mesh to the profile and and if you don't do that you're not going to be able to get the wireless mesh settings and so you want to make sure we do that if you're not using in control you create the wireless mesh then you assign the mesh to the profile under settings after you do that you're going to get this if you're running 8.4 firmware you're GNA get this really nice new mesh link information uh page um and I created this when I I have a YouTube video also where I talk about this but basically we're going to have this mesh information page that now shows up which is really nice um it gives you all of the signal strengths the the uh the type of connection that's happening it gives you the length type so you know which ones are ethernet which ones are Wi-Fi um and and it's going to give you a lot more information about your signals as well as it's going to give you that 2.4 and 5 gigz with the throughput and signal strength so you can really see a lot more of what's going on and once again I'm going to demonstr demonstrate this in real time with my lab um this is new with 8.4 uh sorry there's so many firmwares 3.8.4 um Wi-Fi firmware uh that that you're going to be at this new UI that gives you a lot more information about meshing so it's it's a great feature that they've added um it has sort of previously it was just a status and you really didn't know um everything out there was just that top bar right there that mesh status it basically said hey here's your mesh and you're connected now you get this mesh link information at uh top so then you can do it in in control and I'm going to show you that in real time so I'm going to exit this and I have my peplink University if you have not already seen this this is sort of my play lab so I'm actually using my speed Fusion backpack so this is my br2 Pro and I've got my my internet connections here then I have three APS hardwired to my backpack and then I have 12volt power supplies to them this way I can unplug them from ethernet and set them up right now I have no Wi-Fi provisioned on these these are just blank devices they have no Wi-fi program so I'm going to set up a Wi-Fi SSID and then program meshing for these devices now I could use my br2 as the as because it's a Wi-Fi 6 device I could use my br2 as the base as like kind of like the the Central Point uh mesh uh but because I'm on my Wi-Fi talking to you I'm going to have this completely isolated okay so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to program my SSID that I want to broadcast I'm going to go to my Wi-Fi group wide SSID settings I'm going to click add new SSID and I'm going to name name this mesh demo then I can say device selection and I'm going to apply this to some devices with the tag mesh so when I added these serial numbers the the the uh APS to in control I tagged them with the word mesh saying Hey I want to want to make sure these are part of this if you have a whole bunch of devices you could have mesh one mesh two mesh three Etc if you wanted to um and then I'm going to set my security policy so I can say WPA2 wpa3 I give it a little password I'll just do one two 3 four 567890 um for this demo and you see this right here fast trans position this is what we talk about roaming so if you have hardwired devices which these are and I turn on Fast transition that allows me to go from AP to AP very smoothly without dropping um connection so the aps are going to transition but there's one more thing that we're going to do to make that transm transition even smoother which I'm going to show you today um then we have all of our other SSID options um we have a you know a whole training uh training. pink.com where you can learn about these but for right now that's that we're just creating the SSID so I'm going to hit save changes now in order for wireless roaming to be effection uh efficient I I we need to give it a signal threshold and we to say hey at what signal do I want to allow these to roam effici efficiently and so the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my Wi-Fi AP group-wide radio settings and I'm going to filter by mesh which I could do right here and then I'm going to select all of my my APS and you can see I've got three APS but six items here so you can see there's my 2.4 and 5 gigahertz on each of those APS so first I'm setting my output power to low once again I'm in a car don't need them broadcasting the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to set my minimum client signal strength this is critical for seamless roaming this actually has nothing to do with meshing but more importantly with roaming so if I set my signal strength toga 71 which is recommended for um uh HD video quality and teams and things like that then that means that as I move from AP to AP as soon as I hit negative 71 dbm I'm gonna it's my laptop or my device is going to start looking for the next AP so instead of holding on and holding on until I have really bad signal strength then moving over and it'll still move over seamlessly but I'm going to move over once that signal is poor I could force it to move over to the new AP um while the signal is still good this means that my teams and my zoom calls you know if you're doing a a consistent ping all those things are going to affect uh move over very efficiently and um and without high latency as you step away from one AP and get closer to another AP so I like to set it up as negative 71 and then set up my placement of my APS so that that way I've got a constant negative 71 signal or better uh throughout my facility so I'm GNA go and apply changes to that so now my Wi-Fi is set up I've got my my Wi-Fi mesh a uh signal set up I've got fast transition my roaming set up and I've set my signal client strength so I know hey as I move from a AP to AP it's going to be very clean and and seamless now I can set up meshing so I'm going to scroll all the way down in this radio settings and you see this wireless mesh I can create multiple mesh IDs here so if I have a large organization with a bunch of different sites I can create different uh meshing topologies or I can just have one meshing topology and just literally plug APS in wherever I go and it's going to be seamless meshing across my entire facility or facilities so I'm going to create a Wi-Fi mesh ID so I'm going hit add I'm going to call this mesh I'm going to do frequency both so you can see what that looks like and you can see right here that this requires 8.4 firmware and 3.93 or above then I'm going to give it a pre-shared key I'm G do the same one 1 2 3 4 5 six 7even eight N9 zero I don't recommend that obviously if you're stting your own network but for PC this fine hit okay now remember I talked about with the manual setup we have to create the mesh then we have to assign the mesh to devices so right here device selection all devices device managed so I could say disabled or device managed then I can go in here and add see that plus right there hit plus and I can say devices with any of the following tags or with none of the following tags so I can with any of the following tags mesh and then I can assign it my mesh profile above this says my three devices that I've create I've assigned for meshing assign this mesh profile so I hit save changes and now I've set up my wireless SSID I've set up roaming I've set up the mesh ID and I've pushed it to those three devices so if I go back to my dashboard I can see there's my three devices they've been online for a little while here and you can see a few seconds ago they they received their configuration change you can see that right there so if I go into this device right here uh 6825 you can see right now I'm connected there's my IP address I'm ethernet wired I can go to settings remote web admin the AP tab hold on let me go back real fast there you can see my mesh demo Wi-Fi 2.4 and 5 GHz so it's set up right there um so that's the Wi-Fi that I I pushed out then I can go to the AP Tab and then if I go to Y AP wi wireless mesh right there there's my mesh profile automatically getting pushed right from in control you can see right there it says managed in in control so if I'm not using in control I could add the profile manually um but right there it says in control management enabled and you can see my mesh profile frequency both then if I go to mesh status it's GNA show there you can see there's my three APS and they're all linked via Ethernet you see that so I can see my three APS that I have um plugged into my vehicle here and they're all connected via Ethernet they're all at gigabit and so you can see that those are there so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to unplug the Ethernet from these devices so here's here's my device so I'm going to unplug the Ethernet from this one and I'm going to unplug the Ethernet from this one and I'm going to keep the ethernet on the Hub device my my device that's actually physically plugged into the router that's going to make sure that's like sort of my start my Hub and spoke right so I've got my main my main AP plugged into my router and now I'm wirelessly bridging these two um uh remote APS and so in a few minutes or a few seconds hopefully it doesn't take too long uh it's gonna those will then change to wireless and I can pull those up I can see those in in control so I can go back to in control and I can pull up these two devices you can see they went offline and in a few seconds they should come back online with their mesh settings so there you go no cable detected but see how it's online and in a few seconds it's going to say wireless mesh there there it is oh look at that connected via Wi-Fi mesh you see that and this one should say the same thing in a few seconds and if I go to this one you can see both of them are connected right there you see that 2.4 and 5 gahz 2.4 and 5 gigahertz and then there's my my kind of APS and my mesh connection there between them all you see that so they're all talking to each other in a mesh Network I can see my signal strength I can see my capabilities my throughput my my devices and this right here this this chart is new with the 3. um 9.4 firmware and I think I said 3.8.4 I apologize confused that with the 8.4 and 8.5 firmware it's 3.9.4 for um ADP firmware and you can see that now I've got my wireless mesh set up so almost effortless effortlessly I was able to create this wi-fi mesh using 2.4 and five gigahertz creating a completely scalable Network um without with zero touch configuration using in control the key here is I plugged in the aps first brought them online made sure they're running 3.9.4 firmware using in control then I provisioned the Wi-Fi SSID and then I provisioned the uh mesh profile and then I pushed the mesh profile to those three devices um what I did not show you which I'll show you real fast because I forgot is when I added these devices to in control you can click the edit tag here I selected the three devices these three APS went to tag and I I created a mesh tag and then I assigned that mesh tag to those three devices so when I added these devices to in control for the first time I assigned the mesh tag and that's how I manage that um I did that before the webinar I apologize I should have done that um when I started but then that's how I got the mesh tag right there and that's how we can then zero touch and provision those settings and you can see that that's all online um I think this here if you go back to that diagram on the status yeah so this is an I think it's it's hard to pick out here but this illustrates something really important about mesh and we've talked about repeaters and extenders before but mesh can go multiple directions at the same time and so what mesh is doing is it's evaluating the different paths so you can see we've got this triangle here so this 2850 is the master that's the that's the headend with the internet connection or is it 6825 yeah 6825 is the master and the yeah and these are the two remote ones and so what you can see if you if you look at one of these lines here there's different connection paths and it looks like we lost the one it looks like oh no no there it is okay so there's yeah there's two there's three there's two paths for each so you've got 6825 to 28 2 A5 Z on 2.4 you've got that same AP to AP on 5 gigahertz then you've got 6825 to 4 d75 on both frequencies but then you've got this other one this 2 A50 to 4 D7 five so there's a path between those two remote Wireless links too and so what that what's it what it's doing is it's evaluating each path so it has two different ways that it can get back to that internet connection it can go directly to it and in this case it's choosing that you can see the transmit rate on letter B there it's not transmitting anything back and forth there it's not choosing that path but it could but if this if this moved too far away and and this wasn't good it could actually relay through 4 d75 then get to 6825 exactly and so it's dynamically evaluating those different options and giving you different ways to get that traffic back and forth and it's actually changing that real time there too so that's an enhancement of mesh over something like a repeater a repeater is going to be a static thing like you said it's not going to roam completely seamlessly and it's not going to make those Transitions and dynamically update like that either so mesh is just a much more sophisticated way which is going to give you better results in the end when you have ch RF environments changed dynamically all day every day and so if a forklift moves in between this one and that one that path may change it may find a better path what you see in the real world with your eyeballs or on paper with a building layout is not what the RF paths look like right those change a lot and dynamically and so mesh just finds more ways to get that traffic back there efficiently and dynamically exactly and I do have two really good questions so I'm going to adapt them or address them real fast one one um somebody asked if we can U if meshing is um brand specific and and it this is definitely brand specific you um so you you're not going to be able to mesh a peplink AP with a with an Aruba AP they're it's you're going to mesh with um uh Pink to Ping correct another question I see does mity disable the use for ban to mesh or user access and the answer is no you can use one frequency for both you can you can choose either way right you can dedicate a frequency for mesh and not let users on it or you can use them for both purposes and I would say there's some Nuance to that too but um yeah so you're going to have uh if you do um if you if you broadcast and connect on the same frequency you are sharing that the power of that radio and so you are going to have some degradation of performance um so you do want to pay attention to the fact that the the more mesh hops you have the lower the performance don't expect gigabit now what's really nice if you see that we're negotiating at 2.1 gigabits per second on the uh you know 2.4 and 2.1 on the Wi-Fi 5 GHz so that 5 GHz frequency is actually broadcast or able to back call much higher performance so if I lose performance going from 5 gz 5 gigahertz I'm still over a gigabit per second even I went a third hop I'd still be over a gigabit per second whereas the 2.4 gigz you can see is only connecting at you know almost 600 Mega megabits per second and so um but you will lose performance uh when you every additional hop and then if you're sharing a radio if I'm if I'm connecting mesh on 2.4 and5 and then I'm broadcasting an SSID on 2.4 and5 then that is sharing the the power of that radio which will lower the throughput so even though I'm negotiating at 2.4 gigabits per second I would not be able to achieve 2.4 gigabits on the client side due to the fact that some of that radio is being used for the meshing as a client itself um and so there are are some nuances uh to that and because it's so variable it's it's not fun to say but sometimes they say you know you should estimate around 50% degradation um per hop um that's kind of a good line of sight I've seen better results and worse results depending on where your environment um but it is important to know that that you want to so I'm driving up to to Wisconsin right now and we're doing a mesh Network I'm using five gz as my back haul so I'm only doing 5 gigz for the mesh and then I'm broadcasting at 2 .4 GHz that way I'm dedicating the 2.4 GHz channel to Wi-Fi and then I'm using the really highspeed 2.5 gigabits per second 5 gigahertz frequency to provide the back hall throughput that way I can mesh further away and still provide you know 600 megabits per second of 2.4 gigahertz to the clients um and there's a whole bunch of different use cases and reasons for different scenarios but this I've got to cover a huge outdoor area and 2.4 GHz goes further and and that's just the the decision that we made but the point though is is that you want to take those things into consideration when you're designing a network um yeah the Wi-Fi radio can only transmit or receive at any Split Second right so it it can talk or it can listen just like you know when you're having a conversation you talk and listen right you have to kind of like take turns in that exchange but when you so the 2.4 GHz radio can talk L and talk L and but then like Peter said he's using the 5 GHz radio to mesh so the clients can talk and they can immediately relay that back so it can hear that transmit that on the other frequency because it's using two radios then and so that takes some of those bottlenecks out of out of the equation on the mesh side um but there's again a lot of details to all this there's people that have dedicated their entire careers to setting up mesh networks and Wi-Fi networks and so we could spend a whole week on this topic if we really wanted to get into the Weeds on this and designing for this scenario or that scenario but and that's why this is a tool of you know lower preference compared to just hardwiring your your access points you don't have to really talk about any of this stuff if you just plug them all in but exactly not always possible um Tom asked a really good question too uh he said you know can we use the the landan WAN port on the AP 100% so once I've disconnected that AP from my router I could now plug a laptop or a switch into that a one of those remote APS and extend an infrastructure wirelessly so you can plug in cameras phones Etc and then basically wire wired hand off on that mesh Network so if I plugged in a switch to 4 d75 right here I could then have devices ethernet devices connected that are then connected via this wireless mesh that has redundant paths back to 6825 um and so that is some benefit there to meshing um that you can definitely do um how will this work with existing spanning tree [Music] infrastructure I'm guessing that the spanning tree Bridge ID was the same between the the switches and the access points or something along those lines I I get what he's Matthew's getting at you're very vendor specific and like kind of like hard to predict exactly vendor to vendor on that um I don't know frankly you definitely want to make sure you're not looping switches so if you're meshing and then you have two switches and those switches are connected and then you're meshing you got to make sure spanning tree is is set up properly um so that you don't create a a loop but a proper spanning tree deployment should fix that for you um so it's just making sure you have the the priority ID um or the priority spaning tree priority on the switches at a different rate so the closer you are to the router the the lower the or the higher I guess the lower the priority number would be like you know 4,000 instead of 16,000 um so you should be like you know 4096 when it's really close to your your router and then the further you're away that priority should be a higher number um kind of like getting that away from your netork work like I'm further away no we don't we don't support oh is this a 160 no I think we support 20 40 and 80 megahertz um so we don't we don't support 160 yet right right that would be Wi-Fi s if I'm not mistaken that I have to I'd have to ask gedris we support 20 40 and 80 though we don't support 160 yet 80 sure but yeah I think you're right yeah yes uh uh someone uh someone says uh we keep the Hops to a minimum you should definitely keep the Hops to to a minimum you know if you can have wired devices and then extend out um at minimal Hops uh you're going to have the best performance you know hit that hit those one or two areas that are further away um but if you can produce the Hops it's going to be better with these three access points if you took it if you look at like the the base that has the internet connection that's like 100% the first hop is going to be 50% the next hop is going to be another minus 50% and so that's going to be 25% is your best case scenario that that second hop would have would be 25% of the throughput of a normal hardwired AP so again that's your best case if your mesh links are perfect and your client to AP path is perfect a two hop node is going to at best have 25% of the throughput of a wired AP so pops are bad for Speed now that may not matter if you've got a one megabit device that needs to connect or you know a bunch of low throughput devices that may be no big deal but if you're trying to you know max out the throughput of a traditional access point mesh is g to take that speed way down really fast and so it just depends on what you're trying to do and that's also why 5 gigz matters um and six G you know and six you know in the future here six gigz matters because you're going to be able to get that higher base rate so as you go hop further down you know taking a 50% of 2.1 gigabit U or 2.4 you see that's only that's 1,00 megabits per second uh link speed so so then my next one is 600 megabits per second so three hops is 600 megabits per second at which is the same as one hop on a 2.4 GHz frequency um and and so I can go three hops on five GHz and equal or exceed a single hop of 2.4 GHz um and so if I were to take the 2.4 GHz and span that out one hop my next connections would be at 300 megabits per second um and so you just got to pay attention to the fact that um every additional hop is g to uh be affected by link speed and so that's why especially um someone asked about you know 160 mahz frequency or you know if the more frequency we can get the more throughput we we're going to be able to achieve the better it's going to hand uh be able to mesh out and then that also goes into like I said if we when you when Wi-Fi 7 comes out and things like that we have a six gigahertz Channel we'll even be able to have even more capacity um than you know than we have now but but 5 gigahertz at you know 2.4 gigabits per seconds uh you know pretty good especially when you're talking about a mesh Network and back hall to gigabit Ethernet ports um okay so um we did have some some standard question answers but you guys answered most of them but you know how many hops can this be supported it's not advised to have more than two to three Hops and we just did the math to show you that um I we've done some some testing uh validation and and you can get more than that but the performance starts to drop so like Travis said you could have iot devices that only need a little bit of throughput that you could pop more but you're going to you're GNA sacrifice capacity dramatically as you get to those fourth and fifth hops um are there any limitations to the hub device um if the if the Hub device has a direct Gateway it depends on which radio frequencies The Hub can support um once again making sure that that five gigz or that Wi-Fi 6 versus you know um a an ax AP versus an acap right so if you're running like a 20x with an acap and you're trying to mesh Wi-Fi 6 devices the ax APS um you're not going to get the same uh frequencies and capacity so you want to mesh like devices so you want to make sure you have a Wi-Fi 6 Hub with Wi-Fi 6 spokes um uh so you want to you know like if you have a br2 pro or a br1 pro those are Wi-Fi 6 you're going to be able to mesh those with um other Wi-Fi the apxs or Wi-Fi 6 devices um the other note that I thought was pretty cool that engineering put together was talking about the mimo so the ax AP is a 4x4 mimo but the br1 br2 and the ax light are 2 by two mimo so you have more the ax AP is going to be able to mesh at higher capacity than a 2X two mimo device um once again that goes back to what Travis was talking about when we were talking about talking sending and receiving and the ability to do those simultaneous Communications the ax AP is going to handle that way better than a 2 by two mimo device yeah I think it's kind of like you know we start at some number and then each hop is going to take you down lower and lower and so if your if your gateway That Base access point only has 2 by two your base number is cut in half already so again there's just a lot of interplay and it's it's just kind of a a waterfall or a domino effect and so the the stronger the base the the better the endpoint connection will be on the other side and you know so on down the chain exactly um are there any performance I think we already talked about that enough so they they put it in writing for us but the the idea is the what you we've already talked about Dr ically um are there any rebroadcast limitations and we talked about that as well um just paying attention to the fact that if you're using 5 gz for mesh and then you're using 5 gigahertz for rebroadcast you're cutting that radio capability in half um yeah and so now we can answer questions it's a rather rather simple topic or short straightforward topic um MH uh let's see yeah there's a lot of mesh Solutions uh somebody kind of had a had a mesh question there um are vilans trunked over the mesh this is Layer Two so vlans should be uh it should be it should be treated like a a layer two handoff so I think I I actually should test that Travis I don't know if you know but the VLAN should should pass through it through it positive the answer is yes to that you can yeah switch in and trunk through that because you know similarly you can have multiple ssids mapped to different vlans as well um so I'm like 95% sure that's a yes but I I'll have I'll have to hook up a switch and test it I I will uh Tom I will test that for you and that's a that's a great question but I'm 95% because you could do ssids with tagging and mesh works over the ssids so those vlans should pass through just fine uh but I have not actually tested that in my lab environment um most of what I do is ethernet based uh when it Cox and then roaming um so uh most of my Enterprise deployments are all going to be hardwired APS but I will check that but but I know you can set up ssids with tag fand tagging and those work over um mesh so so the answer should be yes um but good good question see heroi mentioned there was an old deployment heroi and I worked together I think 15 years ago AG go on a Wi-Fi mesh Network and so that was 802 111g it was a single radio 2.4 GHz and we had I think 350 mesh nodes over a city doing Wi-Fi coverage and so it was like one to two megabit service for for Internet service but yeah it's uh the technolog has come a long ways and so this is a a much faster much more modern version of that but it was a same concept that many years ago but just way better Hardware capabilities now today um I kind of mentioned this already uh JC but Wi-Fi um you can mesh um Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 5 but it's recommended you mesh like devices so mesh Wi-Fi 5 with five mesh Wi-Fi 6 with six um because you're going to be degraded in performance you're not going to get the Wi-Fi 6 performance meshing to a Wi-Fi five so like if you have the AP1 Enterprise mesh that with other AP1 Enterprises um try not to mesh that with ax um because you're going to basically lose the performance of it there's there's so many details that are going to play out in terms of like what you use as the bass what you use as the nodes and there's just so many variables and differences but they're all compatible it's just going to have differences in speed when you have different combinations in there so yeah and Wi-Fi and and the AP1 Enterprise um Wi-Fi 5 does support meshing so you you can mesh that like if you have a um like I mentioned earlier but if you have a balance 20x which is Wi-Fi 5 you can you can mesh that with AP1 Enterprises or AP1 lights if you have a br1 you should me you could mess that with Wi-Fi 6 so a ax and ax light um so You' be able to mesh um but you can also mesh Wi-Fi 6 to Wi-Fi 5 like so you're just not going to have the performance any other questions or I'll give people back some time this is I think the first time we've ever finished early but we'll give it a minute or so for any additional questions but um awesome well thank you so much uh for for reaching out CJ if you email uh email me pwest networks.com uh about the vlans I I will I will lab that I also create a YouTube video about it I'll take two two pepeling switches and mesh them and then make sure the VLAN span but I'm 99% sure that it it'll work um because we've done ssids um so but like 99% sure it'll work but uh but if you email me I'll send you a link to a YouTube video uh where I I'll do two two switches two APS mesh them and trunk some vlans across it cool Peter and okay well thank you everybody and have a great day and thank you so much um as always uh you can email Travis pink.com uh Peter West networks.com and um and ask any additional questions or if you have any if you need help uh please let us know uh we can always get you with a partner in your region and uh little tag out there if you like this information you like

agent Adam and I'm Joey and I'm looking forward Adam to talking about all peplink with you um we have some great topics to cover today isn't it yeah we really got a lot to talk about we've spent the past few days going through all the things that we'd like to talk about in this podcast so let's get on with the first one so for today we start with the Ping stories ping stories is a a topic that we want to discuss all of the pink stories that we make that we we like to talk about uh right Adam absolutely there's a lot of things that you and I do with peplink all the time and it's really nice to be able to share with the community the fun that we've had with peplink the challenges that we've set ourselves and what we've completed and we're going to try and make these as relevant and as recent as possible and I think the first one we want to kick off with is something that you and I did recently at Frontier Tech conference and that would be one 101 we call it you want to explain to everyone rough a little bit about one 101 and what it actually is yes on when 101 is the to see how much we can do with the pink how how far can we stress the machines to see where it breaks yeah absolutely I mean for this scenario we thought we'd take the epx and see how many WS we can actually put into this epx and small spoiler alert uh the number was 101 but how did we get there how how did we get to 101 ws and more importantly why what is the point of putting 101 WS into a single epx well there are a few challenges with that um looking at Power how can we power such enormous uh when solution and um the amount of cables that we needed to to make this work it's um it's you don't think of it at first but then once you're working on it it's like yeah this is a lot of cables yeah it was it was in the way that we did it there was definitely a lot of cables I can't even remember how many there was but I'm going to guess there was about 100 or so cables fact there must have been almost double that CU we had to Loop through switches yes yes we did but we luckily had some fertile went so uh it was it I think we used about 50 cables because we could do SFP from the switches to the apx to push a lot of those virtual uh lands to that and use it as a virtual land so was it was it was a very exciting thing perhaps we should recreate that actually for one of the podcasts in the future and we'll actually go through how we did that config and how we achieved 101 w now there's two things that I'd like to highlight on this one is why would we do something like this and I don't think the reason is just because we can you've already touched a little bit on this before it's pushing those limits of peplink and what peplink can actually do with the software in hand uh a lot of the stuff is theoretical peplink can do this peplink can do that so to actually take it to those extremes helps us understand better what the equipment can do as well as helping peplink themselves make things more stable there's a few things that we discovered on this one weren't there Joey that we had some fun with some challenges to actually make the thing work uh We've written a few down here they've actually covered off in the latest firmware that we're going to speak about later but should we just go through a couple of these things that we found yes yeah there's there's like even the peping guys from the support team were also really interested and and really helpful with this to see if we can make it better or even try to solve out the issues of course that or the challenges that we that we got and so one of the things that we figured out was um and I have to look in the notes for this one um added support for removing synergized devices and their corresponding WS in Synergy modes so as soon as you you swap devices because we started with three hd4 mbx synergized on that apx right then we figured out that it three was a bit too much uh syz devices on that because you're you're talking about then 20 or something for uh added W with the Synergy mode so um to make it a bit more stable we cut that down to two mbx which was still enough and added some Wi-Fi when instead of only the cellulars and the and the fix WS on the mbx um we decided to add some more a port cards in it to actually give us more physical ports rather than synergized devices and that's when we discovered the first issue yes yes indeed um so now you were able to remove synergized devices and their corresponding winds even though your devices is running so you don't need to reset for example we had to reset the apx every time you synergize something it remembers those WS even though you've taken the synergized device out it remembers those ws and there is a finite limit to how many WS you can have in an epx yes yes that's when we figured it out so um I think this is a really good question to the listeners and the viewers to find out if you can guess what the maximum epx can handle let us know in the comments or email us or or whatever how many WS do you think an epx can support and we'll answer that in the next podcast episode so the second one of course uh one of the big things of of the new firmware release that we're going to talk about later um the enhanced stability to prevent an necessary Synergy when disconnects I think if you you synergize three mxs that we did at first um there's a lot of like things that can and will go into a way that um they are disconnecting all the time these sellers and that was pretty random for us at the beginning and then they figured it out that um there were some things that are unnecessary disconnected uh by the pep link and that's why we helped them fix this uh this issue that could happen to to a device but now we figured it out by stress testing the the pink and this of course you know it goes back to what we said before this really helps peplink themselves the support team to actually see what those extreme scenarios are and to make it more stable for the rest of the community so if we come back to why do we actually do things like this it is for the greater good it is to help peplink uh as well as showing ourselves what the capability of these devices really are and I have to say for me the epx really didn't disappoint on this no especially not I was like I was skeptic at first like can we really really do this um because we've we've tried this before right we we've tried this I think a year before we tried this before I did try doing a 100 WS at a conference in Tampa with Frontier us and we tried to set up a 100 WS there and there was just we just couldn't do it we did achieve it later on in the year um but you know in a year's time it's brilliant how much more stable the platforms become to allow us to do crazy things like this yes I I think that was that was still an 8.3.0 wasn't it do you know I can't remember it may even have been before okay well also there's a um case study on that on the pink website as well with case studies so somebody is interested in that with some pictures as well so next Joey I would like to talk about the upcoming firmware release 8.5.0 and I know that both you and I have been very excited about this because we have been going through these release not almost weekly sending each other messages about things that excite us things that are really going to change the world of how we use peplink so let's kick off with some of these that interest us I I really want to talk through a few of these and I'm going to Chuck the first one over to you and we're going to talk about adaptive forward error correction you want to tell us about what that is and why it's so exciting yes um I've been I've been waiting for this for over a year now uh pushing the Ping team to about this because uh what we what we found out during ponding is that Thea air correction pushes everything over all the vans so if one van in your bonding solution is not performing as as it should be the Forward Air correction applies it to all vs and with dynamically adapting the forward error correction it only applies that to that specific when so it's pretty good improved and U maybe I should touch a bit on what is forward error correction forward error correction is a feature within uh the pink that allows you to retransmit packages if they are lost between one pink and the other in your speed Fusion VPN so that's that's what forward a correction is and with this Dynamic version of it which is I like to call it the 2.0 for a correction um and it and it only applies then basically to that specific W so the other WS will perform as good as they uh they can be I mean there was always forward error correction before in the previous versions and I've heard about people having success with this with starlink particularly on uploads being able to get larger amounts of data through so I can see the advantage of being able to vary each connection to get the best out of it absolutely brilliant sounds like a bit of a game changer for me that yeah this is really really good feature to start um in 8.5.0 with yeah really good shall I take one next let's talk about Synergy mode eim management so this is the ability to be able to manage eims on synergized devices I feel like that was almost a tongue twister but I think I got it right so this goes back to when I was trying to manage some eims on a synergized device and in this scenario I had a B1 that was connected to a br1 mini and the br1 mini was synergized and I was trying to manage the eim on that device and I just couldn't do it and this is actually one of those examples of the peplink support team about how you go to them you say I've got this problem I need to be able to do this and they were very quick and they came back and they said yeah do you know what we know exactly what's wrong here's a little custom firmware for you give this ago this will probably work and we see these little custom firmwares all getting wrapped up in the latest firmware releases so it's really good to see this one's actually there and it's now very simple with that synergized device you can add the eims you can remove the eims absolutely brilliant we we we probably don't praise the uh peplink support team enough and we probably actually praise them too much don't we so some of the features that are actually in this firmware are also from the guys from peplink asking on the forum for example the the starlink ones that um that we want to talk about as well Adam this is this the Wi-Fi W one actually I I only raised this on the Forum a couple of days ago and somebody from peplink did comment and basically hinted said just wait just wait it's coming it's coming and I see on rc3 there it is so we can Now display the starlink status from a Wi-Fi one before it could only be done from a physical device now it can be done from a Wi-Fi one and this was important because I just take and delivery of my new starlink Mini not trying to show off everyone will have one soon but that has an integrated Wi-Fi one router and I think a lot of people are going to want to be able to connect to that on their pep links using the Wi-Fi one and not using the cable so to have that feature of being able to display the starlink status the same as you can with a wire device just in The Logical wave to go for me yeah it's so cool let's let's stick on starlink then Joey because you've you've picked out a nice little starlink one we've got starlink GPS support yes starlink GPS support I think this is a really good one and this especially for me when I'm dealing with um some some questions from customers that were like what did this the device do on this certain um location or time we want to add that to the in control reporting so if we can get a GPS from a stalling into a B1 that doesn't have a GPS module we can use that location from the stalling to see what happened at that time at that location we can see if there's obstruction we can see if there's something that is is abnormal to that location so yeah this really helps out with a lot of the support from from our side I think it's really good CU there's a lot of peplink devices out there that don't have GPS and perhaps even don't need GPS um I'm thinking about the balance series but it's actually quite good that you can now get that GPS information and it's an automatic thing as well there's nothing really to configure for this is it it just works okay and another one I've got on theist list here is called failover mode now Joey tell us all about what this one is I know it excites you a lot yes yes I've been looking through the release notes and I think this run is really exciting the reason for it is you want to save some money wherever possible right you don't want to consume data that you don't want to use specifically so enabling called failover mode turns off your link failure detection for standby when to links within your speed Fusion tunnel so let's say you want don't want to use the star link yet you want to use it once the cell kicks out then you want to not use that priority data that you have within your sty link uh bundle and then you don't want to spend it let's rephrase it like this you don't want to spend it in a hot standby mode sorry and then from that hot standby mode you can change it now into a cold standby mode so you don't do any health checks over that as soon as it is in the lower priority but as soon as it kicks in um you can you can use it as a when Source within your speed Fusion tunnel so the next topic we're going to cover is peplink news so this is going to be things that have happened with peplink this month maybe some future stuff that we found out about and the first one I'm going to go into is um I don't know if you know Joey I've just become a father again and as part of the responsibility of being a father it's very important to develop dad jokes so I'm going to try this one out on you I'm going to try one each episode so this is one this is a bit of a shout out to the peplink engineers so why don't peplink Engineers like going to the Jungle because of all the bugs I've okay okay all right should I should I rate those yeah I'll rate that eight out of 10 eight eight that's a good that's a good strong one look if anybody else has got ideas for jokes please do let me know uh and you know what I might choose your joke on the next podcast but each I'm going to do a joke each time the dad jokes are going to get better and better so should we continue with the real peping news now not my news and let's start with new devices um I suppose we can very quickly touch on some new information that we found out recently about a new 5G modem that's coming to peplink very soon and I think we even spotted some bits relating to it in the release notes didn't we uh the affectionately called 5gk modem yes yeah when when you stare at those release notes for hours a day don't tell the boss but um yeah it the boss knows you find out some things you find out some things and um yeah we we found out that the the new and this is break breaking news do we have some title in below are like breaking news yes so we don't know an awful lot about this 5gk modem at the moment other than it is a vendor that peplink has worked with before and they've certainly had cat 18 versions of the modem I know and there's some other 4G variants they've had so it is a tried and tested modem and now they've got a 5G version that they're using and it seems to be more feature Rich than other 5G modems they currently use yes especially on the back end what I've heard is that it is um way more able to find and and fill in the needs that peplink has on the back end and then we talking about remote Sim Fusion Sim eim all of those features that that the modem provides and P link Builds on those things are probably better with this 5gk modem so I think we both really look forward to getting hold of one of these as soon as possible and start playing with it ourselves and hopefully we can share our findings with the pep link podcast very very soon and and another bit of news which could be old news or new news depending on when this podcast actually comes out but I've heard today that the peplink eim is going to be available for non peplink devices so you'll be able to use it in another router that can use an eim or even your mobile phone cellular phone depends on how you call it depends what part of the world that you're from but you'll actually be able to use those same tariffs already available on peplink on another device that's interesting I I didn't know that but uh that's that's still cool so I can swap my esm from uh my bo1 Pro 5G to my phone I mean in theory I mean what you could have is pull data so you could use the same pool of data from your b15g and your phone so it doesn't matter if you're using your B1 if you're traveling around on your phone and you're still using the same data that You' bought really good if you're going roaming if you're going to another country and for some reason you chose not to take your pep link with you I always travel with my pep link to be honest and while we're talking about eims I'm going to jump onto a section that we've called tips and tricks by Adam and Joey maybe we'll come up with a more catchy name but let's stick with that for now uh this is about installing eims on on to peplink devices and we've discovered something I say discovered we probably should have known this anyway but let's say that we've discovered it I was always under the impression the only way to install an eim was to have another internet connection active to be able to download that eim to a device but we got hold of the max adapter we plugged in the max adapter the max adapter only has one internet connection so we thought how on Earth do you install an eim onto this Max adapter when you've only got the one internet connection that you're using already to have internet and again backwards and forwards a few times with the peplink support team and we suddenly realized that as long as the device is already connected using an eim so whether that's the peplink eim or another eim that's already on there because it's already in eim mode you can add and remove eims as long you don't remove the one that you're currently using but it does let you manage eims with only that one single connection and I've now tested this on all the devices uh HD1 Dome and b1s and it's true absolutely works so nice little tip and trick there for eim management when you've only got one internet connection also maybe good to know because I honestly thought as well like you need to have a secondary when uh like a cellular or a fixed one or Wi-Fi went to upload that that eim but if you already have an eim uploaded you can have within every pep link except the max adapter you can have two bring your own eims per modem so you can have one eim could also be a third option is a pink eim of course that doesn't count towards those two you can have one eim and then upload another one and then it switches over when it's it's uh completed the download of the eim profile so do cool do did you know Joey if that's actually a limitation of the hardware that it only lets you have two eims or is it possible do you think in the future to have more eims there there is a possibility I I know from early eim talks a few years back that the hardware limit was about eight but it really depends on what kind of Hardware is used and maybe peplink uses the with the 5G modems or the 4G modems there's only room for for two of those uh eims and with a p eim now what would be really really exciting Joey is if you could have something like a uh a remote eim Hub somewhere like the remote Sim injector and wouldn't it be great if you could have one that actually had eims on the remote injector instead then there'd be no limit to how many eims you could use on a device true true but um I think the eims are uploaded to a specific part of Hardware within the um cellular area so it's not like remote eim or sorry remote Sim like the Sim injector does where you have another different part of hardware on the PCB of the P link but uh this is something related to with or I must say this is within the the cellular module so it's it's a different place on the on the board but it yeah it could be and there is um always people ask asking uh that kind of stuff the the question is always like why do you need it well I think I think it's amazing how I it feels like in the space of a year that we've gone from having almost two or three Sims available per modem to about seven or eight Sims available per modem depending on how you inject them and if you're using something like Fusion Sim really you've technically got unlimited number of Sims but there's so many tick boxes on the device now when you go into that web management and you look at the cell there's so many options with priority now and it's it's brilliant it just gives you so so much Choice yes it's you have those A and B priorities then you got remote Sim pink eim then you have the bring your own eim of course yeah this it improved a lot over the years and I think probably the biggest news story that we've already alluded to earlier on is the release of 8.5.0 yes how exciting is this I mean the release notes now is is ridiculous number of pages I've got 24 pages here of release notes so I I don't know how they could call it a minor release when there's so much extra feature improvements fixes and everything and you know this is all included as part of your Prime care anyway there's no extra charges to keep getting these firmware releases are there correct yeah there's uh you just need to be uh compatible the device needs to be compatible I know from the last update or like the the update 8.3.0 that firmware really was a limitation for a lot of older um Legacy products you can find that uh on the release notes as well there's a whole list of devices with all the hardware versions that are not longer supported um by 8.4.0 or 8.3.1 for some devices um so so from 8.4.0 there's a a cut off a really good example this as well I know you've got I've missed this on your tips and tricks and the transit Pro duo with 8.5 tell us about what's new with the transit Pro Duro with 8.5 yes from 8.5.0 the transit Duro Pro doesn't need Prime care for Speed Fusion technology so one of the first Prime Care devices the the the transit versions um they they were the first one to be able to have speed Fusion features without needing to purchase a an expensive license you just add the the the Prime Care subscription that you need to renew to keep using the speed Fusion uh Technologies from now on in 8.5.0 you don't need to have the Prime Care renewed so that's a really good change and really allows transit to excel in this really competitive peplink lineup well thank you peplink that's a that's a nice little gift for us all I suppose yes you find a lot of things in the those release notes Adam well Joey got some really interesting stuff we covered this week and look forward to doing more in the future with you uh those obviously features that interest us there's going to be features that interest other people as well and we really want to hear about those yes and if you want to be a guest on the show you want to tell you about your ping stories for example like we did with the w 101 you can find uh the contact details in the description below if you're watching this on YouTube or find us on LinkedIn send us a message on Instagram as well I think it it was wonderful talking to you Adam and I'm can't wait for your next Adam joke thank you Joey and I really look forward to the next podcast which I hope will be real soon thank you very much bye-bye [Music]"}

Professor p and today we're talking firmware 850 this is this is uh pretty exciting as well there's a there's a lot I love it when peplink releases these major firm firmware versions because all the community feedback and the feature requests everything starts to kind of come together from all these special builds and and projects that we're working on and they get all rolled up into these big firmware packages and um it's it's always really exciting to be able to to share all these special projects and case studies and how we have used these features and pinks listening to the community and and pushing out Hardware or not Hardware while they do push out Hardware but pushing out all these features into a major R firmware rollup yeah and I think you you really hit the the nail on the head it's like this is all driven by the community right people are driving these projects these these needs and you know we're driving these new capabilities with carrier Partners out there and so there's just a ton of stuff in here to to dig into um I think we're ready to go we got a lot of people on the line thanks everybody for joining thank you once again Travis for hosting I I I I look forward to my my my my Tuesday Tuesday Travis time so it's always kind of fun and um start talking about all this stuff and get get Pink's Insight on all the stuff that we're working on I mean I know peplink listens but but also you taking the time to kind of like collaborate on okay because it's like what I do and my customers and my small niche in in my area but then I get Pink's feedback and what all your involvement with all the other Community Partners and everything we're doing around the world um and getting some further insight into these Technologies and and feature sets so yeah it's always it's always the community okay so 8.5 is launching we're in r C2 right now um I've been following this since um since uh uh beta 1 and I've have been playing around with some of the features and I always like to show some of uh show this if you haven't if you don't know how to do it so I'm gonna um o sorry get out of uh this mode uh so if if you're interested in this you go to in control um so I'm in my uh my speed Fusion Fleet and so you can go to settings firmware policy and then you can click show beta firmware scroll down agree do not push this out to production if you're running a a large 200 site retail don't don't go do this right now um let let let us be your guinea pigs and and work through this but all the enthusiasts out there your Labs um your your homes uh where you're playing around with these features uh you click yes and I agree to to to accept all the risk and then you'll be able to select the latest beta firmware but more importantly you'll be able to over here on the right hand side download the release notes and so once we have the release notes we can see everything that's happening here and it's important on these release notes number one you you need to pay attention to the release notes because if you're using rsim or the Sim injector every single firmware update includes a note about the Sim injector Associated firmware there's also notes about which Hardware is going to be depreciated which Hardwares are eligible for the next major updates so you can kind of forecast Pink's road map hey which Hardware is not being released in the next major this is the last supported firmware for the you know whatever old one some some peplink router it's all going to be notated here in the release notes so you can see here's devices supported by this firmware um and then important notices uh the configuration for 83 or above with firmware eight uh sorry uh it won't work with 83 you have to have a configuration for 83 or above um so it's not compatible with firmware 8.2 or below our Sim if you're using art Sim or the Sim injector you need to run the new firmware 1137 so you'll download that update your sim injector first then update to the 8.5 firmware um and control must be enabled for Prime car for update software features um and then you'll see uh F uh sorry f future further major firmware will not be supported on the following models and so here's our routers they're being depreciated with this firmware and that's important to to note to note especially in your Enterprise or if you have a whole bunch of routers these routers are being depreciated so you don't have to go and go okay which routers are being end of life in the next year or the next quarter you have it right here these these routers aren't going to be able to sustain uh any further firmware updates and that's important to notice um then if you scroll down we're can get all the new features and we're going to go over most of these so I'm not going to go over these in the um right now but the um but then if we scroll down more we have improvements and this is kind of cool if you download this during the the beta stage or the release candidate stage you can actually see in which firmware release they fixed this so rc1 they added clo CLI support and rc2 they added API for uh Factory restoring the routers and so you can see as they as they're developing these firmware mod these beta firmwares you can actually see when these features got added so once again if you're an Enthusiast it's kind of fun to see um once they go into the general the ga build or the the release build all of those notes go away and you just basically get all the feature releases but lots of improvements um and fixes and so if I scroll down these are all just improvements that's what I think that was four pages of improvements then we have resolved issues and you know once again one two three four five six seven8 nine 10 11 12 and a half 12 and a quarter 12 and a fifth Pages uh well I guess that's 12 because that's just going on there so 12 pages of improvements from Community feedback bug releases that you've fixed and you can see right here fixed in special build s052 um special build s101 so if you were part of this you created this this capability helping us uh go through these fixes but 12 pages of fixes so I highly advise um skimming through that if you have time okay let's get to the cool stuff now what's new in 8.5 um that's going to be exciting to talk about so the first thing is we are improving outbound policies traffic shaping um to the the least used algorithm now reports cellular WS um this has been requested probably for three or four firmwares now um and it's neat really to see that this got pushed into uh the uh 8.5 firmware so now you can do least used which has been available for a long time but only on ethernet ws and then last firmware they added the VLAN as wan to least used they add added buy Uplink so uh we got the Uplink capability um and now they've added a cellular WS so you'll be able to choose your cellular ws and load balance least used on your um cellular ws and this is really good if you're traffic shaping across diverse internet connections and you're basically trying to take maximum advantage of all available bandwidth um for for a large group I always think when we're talking about getting the most bandwidth out of every circuit and you're not trying to aggregate for like teams and zoom but you just want your Instagram and your your regular internet brow brow to be uh responsive it's good actually to load balance that and how you load balance that matters and so load balancing in combination with bonding actually creates the best enduser experience possible and least used basically every new session every new request to the internet the router says okay which internet connection is being used the least right now by either down link or Uplink go oh cellular 3 is currently being used the least that request will go outside cellular 3 so you're always getting that new thread or that new session happening on the internet connection being utilized the least and and that's a neat feature and it's I'm really excited to see that that came to the um that is now available on uh uh cellular circuits yeah and I think that's a great Point like like you said Peter you don't have to bond everything right and that's kind of people's default is just Bond everything and protect it all and yeah for bulk internet traffic an intelligent load balancing algorithm like this is a great way to take advantage of both connections but also really keep those priority applications for the bonding and the tunneled protection 100% um and and yeah it's just it's just a great great feature okay so next um auto power adjustment and roaming for Wi-Fi um this is awesome I was actually just doing a competitive project with another manufacturer and they said well power routers will Auto auto autotune power and uh I reached out to P I was like Hey do you anything know about this autot tuning of power and they go just wait a second and then I got this the release notes for 8.5 I was like yes um and I was able to go back to the customer uh and say hey we we now have that as well um currently this is only available on the router we we hopefully we'll get this on in control soon I I did reach out to peplink for feedback on that um and I I believe this is being added um to the next build of in control as you know in control also has software versions so we're on um uh two. 2.13 um and so this this feature will be added but right now it's on the AP controller settings on the router you can now go to ro assisted roaming and actually put in um the uh the the ability to help assist in roaming uh as devices move around your network and so it's more efficient roaming for your devices and so it's a great way to help clients move um from it and you can see right here that say you know conservative isga 70 DB moderate isga 65 and aggressive is Nega 55 and so typically the way we used to do this in the past with roaming was that we would have to go in and set the radio settings it's set the minimum client threshold so i' say minimum client threshold um to 71 and that would basically force it to roam over and make a more uh clean roaming environment now you can do this automatically with the assisted roaming feature yeah this is nice it just helps you know you end up with like APS that are just in a more popular location and they'll end up with more clients than you know there'll be a really lightly used one within range oftentimes and yeah this just share the load and yeah the power tuning is is really powerful too because I think the Wi-Fi nerds out there know like when you've got a whole bunch of Wi-Fi users and APS more power is a problem right you're saturating the airwaves quickly and so when you can be more intelligent about how much power you use to you don't need to shout loud to somebody who's close and so gives you a lot efficient use of that airspace so a combination of uh power power coverage redundancy and assisted roaming really brings that that package together for you and allows you to have a a nice roaming environment where you don't have too much power overlap which gives you better signal a better Channel distribution um and then better better roaming and so it just brings those Enterprise features uh to to to everybody basically to the consumer in this case because peplink uh has a lot of consumers that want those Enterprise features yeah Enterprise is the word this is you know Pink's had this Enterprise Wi-Fi product line forever and this just further elevates it into that Enterprise feature set with all the other Solutions out there and on that if there are Enterprise customers watching this there's no licensing feed for this it's literally you just go and install 3.9.4 AP firmware and 8.5 and boom you're done um so it's not like oh by the way you can now have assisted roaming and that's this license fee nope it's just peplink thought it' be cool to add and so they add it which I I just think is really neat the way peplink does Licensing in that in that fashion so the question on this security the firmware updates I can take that one um perect peplink has a just Stellar track record of providing those critical security features back to these older platforms and so I don't know what the next vulnerability may be that comes out but in years past there were industrywide like Wi-Fi or SSL types of vulnerabilities and we went back and created a special Point release for these older platforms and so that that's a precedent we set in the past and I expect we'll maintain that in the future but that's an example of how we handle those situations so yeah new products get all the new features and new firmware versions very frequently and the old depreciated ones will get very infrequent critical updates that will still be relevant for those older Hardware platforms as you know those situations happen I mean on that I remember when we were in like firmware 7even and there was a critical security vulnerability and we released like a 4.5.5 or some ridiculously old firmware to address a secure like uh like a you know a critical issue in that firmware um so so if there is a a critical issue on on active devices they will actually go back and passive so you'll still get critical security but not the regular everyday features and capabilities yep exactly um and then uh two people talked about least used um with least used it is based on bandwidth um so it's it's based on available bandwidth uh so and the reason why you don't do it by number of sessions is because if you have a gigabit circuit it can handle a whole lot more sessions than a 100 Meg 150 mag starlink and so basically it's you program your circuit speeds um on your Wan so if um I'm gonna actually show this because I think it's valuable um so I'll go to my backpack here so on my w I got my starlink here I click Wan one and right in there it's actually improperly set up so I could set this to 25 megabits by 250 megabits actually it's a startling mini so I could say 10 mags by 100 mags set the bandwidth of the MTU to 1500 and basically what least used would do is it' say okay I've got a 100 Megs available bandwidth on this starlink I've got you know and so it's going to look at which one percentage usage is less based on the available bandwidth of that circuit so if you improperly have your circuits defined and then you try to least used you might see an improper balance of your availab of your circuit utilization um so distribution I should say um so you definitely want to program the upload and download bandwidth and that way the router knows which one is being the use the least based on your available bandwidth for each circuit I'm not going to apply this because I'm actually using this router right now but I I will go back and fix that later okay so both of those are done sorry I'm just trying to catch on questions because these are good questions um someone asked how do you U help clients roam when the decision is made by the um is made solely by the client it's not really made by the client so the the AP and the client are talking to each other they're they're basically especially with the new roaming capabilities like like r u and I believe there's K now uh for roaming assistants I I don't not exactly I don't monitor those exactly but um the idea is that the router the AP and the client are talking to each other and so the what we're doing is telling the AP hey when you're at negative 71 DB we have a client that's a negative 71 DB tell it to switch push push it over there hey go go basically send a signal to it tell it to switch to a new AP um so the AP and the Cent and the AP does have to support or the client has to support roaming um so sometimes you'll see clients get disconnected you have to turn off roaming if you're running like a really Legacy Network because if the client's driver doesn't support roaming it's not going to work as well um as as clients that do support roaming Technologies um and and or uh yeah features and so um but it is kind of the the AP and the client talking to each other okay we're keep going with features we'll address some of those other questions I just want to make sure there's okay um yeah so Wi-Fi we'll go next um improv stability of uh Wi-Fi mesh connections this is a combination of 8.5 and 3.9.4 um so want to run uh W uh cellular wifi AP firmware 3.9 44 and um uh router firmware 8.5 and I posted on LinkedIn uh a couple weeks ago I was working on uh a mobile setup this with these cases a kind of a a mimic just a reminder for it but we were we were rolling out a a Wi-Fi mesh Network and the idea was that with the new 8.5 and 3.9 9.4 firmware we've got improved stability for wireless for mesh detection as well as the meshing UI has changed uh to show more information about the mesh so it shows its neighbors what the latency is to those NE neighbors what the connection capabilities are to those neighbors um and so they they're really improving meshing capabilities uh which is uh much much needed especially with all the the vendors out there pushing meshing uh it's nice to see that peplink is is moving forward with some improved mesh capabilities um I rolled up my very first one running 3.9.4 beta um and it was incredibly successful the network spun up very quick the discovery was faster um and so it was able to track those routes better as well um Travis that's really all I know about the meshing improvements I don't know if you have any more about that I I don't it's just I think a more of a kind of a backend or you know background type of improvement on the the software and the driver for the mesh algorithms but yeah I okay perfects so yeah so um another really cool thing I ignore starlink obstruction outages for more consistent reliabil connectivity uh I was doing a I was I don't know if you guys watched me on LinkedIn uh but I was out camping and I was playing around with one web and starlink I had a starlink mini um I'm actually running my starlink mini right now uh so if uh there's my uh starlink mini and my br2 uh I don't know if that showed up in the video for you guys or if it's just too small but um and uh and I noticed that the the connections I was in between trees and the trees were blocking uh my creating some obstruction as the starlinks moved across and it was creating a kind of I was saying obstructed and and an outage based on obstruction and sure enough loaded 8.5 checked the Box it showed up and so uh I can show you where that is on my router give me one second lost my mouse so in in your peplink router you go to network settings Wan and where you turn on your starlink you edit that option and you can actually ignore construction out uh obstruction outages you just check that box and hit save and basically what it's going to do is allow recovery quicker you're still going to have if there's an obstruction causing loss of data you're still going to have a blip during that obstruction what it's not going to do is turn off the WAN so it's going to keep the WAN up almost like like a persistence for a tolerance to keep it up and running uh during that obstructed outage um so you'd still have packet loss which is where FEC and Wan smoothing and bonding come into play but but it's not going to fail the W it's not going to create a whole bunch of up down on the w and it's going to keep that uh more stable for you um a new Improvement on the security side of it is we now we've added net flow to the br2 br1 mini uh Series so br1 mini br1 mini 5G core and MTM um netf flow has has really upped Pink's game in these uh cyber security and and um traffic monitoring and visibility uh game Space um so we've been able to to attract new Enterprise customers and security conscience customers with net flow and some of our features around that and that has been expanded to the br2 BR One Mini uh mini 5G core and MTM we have now added filtering access to your network by client type to make quick and easy firewall rules uh client type has been added over the last couple firmware features and we've added new features around client type um and client type is basically defining the type of client on your network and so now you can create firewall policies based on client types you can say cell phones can't access my servers that's kind of cool um so you could create fire firewall types that basically if someone's coming in with a cell phone or a tablet um it would basically uh allow or deny that traffic accordingly and I can't show you uh if I go to my my router and just go to status Client List you'll see that there's this type thing right here and so you can see there's my SP my smartphone and there's my two laptops my my PCS right there and they're showing showing up as desktops um and so in the firewall policies Network or Advanced firewall policies I can add a rule like an internal Rule and I could say uh cell phone block cell phone deny and I could basically say if the source client type is a cell phone smartphone deny that traffic in inside my network so so cell phones can go out to the internet but they can't talk to my servers or talk between vlans um so that's just a very simple uh example of this um but under client type there's a bunch of client types like uh printers so you could create hey allow printers but block um cell phones you know um and so e-readers SmartWatches audio video by the way that's TV so your smart TVs things like that um VoIP and then unclassified so if it's an unknown device um but you can see servers Network appliances so there's all these different um client types and you can actually create firewall rules based on type of device and that I I I think there's there's a really cool use case for that uh Travis I don't know if you have any specific uh use cases that you'd want to build on upon that but it's definitely neat the way they're adding that to outbound policies now firewall policies yeah I think I mean I think you've got a lot of scenarios where there's like public networks or even guest networks or just like keeping your kids device I mean I think there's a lot of ways people will use that creatively both in business and more personal environments but yeah it's I don't have an personal story of how I've used that yet I just love seeing it's just helpful for me just seeing the client type on the list is you know I look like if I see aice chewing through bandwidth it's really helpful to just see that icon and know like oh this is a phone somebody's watching a video okay someone's sucking up all my B video watching Instagram reals um yeah definitely someone asked um with about starlink obstruction uh why it's not always enabled you don't always want enabled if I'm being obstructed um and I and I have other means of Internet that that are more that that are more stable at the time I might want it to turn it off instead of having the packet loss associated the obstruction um and so it depends on how you're what type of traffic you're handling and how you want that to be handled so you some some users might want it to turn off that Wan and instead use um use the the other other sources of Internet some users might say hey all I have is starlink keep it up and running don't turn it off and that's really where that's at it's do I want it enabled or disabled based on my available internet sources yeah I think the the the thing there is like Star Link's terminal is at some point deciding at some threshold I'm obstructed and that threshold may be bouncing up and down quickly and instead of just assuming that that is really down you might be able to get a few more packets out than the terminal threshold would normally let you so you can kind of Che or the recovery yeah yep or the recovery time when it does go down it goes down and you have to wait for it to recover um and so it just speeds up recovery but but that's also if it is down and then you're waiting for to recover if you don't have any other internet that's a big outage if you have other Internet notless it's not that big of a deal let it let it fail and then let it come up healthy um and so it's not a it's not a big deal exactly um apple and Google's private Wi-Fi soone says how does this work with Apple's private Wi-Fi that's actually an outbound tunnel so so private Wi-Fi like from Google or or apple they're actually creating like a a tunnel and then tunneling you out so the device on the network is still the same and that would still apply even to um when you have the the random Mac addresses all it does is privatize your device it doesn't say it's it's not a smartphone um and so the randomized uh Mac addresses still show up as smartphones just not your smartphone every single time it's a private Mac address um so private Wi-Fi is an outbound uh setting which actually you could block with this Tech firewall feature you could block hey if it's a cell phone block IP SEC and now private Wi-Fi won't work anyways um but the idea is that you're identifying the client not the not the the the data path which is actually more beneficial to you it's I don't know U someone asked how do you know the client type I'm assuming it's based on Mac address is my guess uh if you use Mac spoofing it would probably because every Mac address is basically has the first um set of characters or actually the hardware identifier that's how they know hey this is a peplink or this is a Netgear or this is a Cisco um you know so you have like Samsung and and apple Etc um and so the those first digits are the hardware identifier and then the the last set of digits are basically the unique device identifier like this that's Peter's Mac uh iPhone or whatever and so they're probably using the first octet with a B database against vendors to associate um client type is my guess a good hacker could probably just change the MAC address on their device and and and circumvent it that's why you should have other security policies in place but it kind of it mitig the people that are just screwing around on your network um you know that kind of stuff yeah it's simple ways to categorize devices when you might not have another way to do it and like you said it's not going to be the end all Beall security policy for really critical stuff but it's definitely a huge convenience feature for these mixed use mixed user types of environments um Paul asked if uh netflow will be on other devices netflow is already on other devices it's very popular we've added it to these devices um uh in 8.5 firmware so so all of our Enterprise routers already have net flow support um we've just added it to the br1 mini and br2 uh for increased capabilities it's just hard to squeeze them into those smaller ones I think is what happened there we got there this is just showing you what I already showed you so you can see and you can actually change the client type as well of a device so if you're under The Client List you can click on client type and you have detect onment and then custom and so you can change it so if it does come unknown you can actually change the client type of a device so if a device is being improperly categorized um you can uh you can change that so if I go to my router go to status Client List I say this uh Surface Pro I can click on this detect automatically or I could say custom and I could change this to something else like iot for example and then that Mac address then would be Associated to iot in set of um a a desktop kind of cool feature there um receive gns and Nema uh messages for your GPS perfect user always on the go um we we have GPS receiver capabilities now meaning you can receive GPS signals from on non-gps routers um so if you have a GPS device and you have a non GPS router in other words a router without a cell cellular modem we now have the GPS receiver capabilities that you pull in GPS streams uh so kind of a cool feature for for more advanced users that are that are trying to track I can see this being used um an Enterprise Mobility where you maybe you're using like an sdx router or like an epx or some something where you don't have that cellular modem built in um enhanced security uh this actually has been request a long time by a couple of our Enterprise customers they released it uh in a special build in 8 . 4.1 and it's really nice to see that this is a 8.5 release we now have 802.1x on our wired land ports of most a lot of our routers um so uh smaller routers so we've added this support to the br2 br1 mini br1 mini 5G cor MTM um we did already have this in 8.4.1 on the mbx um and sdx I believe and so basically we now have 802.1x radius security so this is Port based security it already worked on our switches it's been there for a long time we've now added it to the switch ports on routers that support this um basically have um managed land port capability um and so it's a great feature Edition for the the highly security oh got hiccup sorry the highly secure conscious um basically what this does is you can click on an ethernet port enable Port based security and you'll see that authentication method so when you click on an ethernet port you now have authentication method so you add a radius server under radius servers here on the left-hand side so under Advanced miscellaneous edus radius server .1x authentication you'll set it up then when you click on go to your network port settings you click on a port and you're going to have the ability to do port-based authentication or security um this is a big deal for Enterprise clients Healthcare customers that are basically deploying these out in the field and need to make sure they have guaranteed who's ever plugging into this network is secure and has access to the network um uh if you want to play around with this you can actually spin up a Docker image with a free radius and tap it into that or spin up a free radius server um ISO uh like a virtual machine somewhere and then and then play around with a free radius and authenticate against the radius server but it's a great way to make sure that you know every single device that's plugging into your network and this pairs perfectly with WPA Enterprise radius authentication so now you have that same radius server can secure your Wi-Fi which we've had for for a long long time now supports secures your ethernet points um so you have uh four different mechanisms here uh forced authorization the port is set to authorize State allowing uh network access uh so basically you're forcing authorized um so this is if you need to bypass it for like a printer or something else uh Port based 021 X um single Au 2.1x this method is Port based but authenticates only one connected device per Port um port-based uh allows you to do basically it authorizes the port and then single off Mac based um this is a method uh authenticates a single device based on its Mac address the same username uh same username and password are both the MAC address uh in lowercase format without any deter um delimiters U and basically allows you to restrict it by a MAC address and username and password it's really cool added feature for the uh secure conscious there and you'll see that when you plug in your PC to the network um it's going to you're gonna have to enable 802.1 802.1x authentication and once you do that on that connection it will then prompt you for username password and you can see here um oh this is a new feature sorry enhanced data reports for SFP this is an Enterprise request basically letting us know what type of SFP has been plugged into a peplink router that supports sfps um so this is actually a CLI feature I was told this will be coming to guy later um but basically you can now see wam 3 sfp1 and we can actually get the details of that so you're G to get the uh the identifier that it's connected so did a lot of times um when you're doing Enterprise authenticate or Enterprise networks um that you want to see vendors and what's being connected to um your ports and so we've added the ability to actually read the transceivers that are plugged into your SFP this is a if this is a confusing to you don't worry about it it's not for you uh if if you are an Enterprise customer that plays around with uh sfps and 10 gigabit uh you you'll you'll know exactly what we're talking about and this is a greatly requested feature for troubleshooting um Enterprise networks with multiple a lot of transceivers and different kinds of transceivers on the network enhanced DHCP control we've added dhp range reservations um this is also been a heavily Enterprise uh requested feature which basically lets you do range exclusions um on your dhp server so say you have a dhp server and it's going to do um you you have uh 192168 5010 to 250 but then you need to exclude range UH 60 to 70 and and 100 to 150 you can now do that right here so you can have a a bigger scope range and then exclude smaller ranges what we used to do in the past for this prior to 8.5 is put in a whole bunch of fake Mac addresses and exclude those IPS manually uh this saves everybody in the Enterprise space or business space that needs to exclude ranges of ips this is a huge timesaver uh for for us uh in the DHCP world enhanced bgp route control once again another Enterprise feature um so uh I'd say 99.999% of our customers aren't playing around with bgp um however those of you that are um one of the things that we wanted to do was custom route advertising um 0.0.0 in other words the default gateway um it's say basically the default traffic routes through me um and then so in a bgp world if you can advertise out you're saying hey on the Gateway and you have another dhp another router that can also take the status of that Gateway so you can have two routers advertising default path um and so in bgp we want to be able to do that um it was missing from uh our previous firmware builds and we've added it to 8.5 um this comes with a very special request from um some of our uh one of our Enterprise sport sporting events uh and uh we had a special build and pushed it out to 8.5 firmware for them um manage all of your Docker straight from in control this has been requested ever since we announced Docker I think the day we announced Docker people kept saying hey when can we get this in in control and we're like yeah soon soon soon um so it's very proud to announce that if you are using peplink for Edge compute and Docker we can now manage Docker um via script files right inside side in control um and so uh basically if we go to in control settings um Docker management right here on your group settings you can now create scripts push that out and you can see which routers have received that script and um and handle the docker management right here um and so if if you need help with that um you know uh uh I would definitely reach out to someone that's familiar with Docker for this this capability we um but it is uh definitely super nice to see that we can now centrally manage pushing of Docker so imagine previously if you had a Docker image for an edge um solution even like say you want to do a DNS over SSL or encrypted DNS um you'd have to log into every single one of your br2s and push this out now you can literally just create a script that says hey here's my Docker image here's my settings for it push it to all my br2s and now you can push this to you know thousands of devices in a matter of seconds so great great little feature there I will add uh that will consume bandwidth if you're downloading a a 2 gigabyte Ubuntu base image and you push that out to 2,000 routers you know that's that's a lot of data you just Ed on a on your data plan so do pay attention to uh how you're pushing Docker out on scripts because I I was playing around with Docker with uh a a friend at at an RV park we were Building images and we we sucked up like a hundred plus gigabytes of data in a matter of like an hour and a half um and so I was like uh so I got I got an alert from my AT&T and alert from starlink saying hey by the way you're you you're out of data so um be careful Docker images you know just because the small little kbit uh script file does not mean the image that it's downloading is is kbits um and you will you will suck up data faster than you can imagine uh if you're if you're pushing out multiple scripts to a whole bunch of devices and you can see here um you know you can upload scripts then apply those scripts and you can see right there select a script so so once you upload a script you can then apply those scripts to these routers and then you'll see in the um the event log that the it ran the script uh accordingly you can see the docker Docker logs right there um another option is to add enable uh enable or disable Bluetooth in the B1 B1 plus 5G so in the B1 series routers um you can now enable and disable Bluetooth um so that's a a nice new feature uh that they've added uh for security conscious once again if you want to turn off that Bluetooth access um multiple IP pass through this has been this has been asked ever since we started multiple cellular routers I I I cannot believe this took as long as it took but it's really NE neat to see that it's now available I mean I I I mean I remember like the first hd4 and people go hey can I have multiple pass through and it was like oh no you need the br1 by buy four v1s um that is no longer the case now you could do VLAN based multiple IP uh pass through so basically you create you know two VLS select IP pass through and you'll be able to put cellular one to VLAN one cellular 2 to VLAN 2 and the first DHCP device on that VLAN will get that pass through IP address um so it's a great way um to to do that and um I'm very happy that peplink has added this uh to 8.5 um if you use IP pass through for your firewall or for your networks um this is really good if you're putting a peping router in front of another firewall especially one that supports a multiple interfaces you can literally have two interfaces plug those two interfaces into the pep link the br1 or 2 have the VR2 t v VLAN one and VL VLAN 3 and then basically pass through that down and now your firewall that doesn't have cellular capability has dual 5G motives um so another new a new feature that was added kind of going to that GPS receiver that we talked about earlier um now if your device doesn't have GPS and you're utilizing starling's GPS data to supplement your your data on ic2 um this will be automatic there's no there's no um uh necessary features so basically if you have starlink plugged into a Wan there's no GPS on the synergized device that then gets pushed over and now you have um so uh GPS capabilities on your router um and so you'll be able to pull in GPS from um uh starlinks GPS data to supplement your data on ic2 so it's sort of an automatic feature it's used if there is no GPS and it needs it um I have not been able to play with this because everything I have is uh has GPS I br2s and br1 pro 5gs and mxs um so if you have used this or or know about this I'd love to hear about that other new features and improvements um Docker support for log driver and log opt options once again if you're a developer and you're using Edge we've added those log driver and log option uh features for you Wi-Fi Wan now supports 802.11k and 802.11v standards this is better roaming connectivity between APS and also supports K has that VLAN capability so it's going to give you better uh better support for roaming and VLAN support as a Wan um uh T-Mobile in the US T-Mobile and Verizon eims can now be activated without a matching ID this simplifies the eim uh deployment process so far it's still not great when you're working with vendors uh uh with uh the the three big carriers for for eims but it's getting better um so I'm not going to answer a whole bunch of questions on eims on this video this is more about features um but we have had good success pushing out esms on specific plans and I think the plan matters um uh when you're talking about esms on the routers and now you can activate manage eims through Synergy mode so if you have Synergy mode uh uh SIM cards or modems like a sdx with an HD1 Dome you can now manage u e Sims through the Synergy mode uh controller um so we've added that as well the the biggest thing is look at that data sheet that data sheet has a whole plethora of improvements and fixes and patches and and new features to to help make sure that you're running um a stable and reliable Network um and once again please wait until we General availability if you're running this if you only have one peplink and it's in your production environment don't go in tonight and push 8.5 because you see a a feature there that you want to play with wait until it's GA or uh you know reach out to your local partner reseller and pick up a you know little B1 right I mean you pick up a B1 use it in your lab use it for testing these features and capabilities uh we will open the remainder time for Q&A so I'm just gonna scan through real fast and just start answering questions um top to bottom if that's okay with everybody um so any failover based on latency um we we don't have failover based on latency that's what dynamic weighted bonding is trying to do is basically mitigate latency um but we don't because latency is based on destination so you don't want to fail a Land Based on one destination because you might have great latency I mean that's where bgp and these Technologies try to mitigate that but the idea is that you don't want to fail over because your latency to to a European web server is slow if you're in the US um and and the latency to to somewhere else is good um but but if you're using speed Fusion you can mitigate latency using uh Wan smoothing and things like that um I know I about uh PP um uh we we did talk about this we I was uh we don't supporty support um ppsk on our ssids right now um it's currently we're we've created as a client we now support it um but it's not on our APS yet um Chris asked a really good question about Cellular Connections you know um cell your connections are definitely variable um you know I consider those what we call an A or what I call an Access Network basically you're paying for the right to use their Network and you know you could get 600 700 800 megabits or you get three megabits or none um and so they are Dynamic which is why least used has been challenging on Dynamic protocols in the past fast um so we're trying to always combat that um and just doing the best we can to adjust dynamically Dynamic weighted bonding has has taken great strides and adapting to um variability of cellular throughput we've even offered the ability to add cellular bandwidth capabilities so I think 8.3 um offered the ability now you can add cellular bandwidth um throughput to the Circuit to improve the calculation process and so I will say that it is if you know if you know in your area you're getting you know between 30 and 80 megabits per second of cellular download throughput put at 80 there it's not going to throttle you it's just telling the router hey this is sort of what I'm expecting to see um you know but if you're in downtown San Francisco and you're getting 850 megabits per second I mean good for you most people in rural areas are seeing you know you know 50 to you know 250 megabits per second and so you could throw that in there if you know what you're getting and so we've added that bandwidth capability in 8.3 um to help identify or help maximize um calculations um but Dynamic weighted bonding has done done great strides as well and once again bandwidth and throughput is is highly variable and so it could can go one way or the other and so we're just adapting the best we can um to that variabil variability Tom Travis I don't know if you have any further to say about that yeah I think that's you know kind of what the the update on the least used algorithm is trying to get at is doing a better job of estimating that in a Le you know in a lightly it's there's always this balance of like do we speed test the W or not right and no is basically the answer right that people want things to be based on speed all the time but we just don't know minute to minute second to Second and it's not efficient or helpful to speed test each cellular when over so that's I think what the update is trying to do is do a better job of estimating those realtime Cellular Connection bandwidths dynamically and as those sessions are established power coverage rate of redundancy um was asked how does that work basically um if you have two APS um and you do need at least two APS for it to do this but they basically are signaling each other and then um and then they're going to adjust their their power based on their overlap so they're basically the aps talk to each other and then adjust their power so they're not overlapping too much um and so if you only have one AP Power adj automatic power adjustment is not really going to make any difference because it has nothing to talk to um but if you have multiple APS it's a great way to prevent to the overlap of those signals too much um somebody asked why you need GPS what's it used for um a lot um GPS is used for Fleet management um First Responders government I we use it um all the time for uh for our tracking it's also used great for reports if you haven't seen some of the amazing reports that peplink uh pulls based on based on GPS so if I go to my router this is um just a really deep use of a few few minutes of time so I've got my fleet right here this is my speed Fusion Fleet um we've got we got I got my backpack Blake has his backpack we have our vehicles um so I'm in a in a car right now so I've got my backpack and my start L mini so there it is I can click on my backpack and there's my starlink and my T-Mobile and my AT&T I can go to report and I go to WAN quality reports and here I can pull up my ws and so there's my T-Mobile My Verizon AT&T and my Wan one so I can pull up T-Mobile I can pull up all and I can actually see a heat map of me driving this morning so I I woke up wherever this is this morning and I drove up to where I am right now and you can see my path this is the GPS providing this detail and then I get a heat map of T-Mobile as I was driving up the the the interstate there the back roads I can swap over to to Verizon AT&T and I could see Verizon AT&T and and see their map and you can see that's actually worse than the T-Mobile one and then I can pull up W one which is connected to my star link now it's not going to give me signal but it's going to get me my ups and downs so how stable was starlink throughout this trip and then here you can you can see all my ups and downs as I was going under bridges and things like that and so here's my driving this morning using GPS tracking my Starling connection here's my latency here's my ups and downs as I was traveling around and I will in Star Link's defense that is my starlink I don't know if you can see it or not but it's just in my window um and it's a starlink mini um so it's not you know it's not it's not mounted to the roof and it's not a you know um so that's it's just getting very limited throughput or limited visibility to the sky and then if I pull up my T-Mobile again you can see how many times it disconnected as well and so using GPS just for my own information I'm able to see uh disconnects drops of the of the circuit um I'm able to see um my latency and I'm able to see the throughput and quality um so it's a great way to troubleshoot the the capabilities of of a network where you're at on top of that if I go back to my device details GPS provides me realtime analytics on what I'm doing so I can pull up this L this map and this is I mean this is me right now I'm sitting in a parking lot right there being safe obviously doing my meeting um and so GPS provides amazing uh capabilities to see what you're doing where your Fleet is um what's happening in the network um and so you could see there's my there's my drive today and where I went and I'm able to to see that right right there um so so really really nice um features and capabilities whether you're using it for your personal use just to see how good your internet has been or if you're using it as an IT person to troubleshoot your Fleet um I use it for that purpose I use it to troubleshoot my fleet all the time um and so it's it's a great uh great capability there um uh for for netflow Server the um I I I I don't want to to to recommend a specific uh solution but I do have a video called adaptive responsive on my YouTube channel um and someone asked if I have a recommendation for a netflow server and there's a company out there that that does some pretty cool stuff with net flow but basically any s is gonna be able to take netf flow data and parse it in a way that generates reports for you um uh but but on the YouTube channel I I don't want to I don't want to specifically endorse a specific one if that if that's okay um but there are there are lots of really cool features and capabilities out there um for for net flow and so if we did not answer your questions um it's not that we didn't want to uh it's that we either didn't have enough time or maybe it was out of scope uh or troubleshooting which we want to avoid troubleshooting because we're right now we're talking about features um please feel free to email us uh Travis pink.com or uh peterw pink.com um and so you could email uh peterw pink.com or Travis at pink.com and we more than happy to um uh answer any additional questions or get you right get you in contact with the right partner um or resource to answer those questions for you and um thank thank you so much for your time today and I hope these features uh you find valuable and if you have any feedback uh please email email us or um let us know and if you have any recommendations something you'd like to learn about there's a particular feature you'd like us to to have um on on the the series uh please send us that feedback and we'll create the we we'll review that for the next video thank you folks thank you Peter as always have a good one all right take care folks"}

Travis Durk product manager at peplink today Peter retail retail today we're gonna talk about retail and hits a little close to home for me because I do I do own my little uh ice cream stores and so you know I use peplink in my retail locations and and so it's a lot of fun but um we kind of created a little fun little uh commercial a year or so ago about like Bob's ice cream store needing the 20x for for retail connectivity and when we decided what are we going to do for July and I was like well let's do a let's we're going to do these vertical Series right uh you talking about how peplink Works in specific verticals and this one being on retail uh connectivity um really hits close to home is like I said for for my re for my ice cream store but also for several of our really high-end customers that are adopting peplink for branch and Retail operations and and I don't think they're getting enough uh visibility and so I thought it'd be a fun webinar just to talk about how awesome peplink can be for various connectivity requirements um in the retail field yeah and I think retail is one of those markets that peplink really had early successes in because we've got such a scalable solution and so this is a yeah this is a great webinar to kind of refresh and show people why why that was an early success for peplink and what it can do for anybody in the retail field but in not only the hardware platform or I guess uh scalability but also price point I mean we have some of the best price points on these low-end Cat 4 and Cat 7 routers so it creates an incredible value proposition for retail um users yeah absolutely yep it adds up quick when you got a lot of locations for sure yeah right some of the challenges that that I think retail people experience is centralized Network management like an easy way to see your locations get alerts on the status and health of their connections like are my winds up and down am I running on 5G or you know what is the status um yeah I've been I've been into a lot of different retail places you know chain restaurants those kind pizza places and then like you look at the technology in there and there's five different vendors most of the time right and it's like Central management that's that's what we're talking about right you've got all these different systems camera systems phones and your router too so and body is is agnostic they they you know all these vendors it's like NCR will come in and um NCR will come in and just hey I'm gonna put in my firewall with my system it's my PCI compliance my settings and it doesn't matter what else is going on guest Wi-Fi or security systems or fire systems or anything else that might might be necessary and um and so having visibility and the you know to the network is is crucial I think especially if you're managing lots of locations the um I think it's really important and you know the ability to centrally manage firewall settings wireless settings things like that um is is lacking in the branch in retail space um heavily um the other thing is uh reliable Wireless connectivity having reliable Wireless networking that's easy to manage and easy to scale um you know a lot of times they'll go to Best Buy and buy just whatever off the shelf Wi-Fi product and plug it into their Network because they really don't know they don't really have cost or budget for either high-end products or they just don't know uh you know what do I plug into this network and so I so a lot of times once you get this HJ pod of vendors it's like oh I needed a guest Wi-Fi so I you know ran to Best Buy and just grabbed whatever product was on the Shelf at the time and now you have this unsecure unmanaged just Wi-Fi device just basically plugged into your landan um I mean one time I was showing a customer I was sitting up in North Carolina at a coffee shop and I was like hey look I'm browsing your QuickBook Server Like You plugged a this little linky Wi-Fi device Wan into your network well the Lan of that network is your point of sale and you basically are giving everybody access to your servers um without even thinking about how that's being secured um and Sor down their PCI compliance right yeah it's like oh we just plugged in a Wi-Fi network into our secure network so that's now gone um and and so you know it it's it's important to to know to be able to see that and then also be able to to give those guest Wi-Fi networks or you know staff Wii you know access to the to the network um and then the two that I added that is H transaction stability and and I did say Point of Sales stability originally but transaction stability in other words whatever your critical application is that you're running for your retail could be access to your your your parts uh platform it could be access to point of sale credit card processing Etc but the idea is we need to make sure that those transactions don't get interrupted if you're running an ATM you want to make sure that when they put in that credit card if the internet messes up that credit card still goes through you don't get a failed transaction then the customer gets afraid oh my GNA get double transaction or am I gonna have a single transaction you go oh let me let me watch this for you right and so transaction stability is actually incredibly important for for retail and Branch because it creates customer stability the customer is happy knowing that transaction occurred um without going oh do I need to watch my credit card statement for the next couple days to see if I got double charged um from from the loc you know from the business owner side too like okay you just look at a lunch rush in a restaurant right like if the line's too long people leave it doesn't matter what the reason right they just kind of like get impatient and either just turn around right away or they leave shortly after but you know if you start failing transactions that line doesn't move and more and more people leave right like a simple failover can cause you know a couple minute delay for transactions well a couple minutes in a lunch line yeah you're going to lose tons of customers at that point yeah and then the the the final one is build out cost and delays um and this actually will come to a really fun little case study we'll talk about um but it the idea is that um if you're building out you know an entire chain of of locations you know 200 300 400 500 locations the cost to build out those sites is insane these days U you're talking in the the the double digit tens of thousands of dollars to to build out internet and then you're going to pay a ridiculous amount of money per month to offset the buildout but you paid for the buildout so you're in a contract for a buildout that you paid for um and then usually you have construction meetings buildout meetings then you have delay Associated to whatever easements and things like that that have to come up and so the construction costs go up for your new sites because you can't get the internet there on time and so the the contractors are upset the the the delay the the general manager the retail managers are are upset because they can't launch their store and you're sitting there waiting for internet even though you ordered it six months in advance um yeah build up cost or not just the time alone right I mean like you said you're ready to go but your intern is not there what do you do right even if you're not paying for that build out like you're paying for all the other stuff that's waiting and yeah and so it and and that that's a a a pet peeve that I never even really thought about until this this case study we're going to talk about but you know it was you know it's it's an insane amount of uh overhead just on the internet side that's not me everything else electrical and construction and all the other parts and then you're sitting there waiting the longest for what be the simplest right internet's a commodity these days and the fact that it it's the most annoying piece of that puzzle is just a a kind of a shame for for for the buildout process and and for our for it in a s in yeah and that's why we're seeing fixed Wireless and 5G really take yeah that's talk more about that here yeah zero day connectivity and so so we talk about how how does peplink help with those things so the first is we can increase visibility and PCI compliance right when you when you have a fixed ecosystem and you I shouldn't say fixed a unified ecosystem where you have your your modem and your router and your firewall and it's all managed in control and you have hundreds of sites now we have full visibility into those sites we have centralized firewall policy centralized PCI compliance right I can set my username and my passwords I can set my VLAN for my for my point of sales system I can make sure that that VLAN that point of sales system has the same firewall policy across 500 locations I can make sure that we're standardizing the security and the compliance we also can see it and that is amazing when you're talking about multilocation branches um and that's really the power of end control and the and then the ecosystem that you get with peplink because you can have a guest VLAN you could have a staff VLAN you could have your PCI your point of sale VLAN and then you could have different firewall policies that apply to those subnets those networks all within the peplink router so you can say hey that PCI that point of sale secure network it can't talk to anything except for the point of sale servers on the internet there's no access inbound or outbound my guest Network hey you know block maybe a couple sensitive categories um make sure it can't talk to anything else make sure it's not behind my my point of sale Network it's it's beside it and then let it have a piece of the puzzle let it have a piece of the broadband internet um so that it can it can that users can use that Wi-Fi but only the like Broadband Wi-Fi or broadband internet and then you have your staff Network that maybe is a little bit more restricted but but they get access to 5G failover and things like that so they stay connected um regardless of the status of your Broadband circuits um and so they can have different firewall policies but then you go man that's a lot to manage no it's only one little tiny checkbox that then you manage 500 sites or a thousand sites or 10,000 sites and that's the benefit is that within control and centralized management it's a single pane of glass it's one simple checkbox yeah to build it once experience right a lot of other vendors you're building it 500 times over for 500 locations you're copying a config y you're you know you're copying a config you're you're you're you load you have a template to config that you're loading and that is not convenient at all um the it's it's a it's kind of a nightmare to manage um across sites absolutely yeah and I think maybe we'll get into this a little bit more but you know there are other vendors that have Central management and have some of those Solutions as well but I think when you actually deploy them at scale you start to really run into the pitfalls and where you really don't have that single pain or build it once experience even yeah even then um it's it's like a PL it's a platform right but it's not centrally managed it's centrally it's almost like a like a central portal but distributed management like um and there are some features that are centrally available um you know but but when you look at one the total cost of it um versus Prime Care and essential like you know especially Prime Care pricing on our on our small routers the total cost of ownership the subscription requirement and then the the ability to centrally manage firewall policies outbound policies traffic shaping um your speed Fusion VPN configurations I I did a a project for a customer that's going full 5G um Broadband replacement so no broadband uh repl uh connections at all and they wanted to set up bonding to an epx and a data center and they're like well how what's the downtime what's the configuration I go I'm done and they go wait what do you mean you're done I said it's done I just did all 190 sites and they're all being bonded now and literally I just went speed Fusion configure new select all next bonded the epx next send all traffic next done and now they were bonded and so in the time that it took him to explain how worried he was on the the amount of time needed to configure all these sites I had already done it and and he's like wait a second what yeah it's it's all done and he he was at one of the sites because I didn't even notice it change I said yeah but try that website that wasn't working and he tried it I was like now it's working right he goes yes because now you have a now you're in a data center with a public IP address and so you're not being seen as a VPN or a connection um and so we were able to to streamline his operations and clean it up and and it took seconds like literally seconds and um and they they were blown away by that capability and that goes up into to how can peping help number two is quick and E convenient deployments at any location with peplink and the ecosystem and that unified Hardware you and and they kind of have this scale down below you can onboard any size location in seconds and that is something that is unheard of in my opinion for for almost anybody that's ever dealt with our with the with mobility and construction costs you can have something as little as a br1 mini to light up a quick internet connection all the way to a corporate infrastructure that's running tens of thousands of users and literally that you can have them up and running in seconds with integrated 5G integrated fixed Wireless capabilities and then on board or light up the internet for their um for their fiber uh I was doing a project this weekend in San Francisco the fiber wasn't ready well I just took a starlink threw it in plugged it into the sdx router that they were there the ha SD X routers um I trunk that VLAN into their core switch literally plugged that the starlink into the core switch then I just did the the VLAN is wan feature and the ha pair of Pep links down to their switch stack just said hey VLAN 31 is my my starlink and boom this the the sdx that's came online didn't waste an internet port no ethernet ports wasted on it and then as soon as the carrier came in they plugged in their Internet to the fiber ports on the sdx I said okay what's the IP address L it up brought it online and then I had the starlink and the um the new the new gig fiber line online and working and but there was I was able to do it yesterday while I was doing you know while I was down here back in Florida already and so the ability to zero touch these devices U bring them online instantaneously with almost any possible internet uh really speeds up deployment and simplifies that access yeah and I think one thing that people don't really realize you know when you deploy these things everybody's kind of just looking at it as the day one or day Zero perspective but you know if you're a large chain and you've got 500 locations you're going to make changes right there's going to be a new model that comes out there's going to be this or that that changes Hardware wise maybe right you're going to have this for many many years so you start out with like a hundred of this model and maybe it's really easy with another vendor to push Wi-Fi or push vlans in that case but then yeah you start adding models and a lot of these other clouds don't let you manage multiple models or manage an access point in a router the same way so that you can have a consistent SSID there's there's just a lot of pitfalls that play out over the total total life cycle of these deployments and that's again where people really feel that that that benefit with peplink and that they they don't lose that ease of management as as the deployment grows and evolves yeah exactly uh and so um so so you can have and what's nice is once again you could have like if you know you're going to have Broadband circuits or or Internet you can have like a single cellular fi uh device like the the B1 the br1 the 310 5G Etc um and have 5G failover or you can do like full Broadband replacement with our dual cellular devices like the br2 and the br2 pro and the you know Transit Duo um and then you can have like full infrastructure reliability with like the mbx and the sdx and the epx and so same ecosystem same zero touch configuration same firewall policies um but without the ne with like but but scalable based on the size of the location you're at uh Tom asked he talked about our firewall policies he says are there any enhancements we're missing quite a few corporate features including things such as IPS and IDs application awareness um first uh of all Tom peplink has had IPS and IDs for quite some time now uh not and now we have application aware content blocking we can block like Tik Tok and Facebook and different applications there's I don't know if you know the exact number Travis but every firmware they keep adding more applications so we're DPI aware layer 7 aware application aware content filtering for like uh you know pornography and malware and adaware um as as well as inbound outbound and net flow so you know I have an entire fire yeah several hundred it's something that we get scored on for like the you know when we get ranked on these quadrants and things those are things that there's Baseline requirements to even be on those and so we've got several hundred applications in those signatures for firewalls for routing policies yeah and and we do have a webinar uh the peplink university on firewall we actually that was one of the ones we did was kind of fun where we go over some of these firewall features because people think of us just as an sdw or a Wan aggregator but we have actually a pretty robust firewall and I'm actually today sitting in a site where we are replacing several firewall and core switches with peplink 2500 ECS that's actually where I'm at today doing this install and um and so you know it Pink's firewall capabilities have really stepped up their game uh there I mean obviously there's always things you would like to see improved I think you could say that about any vendor um but yeah our firewall capabilities we we meet or exceed n standards for cryptography uh we we're PCI Compliant we're fips compliant from uh uh at least coming with the new chip CH coming here soon so there's a lot of options for capabilities around the um around that someone asked about where to find the previous peplink University you can either go to um YouTube youtube.com peplink and uh there's a webinars tab uh peplink University or you can go to it's coming soon I I believe it's going to be launched here in just a few days but we also are consolidating everything to peplink university.com so peplink university.com will have a list of all of the peplink webinars um or you can go to youtube.com peplink and then go to the playlist and then you'll find the peplink university uh series there um and so the that's where you can find all those videos but we you know we try to talk about all these different Technologies and have them out there and ready and available for you like outbound policies firewall policies and things like that okay so let's move on oh goad I'll throw a link up to the current playlist yeah perfect and then and then peplink brings enhanced customer experiences like Wi-Fi in store Wi-Fi hotspots with custom branding and captive portals so you can have um with peplink built into the ecosystem we have captive portals for guest Wi-Fi we have multiple ssids most of our routers support 16 ssids um some of them support four ssids but either way they support more than one um and so you can have staff Wi-Fi you can have a guest Wi-Fi you can have your logo and it redirect uh appropriately through um through to your website and so you can have you know hey here's our guest Network they hit continue or accept the agreement of terms of use and then it redirect to your menu or your landing page or your social media like hey Rus on Google um Etc and so you can redirect them to a landing page of your your choice all built right into the peplink ecosystem so it allows you to to quickly gather insights into users of Wi-Fi users but also have like the ability to have that capture portal with time and bandwidth requirements and visibility to who your users are yeah and I think you know captive portal and guest Wi-Fi isn't the most important thing for a retail shop but it is really important I mean and and it's it's a complication that isn't necessarily directly driving money to them and so it's something that businesses don't want to spend a lot of money on but again people want it people need it it's part of that customer experience that people expect and so again this is a platform this isn't just a router right this is a platform that you can add these different things in you can have these capabilities and features and you don't have to keep spending money to get those things you bought a peping router for your failover you already have the captive portal solution built in you just need to set it up or or have Peter come set it up for you but yeah it's a platform right it's not a router exactly um and and so and like I like I mentioned kind of already but we have scalable router Eco system for for almost any type of deployment whether it's an ATM or a large corporate office um and so you're going to be able to have the same unified ecosystem and feel across all platform all Sites which I find to be very useful yeah I think that's interesting too like if we look at that model lineup there and we try to do all those locations with a traditional Enterprise sdan vendor how much money are you going to spend a month on that ATM site if you're using um you know one of those big names out there in the Enterprise you if you look at that magic quadrant the people at the very very top on there how much money will that cost you a month to have a th000 ATMs with true sdan failover so curious Travis how much is it monthly for peplink there is no monthly cost right I mean you keep your in control warranty you know you just keep that care even even if not I mean our peling products are Perpetual you just lose in control true I meaned Fusion feature even exactly expired so yeah that's an excellent point yeah I mean so in control being a really nice Cloud platform is awesome but the the reality is is that one of the coolest things about peplink especially when you're talking about someone that's budget budget conscious you don't need our cloud and all of our Equipment Works perpetually and so if you are the kind of person that goes hey I don't like the cloud I I don't want those features I just want to have a reliable failover and um and ecosystem you can manage manage all of these devices yourself and there's an open API so if you're incredibly creative you can write your own inol cloud and literally log into these routers and have your own private solution um and so there's a publicly documented API that all these routers work on completely free so you know we've have customers I've had customers write their own scripting capabilities that onboard devices um with with even further zero touch based on their protocol uh and so that's what's kind of neat about the ecosystem is it's not locked down you own the environment uh which is very rare in today's world most companies own you uh and they own your infrastructure we peplink you own it you own the the network you own the infrastructure we just help you get it connected uh and and so we're going to do that within control and and zero touch configuration capabilities but but you own it and I and I think that's really neat especally in today's world where if you don't renew your warranty your whole network gets shut down with some vendors um yeah yeah I mean sometimes I'll name names but I'm naming them here because this is just I think it's so egregious and it's so crazy to me this is how it works if you buy Mori and put that in your 500 locations and you stop paying them what happens your networks go down that's insane they've hijacked you are now you must pay to continue like yeah you spend thousands of dollars on services and equipment and then if you don't renew the warranty or you're having a bad month or whatever it might be you're done you're down um nine times out of 10 people just forgot right and then holy crap my whole business went down because I just forgot to renew a like that's insane right that's just yeah people like people need to realize that right you're putting yourself at huge risk if you if you choose one of those Solutions it's just a practical reality of other vendor solutions that they don't really they don't want to talk about that of course but yeah and so then we can talk about how peplink helps um in these retail branch locations like ATMs and remote outposts um what's nice about peping speed Fusion technology is the ability to aggregate W so we can create what's called a hot failover uh hot failover and bonding allow you to aggregate multiple internet connections together to create a seamless reliable session persistent transaction which means ATMs if you have a a small little you know DSL or Broadband modem powering it and then a failover 4G or 5G connection if you're in the middle of a transaction and you're using a peplink router with speed Fusion the broadband connection is your primary the 5G 4G is your backup however in the middle of the transaction with speed Fusion that actually never gets interrupted so if somebody's in the middle of a transaction and the Broadband goes goes down the 4G and 5G seamlessly picks up the transaction and continues the operation because of speed Fusion technology this is incredibly valuable once we talk about that transaction stability right that enduser that customer experience um they feel more safe they feel confident that their transactions are going through and as a as a business you don't have to worry about oh check that transaction make sure it's okay right because I know that no matter what whether it's Broadband or 4G 5G I'm going to be connected and those transactions are going to happen with stability and confidence um and we have really incredibly lowcost solutions for those I those Cat 4 C uh Cat 4 and Cat 7 br1 minis are incredibly cost-effective designed for this scenario where they're ruggedized and you can put them right inside the ATM machines or your you know uh kiosks to be able to process transactions yeah I this peplink really combines two things that I don't I talk about a little bit but you know there's there's Enterprise players in the market and then there's like these really lowc cost vendors in the market right just the cheap throwaway type devices and so peping spans both of those and we've got these devices that reach those lower price points but you get all those same Enterprise features right if you buy that cheap throwaway product you don't get that hot failover you don't get any of those things you just bought a thing that's going to only do that exact thing that day you bought it and it might not even get a firm ware update after that but well usually because of the lack of central management you don't even know if it needs a firmware update or know how to or you're afraid to push the firmware updates um and then what happens is that Broadband fails you lose the transactions you have to wait for the 4G 5G to establish connect and then fail over and reestablish an ipvpn or whatever connection is to your to your services and then it and then it starts working so you can be down 30 to 90 seconds for that IP tunnel to reestablish and and that's you know that means customers are waiting and can't do transactions yeah and you know you wait that 30 to 90 seconds for the failover to happen you might have to reboot the the POS terminal then too to get it back up and like there's just all this Fallout that happens for automatic failover right yep it's just not the same as Pink's experience so then we G to talk about like popup in Mobile experiences popup locations popup retail stores popup environments are are are happening all over the the country right now or world I should say they're really popular these popup stores where you're trying to have quick and access to a to either you know a retail location maybe at an event like the you know Super Bowl or something like that or you're just testing your environment you're spinning up a quick popup location to test your product at a at a location and um and the ability to have seamless connectivity while doing that be able to spin up these pop-up stores quickly is incredibly important and that's where peplink has our multi-cellular routers for this purpose so we talked about ATM and remote Outpost with a single cellular failover solution then we talk about pop-up mobile experiences where we're talking about dual 4G and dual 5G so if you're talking about just point of sale just critical application you could do like a dual 4G solution where you only need a couple megabits of internet but you need it to be incredibly reliable and that's critical right there I need to work regardless of AT&T T-Mobile Verizon I need to make sure that those transactions to ur and and I might have tens or even hundreds of these little tiny microtransactions occurring and I need them to be stable so when with bonding with speed Fusion bonding we can aggregate M multiple SIM cards together to create a really robust network connection instantaneously so these zero day you know people will say zero day or um so without any buildup buildout time without any needing to order a broadband connection a popup these popup experiences can put a put a br2 or a Transit duo or you know a B1 with a Max adapter you know b15g with a Max adapter throw one of these dual 5G or 4G Solutions out there um and have these transactions instantaneously available um for these pop-up stores and but we've been doing a lot of this with um one of the major carriers right now for their pop-up retail locations helping them streamline deployments and um it's been a lot of fun you do all that and you still maintain PCI compliance you still have that easy ability right it's no different than a brick and mortar store from a work to the administrator right it's all the same we we had a a customer um reach out to us a couple years ago uh probably a year and a half ago now for the for the they were trying to spin up a retail location for in time to Launch the Super Bowl in Phoenix Arizona the ISP the Broadband provider was not able to um get the circuit in and even if they could it was $56,000 to bring in that circuit to the to the location the retail location and the CIO just was like no like holy cow no there has to be a better solution he found peplink found us within 48 hours I had a br2 pro overnighted to him with a with two 5G modems T-Mobile and AT&T they had their store up and running it took a couple minutes to set up the store and they were able to then launch in time for the Super Bowl and run seamlessly and flawlessly throughout the Super Bowl experience for them after that event they cancelled all of their Broadband contracts and bought br2s uh ubrs and br2s for all of their remaining stores that they were onboarding and it was game changer for them instead of having 6 months of bi-weekly carrier meetings to just plug in a Broadband circuit they literally just mail a modem or a router and an antenna to the location the construction crew plugs it in it turns it on and they have internet um and they are now running full Broadband replaced with bonded 4G and 5G Solutions it's incredibly valuable sorry incred powerful to be able to onboard a location with near zero setup experience and have construction workers and Retail and your employees functioning on day one right then and there um without having to have all those meetings um yeah it's it's been such an amazing testimonial to the power of Pep link I we can't and we can't get enough of it it's it's such a powerful testimonial to to to to how fixed Wireless is changing the game plan for for people and then we can talk about temporary and small offices or our small branches they might go you might go oh that's really neat for a little point of sale transaction but but we have an entire building we have a whole office that needs to power and um and that's why peplink has extended we have the sdx and the epx and we have these high powerered routers that can have two four or even 40 5G and 4G and starlink connections that you can light up to create basically any bandwidth requirement that you need um so just to be a little bit more realistic and for most people you take an sdx with two 5G modems you can plug this in and have bonded 5G as a Broadband replacement and or Broadband auxiliary like uh supplement for increased stability um built right into your ecosystem right one piece of Hardware that that Powers the entire infrastructure for even large uh facilities so once again this the same retailer they Central food processing their Central kitchens they now run sdx with HD2 LR domes on the roof of the buildings and so they have our High Gain long range high power 5G domes plugged right into the sxs that gives them full zero day connectivity so they're not waiting for the I mean they brought on their kitchen like three or four months ago the most recent one but because of the HD2 long range we literally had that mounted to the roof on the first day of construction plug that into the sdx and they were on lining up and running and they didn't have to think about or worry about the connectivity I think cool because you can carry a site from like the first shovel in the ground to yeah been up and running for five years on the same piece of equipment the same Hardware the same Sims everything right and just last week we plugged in the fiber it took that long to get connected just last week we finally got Spectrum fiber plugged in and they into that building and and it was like it took months it was months delayed the the the the the landlord never couldn't send an easement for uh for for boring they had to then trunk it into through a different MDF solution and and wire it through and it took months and they would have been down for months but instead they just were running on and now it's just failed over and now they have the the 5G modems as the as the backup and then the uh fiber is the primary yeah so I'm sure they're very confident their backup works great because they used it for that long right yep Chris asked an interesting question will we run out of radio bandwidth anytime soon you know that's an interesting qu question Chris but but more importantly if you notice like we first we started with like Evo and then like cellular you know 1X and then Evo and then you know went to LTE 4G like you know 3G and 4G and now 5G the companies are getting really good at low at at repurposing those old frequencies one of the biggest things that T-Mobile has done by buying Sprint was getting that old frequency they're buying that old those old uh slow frequencies and then repurposing them for 5G and 6G um so so yeah there is a limited frequency in a coverage area area but the carriers are incredibly good at maximizing those frequencies upgrading the radios to support more bandwidth and more capabilities um and so every every six months it's like a new iteration of of of optimization of those those channels and availability and there's a lot of frequency now available we're going all the way from 600 megahertz to just over 3700 megahertz of frequency that's readily available and and really the Spectrum goes all the way to six GHz now on the on what we call the sub6 frequency um which is so the it's not just one or two bands that are available I mean there's there's a lot of frequency bands available and that's only the like I said the sub six then we go into the millimeter wave and you're got you're talking like 31 me mega gigz all the way to I think 34 gigahertz of frequency range there um and so there's a lot of frequency available uh for playing around um and and these carriers are incredibly good at repurposing the old channels and and making them faster and better for modern with modern technology uh so I think you know there could be some bottleneck in the future but I think as technology improves the frequency availability just gets more Broad and I'm not an RF engineer um I'm I'm not skilled or qualified to speak much more than that it's just my experience in it yeah totally and I think I think that's a great answer I mean you know are when might you run out of radio bandwidth like maybe between 4: and 6:00 p.m. today at in certain locations right like overall like yes the they've got spectrum and they're repurposing it and millimeter wave kind of started and fizzled at first but you know we'll see another wave of that in a few more years once these other sub6 bands really do start getting saturated and in you know in a wider scale but um there's always more uses the more high quality sources of bandwidth the more applications that are possible out in the field and so that's you know we're here to utilize those and take advantage of those and you know that's that's a never ending game so adding more WS is always something you're going to need and being able to combine those as well so let's talk about the the routers that are Moder currently available um on the available to uh solve these different missions on specifically around the retail space I mean we talked about the the the girth and scale but let's let's go back to the the retail connectivity and the routers that are available right now um if you've heard about the 20x or the 20 those have been retired end of life we now have the B1 so you have the B1 plus uh the B1 plus is a 4G failover router so you can have your your broadband and then 4G failover incredible uh price point here for this router um so it's going to be you know almost the lowest cost peplink bonding failover router that that you can get Wi-Fi 6 connectivity um based on the B1 platform but just with a nice affordable 4G connection great for point of sale failover um the 4G is probably not going to power your guest Wi-Fi network but it's gonna it's going to give you uh the the throughput to make sure that your point of sale applications your CR business critical uh transactions occur and then we go to the b15g this is going to have your your ethernet for your Broadband but then a a single 5G modem this is going to be great for full business redundancy you know a lot of times your cable modems or your Broadband providers might only go out for a few minutes you know there Interruption of services reboots Etc you know the 5G is going to seamlessly kick in the transactions are going to seamlessly uh take over and you can probably most the time even carry your guest Wi-Fi transactions you know we only talking about a few minutes minutes guest Wi-Fi continues to operate and then the cable modem comes back online um so it's a great way to have that resiliency and extra bandwidth needed um to keep the entire business up and running during an outage of your broadband service then we go into what we call you know full Broadband replacement so these are going to be dual 4G and dual 5G routers designed to actually replace Broadband if you don't want to pay that bill or you want to have zero day capabilities uh so this is going to be the transit Duo um and the new brand new if you're if you're a partner on this webinar uh you should have gotten the announcement this morning the brand new br2 is going to be launching on July 11th for the public um so this is uh it looks very similar if you're if you're uh kind of a playing around in our our wheelhouse for a while to the ubr so the ubr is now being rebranded as the br2 um and so you're going to have this ubr br2 uh new device so it's important to understand the transit Duo is a dual 4G cat 7 and Cat 12 whereas the br2 which if you remember the old ubr dual Cat 4 this is designed for low bandwidth applications but dual carrier reliability um and so this is awesome for your for your sites that maybe need you know an incredibly reliable 10 to 15 megabits of throughput you're got you can get more by by all means I've seen it 40 50 60 even even 100 Megs of throughput but uh realistically uh you're going to be in that sub 20 Megs of of stab stable throughput and so you can have this dual Fort Cat 4 device really giving you capabilities to run your business without the need for Broadband um with either the the new br2 and the uh Transit Duos then if you're looking for full Broadband replacement So you you're looking to that get that 100 200 300 Megs of download throughput with a a stable upload throughput very similar to a cable modem you know that 100 by10 300 by 20 you know that's what you're going to get with the br2 you're going to get dual 5G capabilities you can Bond T-Mobile and AT&T or Verizon and then you're going to have that Stable download and stable upload with bonding so we can aggregate those together to create a incredibly reliable download and upload trans for for business Wi-Fi for guest Wi-Fi for your point of sell applications Etc and really fully replace the Broadband circuit um that's going to give you no build times no build cost and the only thing I'm going to add to this is the antenna matters um where you place your antenna and getting that antenna having a nice High Gain antenna and it's going to matter in some locations you could probably use the little black stick antennas and you'll be fine some antennas you could probably put a 42g or a 40G up there and you'll be fine some locations you might want to get that an outside if you're in a bad coverage area get that antenna outside to maximize reception for 4G and 5G and that's the only thing that you need to really pay attention to when you're doing a a full 4G or full full 5G uh type of deployment is making sure that the antenna location gives you the bandwidth that you need to accomplish the mission um so if you're only looking for 10 Megs of throughput and putting a 40G antenna inside the building gives you 15 20 Megs of throughput great leave it alone but if you're only getting three or four mags of through put inside put that int outside you know drill a hole in the side have your have your construction guys Mount that intent outside if you can't put it outside a really high gain inter internal antenna like the the maritime 40G it's gonna pretty much get your internet anywhere and everywhere you go um so don't be discouraged if you do a speed test and realize it's not getting the throughput you need um you know reach out to your peping partner or if you are a partner um you're going to be able to to to just make sure that you're looking at the the throughput and Signal Chris you just asked a question does peplink offer High Gain tance yes we do we have great antennas going all the way from little stick antennas all the way to high performance Maritime antennas that I actually call fixed Wireless antennas the the we've taken these Maritime 40G antennas and I've used them to provide over 500 Megs of download through put on areas where I was getting three megabits on my cell phone speed test um and so the maritime antennas are 30 36 Ines long and so they're going to have great reception and great transmit power which means when you're dealing with inside of a brick building or you're trying to get coverage in an area where maybe you can't penetrate The Bu the outside of the building um or you're in a really rural area and you want to maximize the ability to receive that signal you can take these Maritime antennas and screw them into the wall and you're going to get pretty much guaranteed a better signal and anybody have ever called me and said hey I'm having a problem we mail them at marath time hey plug this in and see if it works and they go okay how much does it cost and then they'll because the antenna because it it it works um but they're expensive so they work um but but if you don't need it then don't buy it um you know what what you want to do is just be aware that you might have to have good antennas on some comp complex uh and areas sometimes those the little black stick antennas are providing enough bandwidth done no reason to buy a 200 $400 or $600 antenna if a little black antenna gives you the bandwidth you need um but those few times the black antennas don't work that's when you just want to evaluate a better antenna and so have those in your construction guys toolkit that just says hey you know if if you're not getting the bandwidth you need check the antenna yeah and I think similar to the product line with the you know the hardware models we showed you know we've got a ladder of like smaller all the way up to the really big stuff and that same applies on the on the antenna side right yeah got this ladder of solutions for you to climb if if this isn't enough for this location hey we've got another rung that you can climb to and now we can hit that number right so you know when you find when you find peplink you've got the platform you've got the accessories you've got all of those things all paired together all designed together all designed in house right these aren't third party antennas we design every one of these antennas ourselves we figure out which products they're going to make the most sense with and we make sure that they're going to do that job and serve that mission the best I have a customer just this morning that's that's been a huge fan of the transit Duo Pro but he's doing a broadcast in an area that just that there's not enough bandwidth for the Dual the Dual 4G and so we mailed them a demo mbx 5G and like here try try this this will solve your problem because as much as you would love the the coverage to be perfect everywhere it's not I mean that's just the nature of the Beast and so we have to be aware that there's there's no one size fits-all unless you want to buy an epx for everywhere I mean that's so it's just being aware that some locations the coverage and the throughput aren't there and so we have to then figure out and get creative and solve that problem and you you solve that problem by throwing more at it right if I'm five users on the tower instead of two users on the tower I've got five times more opportunity for capacity um and so it it's we have to adapt to those scenarios while keeping it within the the restraints of a of a of a moderate budget yeah and if you're like doing a store within store type of deployment you know like you you talked about you you laid it out so well in terms of like if you're here and it's not working then move it over there if it's not working there then drill the hole and you know when you're doing some of these retail configurations you don't have all of those options every time right you know if you're a store within a store you don't get to drill right there just you're not allowed to you got to work inside of there and so maybe you use an antenna inste you know maybe you use a bigger antenna or maybe you switch from 4G to 5G so there's lots of different options to work around those problems for regardless of the scenario and how many different offshoot locations you have to deal with yep but the transit duo or the br2 solves 90% of your missions take that as a win and just be aware that the few the 10% that doesn't maybe we have to do a br2 pro instead you know get a little bit more throughput um and you saved yourself a bunch of money on the 90% that work great with the br2 don't you don't buy a whole bunch of br2 Pros just because you want to cover that 10% variance you buy the br2 because you want to use 5G Broadband replacement but if your mission only needs a couple megabits of throughput the br2 and the transit Duo are going to be fine it's if you're looking for that 100 Meg by 10m connection you want that broadband connection all the time that's when you go to the br2 pro and and so you know if but if you don't need that then then don't waste the money as much as I would love to sell them to you and and peplink would probably love to ship them to you that's that's not the mission though and so so build out based on your mission but understand that some sites that might not be enough and we just have to accept that as as a as necessity yep and again mixing and matching those two models doesn't create more work for you from the same firewall policy same outbound policy same same zero touch configuration um and so so it's a nice thing to have there and we talk about pep so we're going to move on to uh we only got eight minutes left so I'm G to get these last two slides in but we talk about peplink Solutions it's so funny too because every time I think oh there's not enough slides we're not going to have enough content and then sure enough it's like oh my gosh we're always running out of time uh it's so funny to me I think the eim thing is another really big one for yeah for ret and it goes right into uh Chris who just asked about omns or multi-carrier Sims is how we refer to it and and the answer Chris is sometimes um you know when you're talking about multi-carrier Sims usually there's there's a level of uh metered uh uh feet function to it so when you're talking so depending on the bandwidth utilization you want to evaluate your plans if you're going to do full Broadband replacement Verizon at& T-Mobile have Broadband plants they'll give you hundreds of gigabytes for a fraction of for pennies on the dollar um and so you you you want to make sure and I there are now inbo plans omnisim or multi-car Sims that offer Broadband plans as well giving you hundreds of gigabytes but if you buy a metered plan an iot SIM that's you know four to to $18 a gig and you plug that in and then you plug give a guest Wi-Fi and run 25 terabytes you're gonna be mad when you get that bill um so be aware of the data consumption that you're using and if you're new to it watch it daily if you're on a metered plan and you think hey I'm I I might be okay with this that's you know I'm just running my point of sale transactions couple gigabytes a month it's way more cost effective to do a metered plan or or M you know multi you know sort some sort of multi-carrier plan just make sure that the bandwidth consumption is matching your expectations on cost um because they're not forgiving so so if you are um but if you know what you're consuming heck yeah and and then for everybody else Broadband plans give you a lot of gigabytes for a a much better fixed monthly cost and so you can you can maximize minimize the cost per gigabyte that way and there are uh nvno or multi-carrier Sims now that are offering Broadband plans so you can always look into those as well where you're looking at Verizon AT&T to mobile I do recommend diversity I think diversity is by far one of the most powerful things to uh our ecosystem our our internet ecosystem in America is that we have the ability to choose a carrier and when you're talking about owning your own equipment like we talked about previously there's no contracts they're not going to lock you you buy I can buy a T-Mobile SIM an AT&T SIM or R Sim if I'm buying just the data plan that's no contract so if it's not working at one store or it doesn't work well enough I can switch to a different one and it's not a big deal um I own the equipment I own the infrastructure so I don't have to worry about that um and for those of you that know that how much bandwidth you're using peplink has amazing data plans um that to to solve that or other multi-carrier cap capabilities and so the peping eim has a built-in program that you can actually buy 10 20 100 or even a terabyte of data and have it managed for your entire 100 200 500 1,000 locations and you have one data pool all three carriers and there's also other multi-carrier Sims out there that are great and they work with and you can push those eims directly to the peplink router so if you don't like the peping state of plans you can bring your own you can bring your own carriers you can bring your own Broadband plans and you can bring your own Eeps so that's another thing about peping you own the network we're just providing you tools um and that's really important if you're a carrier a multi uh Sim carrier we we'll work with you we're we're not like we're not trying to compete against that but for someone looking for really easy 10 20 terabyte of data that they can just buy and deploy it's phenomenal um it's built right into in control and the ecosystem it's incredibly powerful yeah peping Zim like you said works with all third party Sims right you you don't have to buy the Sim data plan from peping to use the eim you can just use the QR code you can use the carriers provisioning tools push those eims out that works with all those all those plans but then the peplink eim data plan there's no monthly cost there's no monthly cost it doesn't matter how many stores you have 500 stores there's no monthly cost I'm GNA no monthly cost right so what I normally do Travis and I've had a lot of fun with this is I buy I I buy a one terabyte um pool plan on for for West networks and literally if I need like immediate provisioning to bring a side online oh what's your serial number oh and I just type it in I give it 500 megabytes of data and then I bring it online I can program it I can support it and then I just delete the esm and I get my 500 you know 480 gigabytes megabytes back um and so um we as a company we just buy the dat we just buy a one terabyte plan and we just keep reloading the one terab plan and it is it is stupid convenient if I'm not how to say that on on a webinar like the ability to just I mean I've even had like we like I said we work with some of the big carriers like hey can you load one of your eims real fast and we'll load up the eim program the APN get it all configured and I just delete the then I delete the data and so I get all my data back um and so as a as a as a IT guy the ability to just quickly provision any router without ever having to think about what's plugged into to it that the peplink data plan is awesome for that I it's incredibly powerful yeah people will sit and look at dollars per gig and it's just that's not the that's not the point here right the point is you can scale it to hundreds of locations you can do it for short little bits of time it's that convenience tool it's that it's that failover plan that actually works for people's budgets finally right it's a different animal than that carriers fixed Wireless unlimited Broadband right it's not that yep go to them for that so we talk about immediate connectivity with peplink routers Ian provides zero day instant connectivity um so we you know we we've kind of beat that one down uh this this session so I'll leave that one alone um we actually talked about the pin contas a maximize your 4G and 5G through but so once it's in streamlining ecosystem you can use one partner tech support for your Hardware um needs so you get the the pink router and the antennas as a as a unified solution um and then finally reliable backup battery make sure that your router has a backup battery um keep it up and running and if you have a whole bunch of network equipment it's a lot harder to keep it up and running during a power outage when you have a little tiny Transit duo or br2 or BR you know um and that's all you're running running at 12 Watts you can run for hours on a standard phone battery system uh peplink also now releas that USBC to a 12volt power adapter so now we have a 12 Vol power that goes to dual USBC which means you can power plug it into a wall outlet and plug it into a battery and literally have uninterrupted power with just a simple USBC power dock um so the the USBC I I don't know if you know that part number uh off the top of your head Travis but the that USBC cable um it's okay if you don't the uhu but you know the ability to have and then what's also cool is you go to two USBC power blanks and actually hot swap them because so you can you could run a l a long time and so you don't have to have an expensive system and that's what we're trying to get at retail location when you're talking about 400 500 10,000 locations every additional purchase is multiplied by 10,000 and so if I can keep that cost low if I can if I can make sure that it's scalable and supportable then um we can uh more than happy to uh push that out um you know keep that cost low for your retail locations I'm going to put a link to all the peplink accessories in the chat as well because that includ that cable and all these other cool things that we have again this is the ecosystem the platform we've got a lot of these details figured out already so you don't have to stress about those two and um yeah so then um I talked about this already it's simple to deploy um so you have your your your Wi-Fi 6 a you have your 4G or 5G connectivity you can plug in your different vlans for secure point of sale guest networks staff networks keeping everything isolated and it's one piece of equipment one piece of equipment that requires low power easy to manage easy to SC scale um and you can even create vpns with our speed Fusion VPN going back to your corporate headquarters if if you have non-cloud connected systems and so the idea is simple to deploy easy to manage um less Hardware less cost making retail deployments incredibly resilient and reliable and scalable and we're we've already kind of ran out of time answering some questions on the Fly I I'll leave it open for one or two more questions if you have any questions um but otherwise this is just another pep L University series once again we're trying to launch peplink university.com which will have all of this information centralized for you uh resources links to training Etc um yes we have uh devices with three Wan ports um the the balance 380 the 305 also the B1 is dual Wan but has a VW so you can turn one of the landan ports into a w ports so the b15g is dual ethernet Wan with a with a virtual Wan which means you can convert the um the ethernet into the ethernet Lan into a Wan that gives you three um any of our routers that support VW which is almost all of them now you can convert land ports into Wan ports you can buy either a single or dual or even triple uh VW license and basically extend the number of Wan ports but the the B1 5G uh the balance 380x um is is a great little uh triple Wan router with the 5G module capabilities um the 310 5G with the VW license once again would give you the three the three WS that you would need as well so those would be my recommendations uh for triple W routers yeah the number of physical labeled Wan ports is less it's sort of ambiguous these days yeah I like I was doing this job just the other this weekend with the sdx only has two ethernet ws and I needed I needed more ws and I literally just bought a two VW pack license pack had it pushed out in a few minutes and then you know lit lit up my additional WS so with the VW license you can convert land ports into W ports or even trunk WS over your land through your idfs um so that gives incredible scalability uh scalability there but otherwise um thank you so much if you have any questions you can email Travis pink.com or new email address peterw pink.com uh so you can email uh email us and ask questions directly and if there's anything that you need uh please let us know and we this once again will be published this these slides and video will be published uh to Pink's YouTube uh Channel and uh and will be coming to peplink university.com as well and then if you like this content I'm G throw this out there real fast uh hopefully Travis will let me um we offering we offer on-site training so we have the peplink tech Summit coming in November uh peplink techsummit domcom um and you can learn uh peplink certified sales peplink certified associate as well as the new peplink certified engineer meet and greet uh fellow peplink uh enthusiasts and learn about the technology um so it's going be November 3rd in Orlando Florida peplink techsummit tocom uh I hope you can join us there otherwise thank you so much thank you Travis for once again hosting and and having this amazing dialogue yeah Peter thank you as always as well this is great again and everybody thanks for joining thanks for looking into peplink we'll talk to you in a month talk to you next month bye bye"}

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "well hello everybody uh my name is Peter West the professor P um and with me we have Travis from peplink Peter I love the the blurb on the slide live from somewhere on I75 I I thought that would be funny is just you know just kind of you know I'm actually sitting uh in a in a Arby's parking lot um somewhere Northbound on uh I75 in Georgia um so I'm presenting for my speed Fusion backpack um uh I've got my two 5gs I've got my my cell phone tethered and then I've got my car that comes with like that built-in Wi-Fi and so that's um so I've kind of got my my my car Wi-Fi my cell phone and then the built-in br2 Wii or bonding which I'll demonstrate here in a little bit um but today we're going to talk about what I've been doing for the last 15 years which is transportation connectivity Mobility um healthc Care Broad C rvers uh you know row what what do you call me Nomad you know out in the out in the field trying to just make sure you can work from anywhere and so this one touches close to home for me because this is actually what West networks does on a daily basis is solve connectivity problems um for a number of verticals but really challenging Mobility space and um and so I'm really excited to talk about that today today and uh yeah let's get started yeah great so um the first uh we're going to talk about is some of the challenges that people face on the road um and kind of how peplink maybe maybe addresses some of these things as well uh you know the one of the first things is location challenges power and environmental I can't tell you from the you know thousands of installs that I've done is that the ability to to work um be able to provide Power to units changes every single install almost it's like do they have a generator with AC are they running 12vt are we tapping into a you know like what I'm doing I'm just plugged into a us you know the little cigarette lighter um you know how how are we able to provide Power and and one of the nice things about peplink is that we have all sorts of power inputs uh USBC regular you know Poe DC AC most routers have more than one power input and so you're able to really adapt easily to power concerns um and now peplink just recently released that new uh what I'm sure you know the part number but the ACW uh dual USBC uh to DC power input um and so now you two two two batteries in and actually hot swap batteries for continuous use um and so phenomenal cap ability there for um uh for for power distribution and and making sure that you could power these devices while on the road and then the other thing too is with environmental is is ruggedized is making sure they don't melt um or overheat and so P most ruggedized peplink routers not not not the the Soho devices but our ruggedized devices are -40 to 140 Fen height meaning they they support I mean almost all environmental situations obviously I know there are some that exceed that but almost all environmental situations and I I one time did an install and a mobile a mobile health unit where the they they actually they had another product and it melted like it actually melt it it overheated it was a plastic enclosure they had it shoved between a printer and a and a book and it just I like oh my internet's not working can you come install one of your devices I went down there well just so you know like that's not let not shove it between a book and a printer let's let's put it on a shelf where it has a little bit of ventilation but um uh yeah it was it was crazy you couldn't even pull out the the RJ45 because it had all melted together um so it was pretty fun for us because you know we come with the rugged the rugged but really any any router would have suffered in that environment with being shoved with no ventilation yeah you like 15 years working with peplink and that that's something that really stands out for me is like all the customer calls that I've gotten on where they they really really push right you know that they've had that that melted router experience and they're like are you sure this is going to hold up you know we're in Arizona or we're in Dubai or we're in pick a crazy hot place you can think of and yeah we don't have those failure rates we don't have those problems it's it's good and then the next challenge that we typically face is um bandwidth requirements in in this used to be less of an issue I mean I've been doing this for a long time 3G connectivity on wind farms and stuff um this used to be less of an issue like for like rvers and passengers and things like that where they you know it's like can I check my email or maybe do a a a basic internet traffic but with Netflix and YouTube and Hulu and and teams like I'm working with you right now over zoom and teams and things like that bandwidth has become a standard demand um people want more and more capacity as they go mobile if I'm going to be mobile I need to be connected I need to have bandwidth and so what we find is that even though one internet connection uh can can provide good throughput especially in a nice uh metropolitan area they're not stable at scale and they they I don't want to like I love all I love so many carriers that there there there's no stability at scale and then they're diverse sometimes they could be great sometimes they can not be great so what I A lot of times what I try to say is no one connection is perfect because they don't work everywhere a and so what we try to do is can we get more connections and that's where peplink really starts to show um it's it's girth is ability to use multiple internet connections at the same time and so with bandwidth bonding we provide faster upload and download speeds we have multiple cellular routers or even starlink now and then hot failover for constant uptime um and so the idea is by using bandwidth bonding and hot failover we can really achieve increased stability and reliability while working on the field or working out the you know roaming around and so we like to be able to achieve those goals um and then another challenge that people have is a high LEL security EXP to ensure privacy and security is something that I get people ask me about often and they think of peplink as a as a Wan Appliance not a security Appliance and I have a fire a whole webinar on firewalls but it's neat to know that peplink not only do we have bandwidth bonding and we're ruggedized and we can have multiple SIM cards and starlink and other internet connections we also have a really nice firewall um not I'm not going to say it's the best firewall but a really nice firewall we have content filtering application blocking layer 7even capabilities DPI aware um inbound outbound and internal firewall policies with regional and SAS capabilities and if you don't know what those terms are watch my firewall webinar but my point though is is that you know it security is becoming more and more of a requirement even for consumers even for just uh making sure that you know you're your browsing habits and you're protect you're being protected while you're traversing around the country uh or the world and you want to make sure that you have a router that has a good firewall and so peplink with our integrated firewall and I'll demonstrate some of those features today um allows for some peace of mind when it comes to security and then when we talk about we we expand from the RV and the The Nomad the sing the the individual running around trying to do a zoom meeting and we go to fleets and lots of devices we want be able to scale this I want to be able to scale um you know hundreds or thousands of devices and so when we take this amazing hardware and software platform and we combine it with in control management now we have zero touch deployment we have the ability to configure policies push those out to tens of thousands of routers in seconds and it's incredibly powerful tool to be able to have WiFi and firewall and access controlling lists and zero touch configuration of your speed Fusion bonding capabilities all from in control Cloud management and so and then you that it has GPS built right in oh go ahead Travis yeah I think that scaling is a big deal like you said not just multiple locations but geographies right you've got people in different locations that's one comment I hear all the time from customers in these mobile deployments is hey like you guys understand there's not going to be an IT person at this vehicle right like I need to be able to run this thing from anywhere and yeah that's exactly what you're talking about I had a I was on a call last week with a with a healthcare uh facility and it the IT director you know and and and I get this all the time so nothing on this IT director but he kind of started getting nervous like like how am I supposed to be in seven different C counties while you're traveling around providing desktop support like I I like I I don't want to like that that seems like a you know a resource that I'm I'm kind of nervous to take on and and I started showing them in control and how we manage the routers and how we can use InTouch to RDP or VNC into desktops and how we can use InTouch to remote control a printer and so it's like from from in control from this one pane of glass I can manage my desktops on the mobile health unit I can manage my printers my cameras my NVR I can make sure that my iot appliances I don't have to deploy a technician to troubleshoot something simple um and so it it it by having in control and zero touch management and in touch it really brings that power to the to the technician you know so he doesn't have to worry about you know which county are you in today and how many hours is it going to take me to drive out to to provide Sol a service solution so um really powerful um Tech you know kind of application Suite yeah I think you and I take it for granted because it's just built in it's automatic it's been there forever and so new customers just don't have that Comfort level and they they have not lived that way before and then it's it's it's pretty easy to get used to but it's not obvious at first to some to new customers and it kind of blows their their minds too like like let me just log into this like you know I I was trying to do some service for a customer uh on a kind of unique scenario and so I used Docker spun up an auntu uh VNC into the an auntu and I ran all the command and the customer like like just floored um with the the capabilities that that we were able to do in a matter of seconds and then fix that problem that the customer is having yeah um so then then we talk about the nature of Mobility creates a complex dependability um on providers due to the in motion and multi multilocation nature of Transit I had to read that because I wanted to make sure I clarified that properly but the the the as good as everybody wants to be they can't provide a 100% coverage I I mean I I am loving T-Mobile Standalone right now it is amazing but everybody has their challenges everybody I mean it's impossible for them to provi provide complete 100% coverage and while you're moving while you're in motion you have interference from trucks driving by you have Bridges and trees if you're worried about starlink you have you know you have interference caused by o other signals as you're traversing uh the country and so we want to make sure that we can we can combat that as simplistic as oh my gosh as simplistic as possible I don't want to you know I part of that same conversation last week was well can we have a dashboard to train people how to switch go you don't need to with pink I don't need to have a dashboard I don't want the users even touching the router it's going to because we have multi-wan capabilities because we can have Verizon and T-Mobile and AT&T and starlink and one web or anything else that we want to plug into it Wi-Fi W I'm I'm Wi-Fi my my my my car's hotspot right now and so I Wi-fi Wan and you know ethernet Wan and things like that literally the idea is as as these as these mobile units are traveling around the enduser is not thinking about how that connection is it's just working and providing them connection and I cannot stress that enough it's one of the biggest things that people notice about peplink when they're switching from a different provide uh Hardware vendor they're going wait a second I don't have to reboot when the tunnel goes down nope it'll it'll self-heal it's going to recover itself I don't need to worry about rebooting when it doesn't work if you have to reboot something else is wrong and and and so you know that's that's that's a one a big thing that we try to play play on it's it's don't reboot if if it's not working let's let's look into why it's not working because there's something else wrong and and um and it it makes it it creates a whole different scenario or you know uh whole different look at the at the at the environment when when a technician's going wait a second so the answer isn't reboot it's it's what what's not working right now what happened um and so anyways that's that's a whole different offshoot of of convers station um and then you know as we travel around then once again having a good good signal um and so high gain antennas and the the modem chipset matters probably as much as I would love to say our bonding and our capabilities but actually matter the most you need to have a good antenna and you have to have a good modem it's it's a requirement I and and that's I I was on another uh sales meeting and I thought it was was really cool one of the one of the U isps was was we were talking and he goes one of the coolest things like about peplink is that they don't have four-year-old chipsets on their new motives they're they're always looking at the latest chipsets the latest modems to make sure that we're staying on top of the on top of the game and um making sure the performance is the best yeah there's basically you know there's already a second generation of 5G chips sets the market we've been shipping those with our products the whole year but most vendors out there aren't don't even have a product certified on the second generation or even the first generation you know if you look at the big vendors they don't even have 5G products or they're just coming out with them so yeah they're still running cat for yeah yeah it's just like you see these LTE products from these big names getting registered on the carrier sites every day it's just like what why did they do that what what was that for and honestly that can also be a of frustration too um but you gotta think of it like cell phones like you know you get an iPhone 12 and then the iPhone 13 and then the iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 it's not just the hardware it's also the wireless chip the modem the the processor the the the module they they're running the latest modules so you compare a iPhone 15 Pro Max with millimeter wave to a seven-year-old br1 mini Cat 3 it's not going to be as fast it's going to be different and so those modems we got to keep up with those modems but also we need to make sure we have antennas that can send and receive the signal that we're trying to achieve and and so by having the latest modems and High Gain antennas we increase that opportunity for really reliable connectivity and I always talking about like an opportunity cost it's a we're we're we're trying to maximize the opportunity of connections and so by having good antennas good mems we're able to maximize that that connection opportunity and then we take the speed Fusion and the multi-wan and the diversity and the you know the other features to be able to maximize the utilization of those modems um and so it's kind of like you get both you got you gotta have both um yeah the antennas matter a lot on the 5G world people I see this all the time customers they try to take 4G antennas and plug the 5G unit in they say okay well I've only got two antennas which ones should I plug them into no start start over get four rip it out and put a new one in yep do it the way 5G is supposed to work right it will work way better and it will give you much better range and speed yeah 100 per. and then cellular congestion creates bandwidth issues in high density environments and and so cellular congestion is something if especially if you're a broadcast or first responder um this we're really speaking to you in this right now is that you're at the the the Super Bowl you're at at a football game and you got 100,000 people around you have congestion issues this is not about receiving a signal it's about there's 800 you know well that's that's anant there's 100,000 people on the towers sucking up a gigabit pipe or a 10 gigabit pipe and there's just not enough internet to go around um and so my old way to talk about this which we still agree with is is quantity so if if and just to break the math down a little bit if there's a hundred people if there's 10 people on the network and 100 megabits of of internet and they're all using at the same time there's 10 Megs per person if I'm two of those people have two SIM cards now I have 20 mags of throughput instead of 10 mags well you take that if there's a gig pipe in a thousand people you only have one Meg a person that's not I mean a gig seems like a lot but when you have a thousand people on the tower that's only one Meg per person and so now give it they're all not using at the same time there there's there's there's algorithms and ways to optimize this but the point though is is that it's important to understand that congestion is a battle that that especially the broadcasters and the First Responders have to deal with and so there's two ways that we handle that the first is dis just uh diversity have multiple SIM cards and maybe you have multiple versions of each carrier so have two AT&T two Verizon two T-Mobile um then we have Dynamic weighted bonding Dynamic weighted bonding is monitoring the the connection from the mo your mobile router to your Hub to your to your Fusion Hub or your balance router or your speed Fusion connect and it's monitoring the packet loss and latency and Jitter to detect congestion and maximize the utilization of each circuit so if T-Mobile can give me 150 Megs down and AT&T is giving me 50 I'm no longer throttling the T-Mobile to the 50 mags of the AT&T the T-Mobile can get 150 the T the AT&T can get 50 the Verizon get 100 and I can maximize each one of those circuits um together uh and so Dynamic weighted bonding combined with multiple SIM cards really increases the ability to combat congestion specifically yeah and I think Dynamic weed bonding just can't be undersold here because you know we're starting to see a few people in the market introduce bonding finally right pink we've been doing it for 15 years right this isn't new to us but we're starting to see a few players out there that that are talking about bonding but peping is just hands down the fastest highest performance most efficient way to bond connections period nobody can come even close to our 15 years of experience doing this and that shows up in every side of the market right Peter You've Won projects against the biggest sd1 players in the world because Pink's technology was superior but that same algorithm is also in these lowend 599999 mobile products so you can have that capability anywhere the the not not that this discussion is about that but one of the biggest problems with these other Solutions is most of them are just taking advantage of multipath TCP and it's not actually bonding um so they're just they're thrown up on like an AWS multipath TCP host and then basically creating that session for you um and so it's important to understand that packet based bonding and what we can do by monitoring the health of each circuit versus just a multipath TCP very different utilization of the Technologies um where we have like I said like like Travis mentioned we have 15 years of experience optimizing and monitoring and managing and maximizing the capacity of these circuits not just throwing some open standard out there and hoping that it works um to just boil it all down what that all means it behaves like what Peter was talking about at the beginning where you don't have to think about which connection should I use now what should I do here what should I do there that's that people have that experience because our algorithms work so well and are so Dynamic and automatic and able to adjust real time like that amen and then one of the last things that we just wanted to plug here is more of just a little sales plug but a lot of times people C like how do I know which is the carry is the best and and we don't right they they differ by square miles almost and so or even block sometimes but so peplink also has um our eim data plant and so you can load multiple profiles so if you can load Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T onto your modem via VIA eim profiles or you can use sfc data and you can actually have a single data plan that lets you test all the carriers so you know what to provide and what to connect and so using either sfc um 5 G to be able to switch between your carriers or the ability to have eims and plug in directly AT&T Verizon T-Mobile and have all three of those together creates a massive increased opportunity for the best possible connection and so we you know eims and and our sfc 5G uh you know combined with Dynamic weighted bonding combined with the high high high gain antennas and the multi-wan and everything we just mentioned puts together a package that creates in incredible resiliency and reliability on the road yeah I think those eims are are something a lot of people don't really appreciate but you know like like you said kind everybody's got their carrier that they like and they're you know maybe they're in this area most often and I know t- mobile or Verizon or AT&T works best here or there so everybody's got that kind of first carrier figured out that's not too hard to to get a SIM card and get that activated and maybe you're going to add it onto your existing plan that you got all your other lines but yeah when you go into that area where that carrier just happens to not be so great and maybe you're only there 5% of your time but now you're down again and you're back to the old way of doing things and so those eim plans are great for filling in those gaps so you don't have to go find a whole another contract with the whole another carrier and pay a whole another monthly bill right you can just pay for the year and get that kind of failover backup roaming whatever you want to call it but make that experience easy and again take one more question out of the whole process of how do I do now amen and so so now we've kind of gone over the generic that covers all of these so you know we wanted to introduce you to the basics of of peplink and mobility and so now we talk about connectivity for your your vertical or for your mission um and um there are a lot of missions by the way uh we we wanted to I mean I could talk for hours on this so I you know I kind of picked some the the five that that I thought fit well um for the major of our customers understanding there's a lot of uh verticals out there that that's that are we're trying to solve problems for um but basically have like essential connectivity passenger connectivity critical connectivity healthc care and broadcast and so we're going to talk about and the reason why I broke this up is because between those five groups it kind of covers the plethora of peplink Hardware te um Technologies and and I get asked all the time why do you have so many routers why can't you just to have a router and it's because we have a lot of different customers with different needs and not there's not one router that's fixed I mean I guess I guess if everybody bought an epx then fine you know great but I I don't think we're gonna install epx in ATM machines and so you know we wanted to have you know we we need to have Hardware that solves your mission and everybody's mission is slightly different so we can so we we we're going to categorize this into these five five categories and show you hardware and technology that complement those categories and why we have the different Hardware that we have and you'll see overlaps here by the way so the first is going to be essential essential connectivity and the the idea here is there are people out there that there whether it's iot um or you know just just a dash cam or a monitor or a sensor basically they're trying to um use low bandwidth with normal reliability um and they're trying to create that connection so they can use in control and in touch maybe Fleet Management with GPS um and create this reliability connection and so we have the br1 mini 5G and the br1 mini 5G is a lowcost 5G adapter or router and that's what's nice about this you could plug this into an existing infrastructure like uh a non- peplink firewall or you can plug this right into your vehicle and have it set up for um you know basically nice 5G connectivity anywhere you go um not really designed for your high bandwidth applications but it's designed for your your iot and once again normal reliability um and so that's why we've categorized this under um essential connectivity the next thing we have is passenger connectivity and right here we have connectivity for rvers but this would really be connectivities for rvers buses public transportation anytime you want to have passengers with Wi-Fi and the idea is you could have um a Transit Pro or br1 Pro 5G and the other one that should have been here is a br2 pro 5G um but the idea here is um high bandwidth with normal reliability and so you'll see why we go into more high high bandwidth require or higher reliability the idea is they're going to use more bandwidth higher higher bandwidth but they're not the the mission isn't extreme reliability if you don't get that high bandwidth for a few minutes it's okay um you know you're usually streaming Netflix or YouTube checking your email running a teams meeting or you know running a zoom meeting um and trying to travel around and you want to keep the cost low the bandwidth is high as possible but it's not critical that the bandwidth is High um and so what's neat about the transit Duo is you can you can um synergize them and basically and I've got a whole video on this and basically make a a really budget friendly quad 5G or 4G Appliance um or you can use the br1 pro 5G which has Wi-Fi 6 to broadcast it's going to cover your entire vehicle with good Wi-Fi 6 connectivity it has the 5G chip there and then you could also pair that with a with a starlink to give you better roaming and capability in areas that maybe you don't have any 5G service but the hardware cost is going to be lower um you're only going to have one sim card plan for the br1 pro 5G so your monthly cost is going to be lower as well but you're going to get you're going to be able to get the high bandwidth of 5G but with that standard reliability understand that some spaces might be less yeah I think one way to think about that you know on the single side I heard it explained to me is like okay if you pick the 5G device what's your maximum you're maybe going to see like 300 megabits per second out in the real world on that thing sometimes maybe a little bit more but you know you get into that congested or or kind of crunch scenario and let's take that maybe you've got maybe that Tower is 90% loaded well now I'm at like you know 20 or 30 megabits per second my my downside is pretty good still where if I started out with a low l speed 4G device maybe my Peaks 40 50 Megs get 90% crunched down and I'm only at you know two or four Megs now so yeah when you start out with that faster more capable device the worst case scenario is going to be better still both on coverage and and on the throughput overall but and on top of that I mean we talk about the that's where I talk classify like normal or standard reliability right those variances in the throughput are okay okay versus when you talk about a high availability which we're going to start to go to we need to make sure we those those Peaks stay more constant so high high reliability we're actually talking about reliability of the circuit and that's why you know the transit Duo for example is dual 4G so it the Peaks are going to be lower but it's going to have increased bandwidth because we can have two of them together we're going to bond those together so that's sort of a middle ground of higher reliability but but maybe the Peaks aren't as high because it's not 5G but we're still keeping the budget low for for Trans for passenger connectivity the other cool thing about passenger connectivity is Ping technologies that really are strength that are strong here are built-in captive portal so not only do we have the ability to have um good internet we also have the ability to have a captive portal so if you're a transportation like a bus company you can have hey here's my bus company and when they log in especially on the transit Duo Pro you then have application caching so you can your own internal website that says here's our media and you can have content there that you can stream with Docker or application caching built into the router so you can have you know videos. yourbus company.com and actually have videos that they can watch that are stored locally on the device and not even consuming data so you know everybody could watch one or two movies for a two-hour bus ride or a 4H hour bus ride and not consume any data and so there's some neat Technologies built into the router that allow for even better passenger experiences like um Docker and and uh application caching yeah I think those are those are all the details that get overlooked so easily and then you start you know then on our side we see these kind of like Frankenstein solutions that end up because somebody picked this router because it was the cheapest and it connected and all that was great but then they realized oh shoot I need this captive portal solution so they plug this Wi-Fi access point into that router you know they start kind of like hodg podging all these things in to solve these details that they didn't really realize they were going to face on the front end and with pink it we've got all these Hardware models so you can just get the right size but then we've got all this software behind it that works with any of those models so you've got that that common experience no matter which one you picked exactly and so then we talk about critical connectivity and it's weird this is a very weird topic because I have two really high performing r outers that that then we talk about low bandwidth when we talk about critical connectivity we're talking about police cars and ambulances and fire trucks but then they also have command Vehicles so they have they have the the the the critical response Vehicles so when you talk about a police car an ambulance a firetruck they actually don't have a high bandwidth need what they need is super reliable bandwidth so they don't need it to be high they need to be incredibly reliable on those police cars and so when I talk about the br2 the reason why I recommend this instead of the transit duo or another router is because the band frequency the br2 pro 5G is dual 5G so it actually has a really high upend um but if you talk about the high upend for for high bandwidth the the the higher the bandwidth requirement the lower the stability or reliability of that bandwidth will be with less SIM cards so the idea with the br2 is low bandwidth super high reliability or high bandwidth normal reliability so you can kind of flip that around with the br2 and and so with the br2 the reason why I recommend this for First Responders is the 5G chipset offers more frequency more bands higher bonding capacity which means that for their low bandwidth needs like like Travis just said a second ago the highs are going to be awesome but the lows are still going to be exactly what they need to complete the mission so you pull into 100,000 people and you've still got five or six or 10 or 15 megabits of throughput that's all a command a police car needs to be able to stream their videos to access their their systems their Cad and their their reporting Pro uh programs and so so that's where the br2 pro is an amazing opportunity for low bandwidth super reliable and and that's the difference there it's a weird it's a weird one that you might not think about and that's why I wanted to have this because the the routers can fit multiple different platforms then we go into command Vehicles oh go ahead sorry one way to think about it that just kind of hit me is like you know like you said it's not about the speed right that 500 megabits per second on 5G doesn't do the police car anything right but if you think about it like a fishing net maybe like your modem is like how big your net is right these 5G modems have all of the frequencies all of the bands and so they're a really wide net so they can catch any of the bandwidth coming off of that cellular network where if you've got a really small older 4G device you don't have that much bandwidth you can even catch to begin with so you're competing with everybody else with a much smaller Net versus these big Nets that and so again it's not about that Peak it's keeping things good when there's not much to catch there yep I like that and then for command Vehicles they need more bandwidth but they still need that super reliability and that's where the hd4 mbx comes in now we have four SIM cards four 5G modems we can have three two or three star lengths or you could have more 5G modems with USB expansion so there's actually two USB ports there so you have a total of six 5G modems with the max adapter um and then like I said three ethernet Wan so you can have starlink or even additional 5G modems and so the the hd4 mbx provides Poe land ports increased Hardware reliability ability but also incredible scaleability to achieve that to to accomplish that mission so the hd4 mbx has more SIM cards that 5gn platform um so we're gonna once again get that super reliability that we need not necessarily pushing high bandwidth um that we're going to talk about in the next couple categories so it's still I would still a medium to low bandwidth requirement compared to some of these next couple categories but super reli able bandwidth and that's where that hd4 comes in on your command Vehicles so the br2 for your police cars ambulance and firet trucks the hd4 for your command Vehicles gives you guarante almost guaranteed low bandwidth that you're going to low and medium bandwidth for your for your mission but super reliable and then you pair that with speed Fusion VPN for AES 256 TLS 1.3 nist compliant security we're going to have that that encryption and security you need for your for your traffic so you don't have to have an additional VPN topology like um some of these uh software-based uh vpns you're going to be able to Hardware VPN this right into your environment to create a super secure stable connection for your uh first responder critical connectivity Vehicles Healthcare uh this is uh this is my baby right here so I I I live in the healthcare World um for the most part of my uh my journey through speed fusion and um and we've played around with products a lot and um Healthcare we call high high B bandwidth High reliability this is one of the most challenging environments um to provide connectivity because when you're doing like dcom Imaging for example like packs and x-ray images if you lose a single packet the entire image has to retransmit because that could be a false positive or false negative that is not seen for for an image radiology image and so that it it has to be incredibly reliable but they also need a lot of bandwidth so it's high bandwidth and high reliability um and that's a challenge um to overcome and we've done this with these high performance routers let me talk about the two categories that I that I take into for he healthc care the first one is Tella Health Services tella health services are very similar to our our our critical response or our Police Services we need to be able to have kind of a medium or normal bandwidth super high reliability um and so we have the br2 and the hd4 this is going to allow you to use Wan smoothing to be able to do teams calls and voice calls for tella Health operations access their EMR their epic or their their other platform they might use for health care services um and be able to work on the mo on the road and you can pair that with starlink to increase the diversity and capabilities as you roam around the country but then we go into our high bandwidth needs for MRIs CT mamography Dem Dental Imaging th this is a challenge that that is that is seldom addressed by by most uh by kind of like local it because they go how do I solve this problem and I don't know like I'm gonna throw a throw a router out there and and so I wanted to put this slide out here so that basically it was public knowledge of what we're trying to do with the sdx and the domes or the epx and built-in 5G we could combine 10 well eight to 16 internet connection 5G internet connections together to create incredibly high bandwidth High reliability connection back to the hospital this means realtime Imaging real time CT Real Time MRI real time mography real time Dental we're transmitting images as if they're sitting in the hospital and we're doing that by bonding up to up to 16 5G motives you could do more but it's not that it's not like the physical space on the roof with air conditionings and things like that um and it's not necessary I guess but the idea is we combine up to 16 5G modems together to create an incredibly highly reliable high bandwidth solution and one of the things that I really like about this especially in the healthcare world because they're high bandwidth means it means they're using lots of terabytes well the the carriers sometimes they go oh man terabytes means dedicated data plan that's what they're going to try to sell you dedicated data plan well if I have just just say 10 if I have 10 SIM cards and I have 10 300 gigabyte Broadband plans now I'm only paying pennies per gigabyte on the data plan because I'm buying a Broadband plan but I have 10 of them so I have three terabytes of capacity on this this router so that the ROI of buying one of these 10 cellular devices compared to paying for three terabytes of data is almost one month I kid you not the ROI of the data plan itself is incredibly valuable to these health care facilities and if you think about most mobile Healthcare they're serving underprivileged areas almost all of mobile Healthcare it's can I reach people that can't be served and so they're running on a budget how do I save money and provide this service how do I make sure that I can see these people and provide them the same quality service that they would get if they were in a hospital and that's why this is so close to home for me it's it's my passion it's they're serving people that can't be served and so we got to keep the cost down we got to make sure it's fast and reliable and we got to make sure they can they can they can serve their Community now CT and MRI it's a little bit different that's about speed they got to save lives in a matter of seconds they get a couple minutes to decide what medication to deploy and so once again we increased reliability and throughput um and so we're able to combine those SIM cards to create a lot of gigabytes a lot of terabytes for them to to be able to provide that service and creating that like Hospital environment and that's the power of the sdx and epx when you talk about mobile healthc care it's it's incredibly powerful um and provides the bandwidth and reliability at the cost savings or the cost that they need it to be and then to make all things awesome pair that with starlink throw two or three or four starlinks and now you have I mean basically complete Countrywide connectivity without ever having to to to skip a beat um and so yeah it's a it's an incredible combination of technology that has pep Link's years of experience but adds into making the most robust mobile network you can possibly have what what I love about this Peter and I can just hear it coming out of your voice is like you're not building a mobile hotspot or a mobile connection here you're building a hospital grade Network it just happens to be in a vehicle right you're not building this as like oh I can't have everything I want so I'm just going to give them this pretty good thing right no you're building a hospital grade Network networ and it's in those Vehicles so they can use it anywhere like you said and so it's not you know this is a mobile conversation but you've been able to take this template to all kinds of other brick and mortar facilities on top of that because you're building it just like a network would engineer would design a new facility right I've got this diversity on my connections and this diversity on my power options and these are the things that make these networks reliable and it's the same thing here it's a lot of fun too uh to to show these hospitals it's like you can have you can have a hospital on Wheels with peplink and you know it and then they apply it to their buildings they go wait a second if that works out here can I add that to my branches you know they have a fiber cut and they go so I can have internet as fast as my fiber out in the field and yes you can and so not only can you apply this to Mobility but it can be your branches as well but this is a Mobility uh webinar the next one is broadcast um broadcasters have have really leaned on 5G and starlink to achieve real-time transmission capabilities um at immense cost savings over traditional means or even just over comp more complicated means like dedicated microwave towers and things like that and so the ability to have H extremely high bandwidth with extremely high reliability comes into play with the same kind of topic we were having had before but with the epx and hd4 mvx and then pairing that with starlink and other internet connections like your Venue internet and your Venue Wi-Fi um pairing with taking all the internet that I can get because usually a broadcaster goes out and they buy a gigabit line they have internet where they go but it but you got to remember when a broad when an event is over when when when the president speaks and then he's done it's gun it's done it cannot fail and that's where the extreme reliability here if it takes an extra three minutes to transmit uh mobile mography image most people won't notice three minutes but if you're down for three minutes on on a on a broadcast you're down You've Lost That three minutes it's gone and so what we try to do is we say okay look yeah you might have venue internet you might have venue Wi-Fi let's take the venue ethernet the venue Wi-Fi the guest Wi-Fi let's take four 10 15 5G modems let's take starlink combine them all together and create the most extreme bandwidth and and reliability that we can use every possible internet to make sure that if you're trying to transmit real-time Mission it is going to be achieved in real time for your mission um and that's why the hd4 mbx the epx platform have become an in like almost an industry standard for extreme reliability for our broadcast customers um I we've we've been deploying them all over the country and probably all over the world just for uh other partners um for extreme reliability real-time broadcasts um and so and then peplink has you know we talked about Wan smoothing for our health care forward ER correction has been built for the broadcasters the ability to add par and increase reliability while maximizing bandwidth so once again uh you know it uses less overhead than W smoothing but adds parity to ensure delivery of those packets so when you're transmitting if there's packet loss on those circuits it's going to be received um as a full complete package you know really optimized for that UDP transmission uh for your your video streams and being able to combine um you know integrated you know 10 to 12 5G or or you know external you know way way more um allows you to really have the am of bandwidth you need to to accomplish the mission basically any bandwidth size we can accomplish by mixing these carriers together whether it's you know 4G 5G starlink ethernet WiFi Etc U we're able to combine all those together to create the most possible bandwidth to achieve and and accomplish that mission without and then with Wan smoothing or I'm sorry with Ford error correction and speed Fusion there's zero packet loss so you can lose an internet connection and you're not going to drop those package you're not going to drop the connection and so it's going to you know your real-time transmission your video transmission will stay stable and and that's really what we're bringing to the table when we talk about extreme reliability for broadcast yeah I think the the thing that comes up every time when we talk about broadcast as well what about live you you know and I think to me it's like okay liveu is a kitchen gadget right it does like one thing and it does that thing really well right it's going to mandle in the crap out that that video feed right but it's not going to do all the other things that you need to achieve your mission right it doesn't support the voice Communications applications it doesn't support a remote production engineer getting into this device and changing these settings right it only does accessing your PTZ cameras yeah yeah it it's great at that little thing that it does but it doesn't support the mission it doesn't support the completeness of the mission that these people are tasked with when they go into these areas it just supports piece of their mission and that's what pebbling does so differently well what I find really funny and only because you brought it up I try to keep uh you know uh uh third parties out of it but and since you brought it up I I it surprising me how many customers will actually take their live view and plug it into the peplink yeah you know it's like they'll use it as an encoder but then they use the peplink for the transport yep and because they only have to pay for one set of Transport instead of paying for transport on the derro or the liveu or whatever it is you pay for the trans transport on the pep link it solves the connectivity problem and then they use the live view for encoding um so you're only paying for one data set one one one uh you know one connection set you're not paying for multiple connection sets yep yeah exactly yeah the scale right you you start yeah okay that's cool for this little small thing but now we've got 10 cameras and now we've got a truck and it doesn't hold up when you start throwing more scale at it frankly yeah exactly um so I left I got 10 five five seven minutes here for Q&A um so I'll leave that open there for you I I didn't see do we have the Q&A section because I didn't see I I kind of answered one of them there but um okay not in oh yeah okay but so yeah so if you have any questions for free to ask otherwise I'm going to do a quick just show I mean our webinars we talk about technology but I wanted to kind of showcase a little bit the um like even right now um I just thought it was kind of fun I'm running so my backpack I've got my backpack um and you know if you haven't seen me post all the time on LinkedIn um I have it I'm sitting in my car right now so I don't have my my antennas on the roof I'm not in my RV where I have my hd4 mbx and my starlink and my my antennas I'm in an art I'm in my car and driving up to to Ohio for a project tomorrow and I wanted to make sure this call went well and hopefully it did Travis so hopeing my audio and everything was good and so I wanted to make sure it was well so I actually so I have my my T-Mobile I have my AT&T but my car also has Wi-Fi you know it's my my you know pay like what it's like 200 bucks a year and you get kind of like that Wi-Fi hotspot the kids throw their iPads on and so I have my my Wi-Fi on my on my car and then I have my pixel which also has T-Mobile on it and so I have that and so I'm then bonding all those together with W smoothing so if I go into my remote web admin you can see there's my connection so I'm using my Wi-Fi wan there I've got my my cellular WS I've got my Wi-Fi that I'm connecting to that's what my my is on right now and I got my little Bluetooth my Bluetooth keyboard my Bluetooth mouse my Bluetooth headset and a tablet mounted to my window here um and then if I go to my Advanced speed Fusion there you go so I've got my speed Fusion set up and I've enabled uh Wan smoothing so there's my Wan smoothing right there and so what I'm doing is I'm adding parody bits I'm duplicating packets across those four internet connections so that I'm maximizing the delivery of these packets so if any of those two of those connections could fail and basically you wouldn't even notice on your end receiving this video call and then I have fail over time it's instant right it's instantaneous I'm duplicating the packets then on my outbound policy I have an outbound policy that's enforcing my connection over that speed Fusion tunnel so I wanted to make sure that everything that I'm doing on this tablet it's going over speed Fusion it's connecting back to my SD my epx it's sitting in uh Gainesville Florida with my 3 gigabit fiber line and so I'm sitting it all over there and maximizing the reliability so as I travel around today or this week up in Ohio and traveling up and down I75 I'm taking I'm getting the most reliability and that's what I wanted to guarantee here is reliability and so I've got the br2 with my two hot Wi-Fi um connection giving me four connections total and then I'm I'm W smoothing those with parody um to make sure my team's calls are stable um and so and I am parked and safe uh so I'm I'm not driving right now but the idea is that that these meetings that I can have while I'm traveling stay stable um and and I do this all the time if you've ever hired my company to do an install we typically drive and so I'm in one of either my speed Fusion Vans or one of my cars and I need to be able to have meetings provide tech support and make sure I have webinars like I am now and so I use the same technology that we're talking about to accomplish my mission um and so I just wanted to share that with you and I guess we will see if we have any questions that matter or that sorry sorry that was that came out wrong any questions that I can address so Synergy mode doesn't work with starlink oh you're typing answer sorry so we we have Synergy mode which is the ability to combine pink routers so say if I wanted to have more bandwidth permanently in my backpack I could actually take the the max br1 mini 5G plug it into the W port on my br2 and have three 5G modems on my br2 that's Synergy mode um so Synergy mode combines two peplink routers together to make one super router starlink mode is a separate mode so if I go into the network Tab and I go to WAN I have my Synergy controller my Synergy mode and then I have my starlink mode and actually if you look at my BR my my Rebel so this is my R my RV and currently when I'm not driving by the way I suspend my starlinks one of the nice things about starlink so that's not failed it's just um but so I have start I have Synergy mode enabled or not I'm so sorry I have starlink mode enabled on that Wan and you could see the little SpaceX logo there and if I click details you can actually see my uid you can see my um you can see my obstructions there you go so my time instruction my time instructed my fractional instruct obstructed so I can see details about this Starling dish I can even reboot that dish so I can click reboot hit yes and it will reboot that starlink modem that's on the roof of and this will actually go to no connection here in a second um now right now it's down because I don't I I've suspended the bill I don't don't want to pay for it if I'm not using it but then you can see that I've got my my cellular WS so starlink Wan is different than Synergy mode Synergy mode combines routers starlink mode enables the starlink uh V kind of modem capabilities built into the peplink router they just both came out in the same firmware so it sounds like they're part of the same thing but yeah there is distinctions there yes starlink uh info works on um any 8.4.1 router so if you have a br1 pro 5G um that would it would also provide it you just have your your one W instead of your dual wi see see right there no cable detected so I I clicked that reboot and it rebooted that starlink dish there there yeah we get this question a lot like oh which model do I need to have the starlink capability any model does not matter all peplink hard models with an Ethernet wport support starlink mode it's just you need that firmware eight that has to be able to run 841 okay um well it's one o'clock so thank you so much everybody for joining me on this Mission um transportation and Mobility is um like I said something that's really close to my heart because it's what I do for my job every every day um and so I hope that this uh helps you understand it a little bit better and if you have any questions you can always reach out to Peter atwest networks.com or Travis pink.com and um and we'd be more than happy to uh answer any additional questions as well as provide you with uh partners and resources to help you solve your mission um so thank you so much for joining us today and thank you Travis once again for hosting Peter thank you as always you bring tons of Real World Knowledge to the community so it's always fun all right folks take care have a good one bye bye"}

sudden I know I was over in Australia doing the the PCA training and it just it just imperfectly uh timed up with uh with my session so I apologized for missing last last month and um but at the same time kind of happy to be back to it and it was it was fun to to kind of uh provide that PCA training in Australia so uh yeah so it's kind of a fun sadness but we're back it's all good we got a new face with us too we do have a new face I'm gonna introduce him in a second the uh um th this webinar is an interesting one um this we're gonna talk about event connectivity in this webinar and it's not easy to set up a lab um environment to do my real-time demos so I have brought the best thing I can think of for a lab and that is Adam Stedman um and he runs event Wi-Fi over in Europe and provides large scale events and actually I have referenced him in several of my my videos because of some of the amazing I think it was 190 WS was that right Adam Oh Come it was it was only a 100 WS 100 WS okay but but but bonding 100 WS um and so I I I brag about Adam often when I'm talking about the number of devices we can connect to an epx um and so I'm really excited to bring him in on this and he is my live demo so we're we're gonna talk together about event connectivity and and some of the challenges Associated to it but some of the amazing capabilities that peplink brings to the table um and so um thank you Adam so much uh if you want to give a few seconds just uh about yourself and what you've been doing sure well thank thanks very much for inviting me Peter it's absolutely brilliant to be involved in this little peplink University webinar so yes you're right I'm Adam from event WiFi and there's no prizes for guessing what we do as a business and it's no secret that we absolutely love the peplink ecosystem so I'm very happy to give you some insight into things that we do at event excellent thank you and as always Travis is with us which is always fun to to have uh the the this new Trio here for this webinar um so basically idea is we get told about there's a lot of challenges that are associated to event Wi-Fi um it's not like even what I do Mo with Mobility connectivity it's not the same you have diverse diverse uh topology you have various capabilities for connectivity and mounting you have restrictions on what you might or might not be able to bring into the the venue um so there's a lot of challenges not that are even not mentioned in what we're going to talk about today but one of the biggest challenges if you assume that we're able to deploy a peplink solution or a cellular solution or a sterling solution um would be Associated to um congestion or capacity and there's two areas that that plays in a challenge one you've gotta if you're trying to serve that that the number of people that are using the Wi-Fi but then also they are creating the own their own problem with all their cellular devices so you have like you have this mix of you know 200,000 people in a in an event that are both causing congestion but also trying to access a network so you need a network that can scale to that size um and so the the challenge is a lot more difficult in that scenario and I know I mean what what's the biggest event that you've provided connectivity for Adam I can't possibly tell you that I have to keep some Secrets the thing with high user density is there's two things to consider here one is your incoming internet connection so you're talking there about cellular you're talking about what existing infrastructure is at the venue uh how are we going to make use of those but then you've also got the Wi-Fi side as well and how we actually deliver that connectivity to the end users and it's you can analyze you can always go and do testing you can go testing before but it's never going to be the same when you go to the actual event so there's lots of scenarios you have to play through in your mind to work out what that's going to look like when you get that full density of people there and I've lost Peter back I I there was a complaint about my audio so I was gonna hook up my headset y so so yeah I think being able to plan adequately before you go to an event is absolutely great um and there's another thing as well that you have to take into account is people tend to bring their own devices as well and it's how do you manage people bringing their own Wi-Fi um their own even mobile phones taking into um the connectivity as well one second ad yeah I want to move on but I gotta complain about my audio so I just wanted to connect this headset real fast I apologize I'll let you reconnect yeah give me just one ad I I thought that was interesting that you pinpointed two different aspects of the connectivity and I'm guessing that that influx of users impacts both sides of that connectivity as well absolutely um so then the next challenge is up time and and this one is this one I do have a little bit of experience with because it's why I get called sometimes but it when you're doing you know when you have an office setup or even a mobile Health setup you have protocols in place that might you know hey if my internet drops you know switch to pen and paper or do something like that when we're talking about Live Events and this I mean this even goes to like like Church events and things like that but when you talk about Live Events you can't have a downtime downtime is simply not acceptable there is no backup protocol in most scenarios when you're trying to live stream or when you're trying to host an event where you where content is being delivered and so so it's it's not like oh yeah we'll have a 24-hour response time great then that means The Internet's been been down for 24 hours the event is now over and we lost it all and so having the ability to have basically 100% connectivity is critical uh for event space and um and well for for real-time events yeah single single point of failure is one of my big buzz words I always speak when I look at an event I'm always looking at all the possible single points of failure but you're right an event happens today there is no tomorrow in events if it doesn't work today it's too late exactly it's it's not the same with um the Enterprise world or the corporate world you can always say oh I'll order a part it will come tomorrow but you don't get that luxury with events it has to work now so it's about selecting the right Hardware um to make sure that you eliminate every single single point of failure possible I'm not saying you can eliminate every single point of failure you can always find an edge case but there becomes a point where how much do you spend on a project depending on how much resilience do you need and there'll be a a balance between the two Al Ely yep and I think it's also in that scenario it's also risk risk assessment right if if the percentage of a you know an Enterprise grade piece of equipment failing is you know 0.1 um then you know it's like okay how much do you want to pay to mitigate that risk versus the risk of of a of a Cellular Connection not working or V you know an internet connection that might you know might or might not provide enough bandwidth I I I think um there are scenarios where you can look at the the the cost or the the opportunity of that risk occurring and then the cost to mitigate that risk and we we always going to balance that out absolutely um and then the the third challenge that we we see here is uh you know diverse locations in cellular performance events take place in a variety of locations from Urban centers to remote areas so we need to you know requiring flexible connectivity solutions that that can adapt to different environments and so you know events happen at all over the place and they can happen in a metal building that has virtually no no internet connectivity it could happen you know at a Convention Center where they have you know nice just you know cellular repeaters and amplifiers and you know and so you're you're really dealing with congestion not necessarily signal strength um but the point is they can happen anywhere and so we have to have we have to be able to adapt to those scenarios where what happens if there is no cellular or starlink isn't available or the venue internet is not even I mean it's just not physical Pro you know I once again I I deal with a lot of Church events so you know they'll go out to the field and say hey we want to do an event out in this field and there is no there's no power there's no venue internet there so you're you're basically having to create that infrastructure um live I I do love a challenging location I think probably the one of most exciting ones we did uh was for a music streaming site which was a nuclear bunker uh underground and that is quite a challenge to actually get connectivity uh in a nuclear bunker that's by its design designed not to get any signals inside even through to and there was some aircraft hangers where they developed Concord the other week and they were launching a car inside racing around inside but we always go to a blank canvas and quite often there'll be no infrastructure there already and it's building something from scratch and that's quite exciting with events to be able to do that deliver it and then celebrate that at the end when it actually works well and then for your job it's always different so you get to do this I mean every you know a bunker I mean a bunker the only only I could think is we set up you know what a whole bunch of starlinks and 5gs outside run fiber to idfs inside and then distribute the Wi-Fi network would that be I mean I mean on this on this particular scenario there was a Cellular Tower right on top of the bunker which was in a tower that was originally involved with some project they had going on there so we had all the equipment outside and we were able to aggregate all that cellular uh aggregate all the other connectivity in there and then run it inside the venue on fiber to access points dotted around and what one of the beauties of peplink access points is you can run them on Poe but you can also run them off DC as well so it gives you the ability to be able to run them on battery for example yep and with event you're not looking at being able to have something running all the time your event May only last 12 hours so you can create some very exciting Solutions with the peplink ecosystem so that would be fiber to a trans like a 12vt um fiber to RJ45 transceiver and then DC a just just a little battery there you could do that but you've got the um even the peping switches you can run off DC and those have fi trans receivers on them oh and then you wouldn't yes and then you wouldn't have um Poe when you're doing 12 volt at least so that you would have you just 12 volt right into we can run those switches I think we can run those switches off 12 volts can't we pza you can yeah so you're doing that and you can run the access points off 12 volts and you can run all that off off a little lithium battery dumping those in places so you know there's some interesting Solutions I mean there was that new cable that peplink bought out recently which allows you to power the new microfit device is off a battery M so there's some good there's some good Solutions out there in the ecosystem I like it and and so speaking about solutions that was a perfect segue into to kind of how peplink helps in that scenario but one of the challenges that's not on here that I do want to hit before we do that actually venue cost I I when I when I go to like a trade show I go to like NAB for I don't want to say trade show name I go to a trade show and the V the it's it's like they have this internet there but specifically if if it's a large capacity venue they'll they'll charge you I got a quote $32,000 for 25 megabits per second of internet for three days and that's good that's a good price it's so you go so if I bought an MB x with four 5G cards my Roi is a day and a half and then every future event is then free in its Essence because of the cost of that is that in Europe is in Europe is it similar or are there Europe I mean I won't lie the cost of uh conference venue connectivity is very high I wouldn't say it's quite as high as as um as you've just said there that was probably Vegas or somewhere like that it it was it was in Vegas there you go you know it's it's uh it's yeah it it can be quite expensive but a lot of the venues in the UK and Europe do have probably good enough cellular for what you need on a trade stand because quite often on a trade stand you don't need an awful lot and I mean I wouldn't necessarily for us I wouldn't say the mbx is necessarily our go to product for something like that uh for a trade stand but certainly things like transits I absolutely love for that the br2 is one of our most popular but I mean I am Professor P so I have to have an mbx the br2 is a really good package for doing that and yeah again you've got the party trick quite a lot of those uh conference venues will have Wi-Fi there will have guest Wi-Fi there's nothing to stop you connecting those devices to the guest Wi-Fi doing a bit of speed fusion and connecting that to your cellular as well and you've got three Connections in your dual cellular box now amen okay so now we're going to go into the the official Solutions I just wanted to bring that up because trade show event internet like is ridiculously expensive um and and I think that the solutions that we that we're bringing to the table here you know it it's like the idea of solving that problem but then also potentially been saving a lot of so it's like being able to complete your mission but also saving a lot of money and the you know over the course of even just one or two or or three you know if you do two events a year um as it like for trade shows and boosts and things like that but anyways so when we talk about user density um you know pepling can maximize uh accessible bandwidth by connecting multiple carriers together and so we talk about the ability to use guest guest Wi-Fi cellular satellite and um venue ethernet um if they're going to provide it to you and combining all those together um to create as much capacity as possible but I think when we talk about user density there's also providing Wi-Fi and you mentioned it a few seconds ago but we talked about Distributing Wi-Fi networks so it's one is getting internet through congestion the other is providing internet to a bunch of people um and and you know I know like the the AP1 ax supports you know 256 users but if you have you know 10,000 users are you are you I mean I don't know what the largest you've done is but are you mounting like distributed APS to cover zones of roaming or or how are you handling user do I mean I mean there was there was there was an event we did recently uh which was an old Hall in the UK and we just put multiple access points in there you've got to balance your frequencies up properly we've got different frequencies to play with obviously the 5 gtz is much better than the 2.4 for density and capacity most devices can use five gigahertz now but another trick we use as well when balancing that Wi-Fi if you use the air probe system available with peping I have so this is BR I don't know very many people even use that anymore but a well I absolutely love it so we will take um maybe even some older peplink devices that are still capable of doing uh you know Dual Band Wi-Fi and dump those in strategic places and we can actually then monitor the frequencies and balance up the Network that way as well and that's available I think on every peplink device that has Wi-Fi you can just go into a special setting in there and turn it so you you have air monitor available on all peplink devices that have Wi-Fi but air probe is a special product a that one actually has the Spectrum analysis and things like that whereas air monitor um gives you the ability to monitor like Wi-Fi performance and and you know Rogue APS and things like that air probe is a tool it's a it's an AC basically an AC mini the old AC mini with a spectrum analyzer built into it so it ATT a and it gives you a lot more reporting to it I think you but you can also turn that on on devices like the transit air monitor you can turn on air monit monitor not air probe air air probe and air monitor a little little bit different little bit different but it's it's good it still gives us an awful lot of feedback when we want to balance those yeah things in a high density but the range of Wi-Fi I think is also worth talking about as well because you can't just put one access point in and hope it's going to cover an entire venue and everybody will have a different distance that they want to work with I work with about 25 meters from an access point um before it becomes reliable you can convert that to feet because you know we're Europeans so we're all in meters here um but you have to also accept that one access point could fail so you've got to put your access points in a certain distribution around so if one fails you still got another two that could still cover that area for you definitely uh questions about congestion I think I think we got it so the you know the idea is um but the the point though is is that not only are we trying to address internet capacity under congestion by by by moneti or by by maximizing the opportunity of VAR diverse carriers we also have to pay attention that when we're specifically talking about events not just being a trade show booth we're also trying to provide Wireless to a bunch of people and and so you have two different areas that we're trying to trying to solve when we talk about high density but when we talk about cellular density one of the cool things about peplink when we talk about cellular capacity is and there's kind of a fun little test question that peplink does it's like oh you know if a tower has 100 megabits of throughput and you have 10 people on that Tower each person you know assuming they were using full capacity is going to get you know around 10 megabits of throughput at the same if they're using at the same time and so the idea is if I have if I'm two of those people now I have 20 megabits of available throughput and so when you think about Tower capacity you have a couple different ways to handle that one we have we have we can offer diversity of the carrier itself so I'm connecting to T-Mobile AT&T or what you orange I think is that a isn't orange yeah vone so different you anyways you have different carriers um that you can diversify maximizing Tower access then you can have be multiple people or multiple presence on each carrier and so the ability to have you know we do a lot of work with like T-Mobile um saay right now and events because they're they're doing like their new the some cool 5G Technologies um and so we'll have a T-Mobile band 25 a T-Mobile band 41 a T-Mobile band 71 and so we're we have we have three t-mob all set to different frequencies connecting on at a venue and then we Bond those together so we're create you know and then we'll have you know three you know two or three T-Mobile or AT&T's and two or three Verizon and we're combining all those together to one maximize carrier diversity two make sure we're getting the most bandwidth out of each frequency that those carriers provide and so we're you know we're trying to make sure that there's enough we're we're taking we're we're taking advantage of the the all opportunity for connectivity there is you're you're you're so lucky to be able to test the 5gs system at the moment because it hasn't really we've got O2 that's dabbling in it at the moment in the UK but it's certainly not mainstream and won't be for a while um while we're talking about high user density is it worth talking about traffic shaping and the ability of the um the newer firmware we have another we have another slide for that so we'll talk about traffic shaping yeah we do yeah we'll talk about traffic shaping in a few minutes so it's just more of how we handle high high user density um so I got a whole slide dedicated to traffic shaping little teaser for the future so we talk about constant uptime and um and so pep you know because we can manage multiple internet connections at the same time um not only can we do traffic shaping which we'll talk about but we also have the ability to do hot failover hot failover is different than failover and it's important to understand if I if I'm at a venue and they're giving me a gig by gig circuit and then I have star Linker 5G I might say hey look this gig by gig circuit is enough to accomplish my needs however in the event that that goes down in the event that something happens I need to transition to a bonded 5G or bonded 5G and Starling solution in instantaneously without interrupting the flow of data and so peplink has this ability to wrap that what we call hot failover it's a it's a feature of speed Fusion that basically says hey I'm going to use this this gig I've got my speed Fusion VPN going to my my you know Azure data center wherever and then I'm going to wrap that with my or I'm going to take that dedicated internet that's at the venue I'm going to wrap it with speed Fusion so in the event that that's you know if that's as long as that gig by gig circuit is working that's all I'm going to use never never touch the 5G or the starlink that has higher latency and things like that use that that that gig circuit in the event that goes down the 5G and the starlink are sitting there ready to go and literally the router can just move that traffic almost almost instantaneously to the 5G and Starling service giving what we call Hot fail Rec session persistence over when failure switching between Wan links um this is very very different than having you know some other product that maybe you have your your gig line and then you have your 5G and you go okay in the event that this fails now all my sessions break and it moves over to the 5G and then everything gets reestablished over 5G and so when we talk about needing this ultimate reliability at events hot failover plays a a really large role in that especially if you have good good venue internet that that you're going to take advantage of you know uh for for your capacity and then want to be able to have that resiliency going over to 5G and starlink that's that's really good I mean when you talk about hot failure where what do you think about the drop in mode um as well on devices so we because I'm a peping guy I try to fight against the drop in mode and I know that it makes sense people put in their you know their their third party firewalls and routers and things like that they're going to drop and mode into that and that about gives you the ability to have that hot failover um I I've got a lot of customers that play around with uh other brand systems for their Land network um I primarily focus on peplink in my world so yes drop in mode does play a role when you're trying to integrate with other platforms um but makes configuration very easy because quite often we'll go to a venue and it may have a pre-existing internet connection but by their own admission they'll say it's not good enough for what we need can you do something quickly to Beef It Up and something like droing mode can be very useful for that so you're saying at the venue side adding hot failover to the venues provided internet so they have their own infrastructure in place and they go hey this isn't super reliable so you'll throw you know sdx in drop in mode or whatever with some some 5G or domes or starlink or whatever and increase the resiliency of the venue internet provided to the entire network there you go so they've already got their pre-existing infrastructure they've got everything we can just put a little bit of Kit in there and now we've given you that redundancy that you want because your single point of failure is your fixed line it's brilliant but it's a single point of failure that's a very simple quick easy way to drop a bit of peplink equipment in um to get that resilience uh there's still a fail over time on that still down to health checks and I'd probably say health um health failover is a better it's more it recovers a lot quicker uh if there was an issue but again it comes down to budget and what you're trying to achieve at each venue and what they actually need I like that I I didn't even think about actually working with the venue I'm always trying to fight against the venue they if they if they've got a good line you want to use it definitely yeah that's a that's a a great great use case in design um and then finally uh diverse locations in cellular performance Pink's ecosystem ensures unmatched Network resilience um the the compact devices offer seamless deployment in almost any location I am going to add the almost there um indoors or Outdoors um and we will talk about that in the next slide a little bit with some use cases there but I I I will say that um we've had several customers that will buy the solution for and once again when I think events primarily I'm dealing with trade shows that's why I brought you in here because you do really cool large scale actual events um but we use uh we've had some some incredible use cases where some pretty large companies were tired of paying those trade show fees and so they wanted a robust solution that they could go almost to any event uh location and have connectivity and not pay for the event internet that was their thing like we don't want to pay the trade show internet wherever we go we want to be able to set set a box down turn this thing on and power our booth and we don't want to have to think about the internet solution uh that's that's at we want zero day connectivity um and uh and and so we you know we taking advantage of high performance antennas taking advantage of multi-cellular diversity um even using like starlink in some really rural areas the the complete ecosystem integration of of cellular and starlink and WiFi and ethernet allows you to basically take these devices anywhere turn them on and basically connect to anything you want I've even had people tether their cell phones to on the ethernet ports and provide even more bandwidth um you know they like maybe they have like the Samsung s24 and they'll have that millimeter wave and so they'll plug it in and you know have a you know a millimeter Wave Internet circuit um at some some locations and so the ability to basically connect any internet possible into these devices and then make the most use of them and you know provides incredible robustness you know kind of almost anywhere you go yeah I I agree with you and they're they're just so adaptable there's so many different types of connections that you can put into these devices the connections you can use are changing all the time you know you mentioned starlink there we wouldn't have been speaking about starlink a couple of years ago you know there's other projects coming out which are using low earth orbits there's midar orbit there's there'll probably be some other clever um connectivity coming out soon but peper Link's pretty future proof and looking forward very forward thinking to actually roll up those into their single package um you're talking about trade shows I'm going to mention a trade show we're doing as we speak where about we've got a load of dual cellular modems all up in the mares all around the venue and it is just purely running off jeel cellular peplink routers everywhere and that's providing enough capacity for um the whole thing it's in the middle of Scotland somewhere absolutely brilliant and we're quite lucky that there's two cell towers really nearby so we're getting really good bandwidth from those cell towers and cell data is charged very differently in the UK to the states I know we get gigabytes of data for next to nothing where that's I know the data can be quite expensive in the States but there's certain trade stands there as well that want to have their own dedicated connection so we'll give them their own private peplink bit of kit so that's their dedicated connection using their cell and then everybody else in the guest Wi-Fi are using this big array of um peplink dual cellular modems instead and how are you creating the array of dual cellular modems are are you using speed Fusion doing like Layer Two or are you synergizing like we uh we we're doing a layer two Network across there they've got a captive portal so they can all log on but of course you've got in control and in control lets you manage all of that manages all your frequencies um you're just treating it as a very exciting access point that's a totally modular system and if a device has an issue and there's no internet connection it'll drop it out of the array anyway because there's no internet connection it just takes that Wi-Fi out until it's recovered and brings the Wi-Fi back in again so there's ways to build really exciting networks in lots of different ways um based upon the tools that peplink give you in their device that's genius I like it so and hence why we brought in Adam question for both of you guys and I think this slide kind of Segways nicely but you know given all the different connectivity options there are today with all the different 5G providers starlink H how do you guys start to calculate that when you look at each event and Peter again this goes to you as well like where does that where's that line drawn in terms of like I need this many 5gs I need this many starlinks how do you start to evaluate that what you would use in different scenarios yeah I mean for me I I the first thing I do is ask what the mission is it's a little little 10 by10 booth where you're trying to get on the internet just check you know have people register a form or stream a YouTube video things like that or are you trying to do some live streaming with you know four five 10 80P streams or you know so the first thing I ask is what's the mission I don't the a lot of people come to me go what's the maximum what's the maximum like if I tell you the maximum you're going to be disappointed and and then it'll be failed for me and it failed for you so I try to avoid with maximums and go by what is your mission what are you trying to accomplish then from there I try to set the expectation based on the average the average capacity of each carrier not the maximum capacity of each carrier understanding that obviously it can range from zero right I mean no no service all the way to several hundred megabits and so the idea is what what is our average capacity or capability what should we expect in general um and so you know say 80% of the time on AT&T you're going to receive you know I'm making this up by the way you know 25 megabits of threp you know and so we're gonna um and so it's like is that good for you and so is that make meet your mission for example and so that's a lot of times that's how I decide what level of connectivity the person might need is you know what do we have access to how can we op maximize our opportunity um and then and what is the what is what is the most robust solution to accomplish the mission and then I kind of double it I'll make because it's always there's always variables that kick in so you know if they go you know if a single single 5G might almost always M meet it I'm G say hey why don't we go with dual 5G and just add that layer of protection if a dual 5G Works hey Let's do let's do Let's do let's add a Max adapter let's just add one additional just to give us a tiny bit of of of variable you know uh contingency in a sense um and so because once again when we're talking about Live Events and venues failure is not an option we we can't so we got to meet the budget that the customer has but at the same time understanding we need to make sure that that I don't want you to come back to me and go this thing sucked right that's not an option for me and and so as much as I want to meet the budget I also got to make sure that I'm guaranteeing the mission and so that those are that's sort of how I how I play in that world and that's the how I choose which router I recommend yeah I think a lot of it is about educating the customer and I think there's been in the past a lot of people had a bad experience with Wi-Fi and event Wi-Fi and it hasn't worked and there's been problems so it is about setting those expectation levels and understanding exactly what they need and they'll come with unrealistic things saying we're doing a live stream in full HD we need 100 megabits a second and we're saying well you don't the time we've got you encoders you need five to six megabits a second so we'll look at the different types of traffic that they're doing on an event we might set up multiple networks so we could have an mbx that handles the uh live stream side we could have some br2s that's handling the production Wi-Fi side and we could have some sdx with some access points that are then handling the public Wi-Fi VIP Wi-Fi guest Wi-Fi that kind of thing so it may not be one solution fits all but you've got to look at what their requirement is and making sure that you're putting in the right Hardware to meet each of those individual requirements that's interesting it sounds like you it's not always just a big monolithic Network right you've got all these kind of little segmented networks sometimes that sounds like in your deployments as well depending on where people AB I I know I'm famous for creating this 1001 connection but there is no use case for having a 100 WS on one epx um but there you go it's h there's a point where it just gets silly but silly is sometimes fun it's it was very fun and there's and there's there's a new challenge coming soon so watch this face uh in about a month's time there'll be a version to I'll be I'll be eagerly waiting the and actually you brought us right into the next topic Adam uh with u picking the hardware and we kind of like you know just in the essence of being able to share kind of threw together four kind of sample Solutions or sample packages where we're showing the the kind of the opportunity or the capabilities that that these that that you could build with a peping solution and and so you know the the obviously the my my my favorite is diversity so uh you know on the smallest scale you could do a transit or br1 um but but really when we talk about you meeting the needs of density diversity um scale you know I kind of wanted to start this at the br2 because this lets us have two car two 5G carriers and and really the USB gives us a third potential you know tether or millimeter wave solution as well um it gives and then we have dual ethernet so you have the ability to have starlink or venue ethernet connected to this as well as dual Wi-Fi Wan 2.4 and 5 gigahertz and then it has its own Wi-Fi Lan um uh capabilities as well and so when you look at like the br2 as a as a small scale um like and and once again I can't think of this is more of a small event or a trade show um but we have this br2 solution that has incredible robustness one of the things I do want to say is when you're sharing W and land you are sacrificing some performance if the radio is connecting to a Wan and then handing off a lan that that radio is doing two tasks and it's being shared and so you should assume that 50% of your capacity is being split between Wan and L so a lot of times I I'll recommend to people use the 2.4 GHz and connect to the L the WAN and then broadcast to 5 GHz for your smaller area that you're trying to connect to um that way the 2.4 gigahertz is dedicated frequency the performance of that is dedicated to to WAN and then on the Lan we have our five gigahertz um and or vice versa whatever whatever works for for you um and then and I um I'm G to put in mine and then I'll let you then comment on these uh as well Adam but uh and then going up into more of the mid scale the idea with the hd4 mbx having four 5G modems this is our for me this is the most popular router we've ever sold um starting with the hd4 LTE going into the hd4 mvx LTE and now the hd4 mbx 5gn with the new x62 chipset sa capabilities um the the product has has stood the test of time it's proven successful over and over and over again and and so a lot of times I'll say you know where the br2 might work you know 90% of the time the the hd4 mbx is going to work you know maybe that 99% of the time is that 1% where you're in the middle of a a field with nothing assuming there's no starlink um you know and you you know you just literally there's no connectivity so it doesn't nothing would work um but but having um you know the dedicated dual rate modems uh dual Wi-Fi modems three ethernet WS um two USB W so once again plugging in those millimeter wave adapters or your cell phones or something like that four built-in 5gn modems Poe so you can extend Wi-Fi and I'm kind of merging these two here but you can add you know Wi-Fi access points via Poe to this you can then connect to the venue ethernet um so it's like the mbx platform gives you the ability to have you know three starlinks four 5G modems venue ether uh venue Wi-Fi and eight Poe plus ports for Wi-Fi devices cameras Etc um making it an incredibly robust uh midscale midsize event capability and I believe the the mbx supports 500 users um so we're talking about event user capacity um and then we're going to go to the sdx sdx pro um supporting you know 12 and 24 gigabits of of stateful throughput um having a a and I've actually put 16 domes on one sdx pro before so um up to 16 domes and I'll talk about what what those makes those really neat um starlink venue ethernet and then having you know especially if you go down to like a switch with the 10 gigabit uh sfps um being able to have you know you know up to 2,000 users on an sdx Network or being able to combine a whole bunch of internet connections the domes particularly are really cool sometimes you're in a venue where you have um there's no cellular inside you want to take advantage of the the the 5G or the cellular but there's just you're not getting that inside so you can run ethernet you know Ethernet or Fiber go outside have a switch or just run the the ethernet up to 300 feet plug the domes outside have your router inside and extend the infrastructure um and Ma maximizing 5G capability so if you need those in that that Cellular Connection outside but having the router and the infrastructure inside you can use the domes to do that um and it's a great way to extend the infrastructure and if you're doing starlink as well you'd have like you know two or three starlinks outside three or four domes outside and then bonding all of that together um to create an incredibly reliable high performance Network okay I'll let you throw in your two cents uh Adam oh you ready yeah br2 I'm I'm with you br2 Pro is such a powerhouse it's such a diverse Beast the amount it can do is just amazing especially when you look at the price point as well very very powerful solution I also love the fact you can power it off Poe as well so that gives you the dual power option on there um the mbx isn't as popular in in the UK and Europe um we like the nbx for live broadcast I think it's absolutely brilliant for live stream live broadcast things like that but the biggest failure um in the UK I would say is cellular signal and things like that so to have that device inside at a venue and then being able to get the cellular signal from outside can sometimes be a challenge so you end up putting High Gain antennas and things like that on it so it doesn't necessarily make sense in the kind of oldie buildings that we have in the UK you know you you know we all have castles and drink tea and everything so you know it's it's it can be a all the sdx with you totally I think this is a brilliant one for large scale events the fact you can put these domes outside because those um you can get a module can't you that goes in there that gives Poe out and the sdx lets you have one Bank of eight and the sdx pro lets you have two Banks of eight so that's what you get your 16 domes outside from of course you got the Dome Duo now so well you have the Dome duo we don't do you not have the Dome Duo yet oh have you got the um the the long range Dome as well I have the long range so we get the we get the the Dome up the long range but but um I do have a dome Duo I'm actually making a video on it but it it's it's European only right now is brilliant especially with that new um Mo yeah the new modem that you're talking about which you know not only lets you Bond um the 5 GSA connections but does carry aggregation the high frequencies and low frequencies so we get more capacity um but yeah I I like that and again I'm looking at single points of failure so would I have one sdx or would I have two sdx because what happens if that sdx fails you need to be able to use both so exactly but it all comes down to cost you've got to look at what your individual scenario is and what makes sense one and technically you could buy two sdx for cheaper than an MPX so on there which is another party trick um High availability drop in yeah I like I I do like the sdx and I also like the fact you can side side load um virtual machines on there as well and other things so what kind of sofware do you run on that uh not peplink software be quiet um we we we used to run a little OS on there which let us do the traffic shaping which is why I was speaking about traffic shaping earlier because sometimes we wanted to restrict how much speed a certain VLAN had or how much connected speed as something else had and the peplink initially could only do three different rules for traffic shaping I think that's 10 rolles now has hasn't it yeah we have 10 rolls now with 8.4 firmware we we have 10 now and there's nothing I mean 10 rules is a lot for an event and that pretty much covers off all the scenarios that you would want so that's been a bit of a game changer for us so we're not sideloading um a different firmware on there to manage that anymore and you know we imp we actually implemented that for the uh you know for the cruise ship industry there was a a major demand for being able to manage I mean internet I out at Sea is incredibly challenging uh and so we needed to be able to to have more than three role groups to be able to you to for the different performance areas that each you know crew and staff and kind of the free Wii and the you know the expensive you know different tiers of Wi-Fi that they wanted to be able to provide and so we needed we needed more than 10 roles there to be able to do that um and even though other other verticals have asked for it like many times over the last over the years it finally took the Cru the cruise industry to to Really push it where it's like like it was like this is like a hard you know requirement that we have to have more than three roles to to be able to manage that that's well we thank them for that that's brilliant exactly um and then kind of kind of going in uh we wanted I wanted to talk about load balancing and bonding and when to use them but but also traffic shaping and so you know peplink it's a common uh question that we get is you know oh I'm bonding but it's not working well did you set it up and so that goes into what what Adam was talking about with traffic shaping and so peplink uses outbound policies if you think the word traffic shaping or traffic control we we call that outbound policies and it's important that with any solution you're you're making sure that the policies are set up to use the solution um the default solution is just just you know kind of Pink's Auto algorithm which is going to load balance the best it can across all your circuits that doesn't necessarily mean it's the right solution for your needs and so we have load balancing and bonding and then we have traffic shap and and qos and things like that we probably don't have enough time I think um uh five or six months ago we had an outbound policy a dedicated s uh video just on outbound policies um so if you go back to the peplink university um library on peplink but the um but I do want to hit up load bouncing bonding as it as it relates to events because it matters especially when we talk about density if you have you know three or four thousand people trying to share internet and we take the fact that bonding has an 18% overhead you you actually aren't maximizing the total capacity by bonding all traffic for from for hundreds or thousands of users over that tunnel sometimes it's best to let them use each internet circuit to the to its fullest and then bonding and adding qos to critical applications like your live stream or you know your messaging protocols teams and zoom and things like that um and so the idea is you Bond the critical infrastructure the critical applications and then you load balance so split Tunnel right we load balance the regular internet traffic so if someone's swiping through Instagram hey if that's going to go on cellular one and then the next time they load a picture it's gonna be that's GNA be strung on cellular 2 or starlink one then starlink 2 and then you know vent Wi-Fi or vent internet you know you don't need to have three gigabits of throughput for someone to scroll their Instagram feed right they just need to be able to query that and then load it fast and so the idea is by using load balancing you can handle a lot of sessions distributed nicely over all available internet connections but then you want to make sure that hey FaceTime and zoom and teams and you know my live streaming application those get bonded and they take they they they Traverse all of the internet connections to make sure that those packets get delivered well and efficiently and then maintain a nice experience for the end user yeah I think I think when we're looking at events you're right there's two different types of traffic on events the stuff which is absolute critical and must work so we're talking about things like live streaming we're talking about payment gateways because a lot of events now have cashless payments and those payments have to be taken that's how they're going to make money on the bar make money on the food stores and things like that you've got ticket scanning so these are getting people into your Venue that's got to work so all those kinds of traffic should be using some kind of bonding technology to make sure that packet of data gets through um reliably but then when you're there you're then looking at giving higher capacities of data which may not be as critical you know the fact that your Facebook page might take a few seconds to upload a photo or something doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things and that's where we look at LAD balancing that kind of connectivity and making good use of that but there's nothing to stop you switching partway through an event as well so it could be as I said you might be scanning everybody in on your bonded connection you might be doing a live stream that then finishes we can then feed what we're doing with there back into the main mix back into that load bonds uh load balancing uh to give you that more capacity again and there's plenty of algorithms in the load balancing okay and it depends on what your scenario is whether you're trying to split the traffic whether you're trying to have lowest latency but that's all built into those rules and you can choose what you want to do but it is understanding again what those requirements is for that event and what the customer actually needs and helping them through that journey to make sure that we build that network uh to their needs I think one thing that's really struck me as you two have talked through this conversation is this concept of risk management and single points of failure and you guys have stepped through how you apply that in a lot of different ways right on the WAN side there's you know risks and different tradeoffs there just on the hardware side but I think what you guys are talking about right now is actually applying that same process to the specific types of traffic that the users are going to be engaging in and applying that same risk management perspective there and um I think that speaks that that's a unique aspect that you don't really hear about when you look at event Wi-Fi right and so um it's interesting you guys are taking that engineering to I think a whole another level that most providers don't really look at it's just do I have my internet connction and I have my Wi-Fi there and yeah there's there's a whole another layer that needs to be addressed it sounds like absolutely we can't we can't just turn it off and back on again at events i' I've had a few questions about firewalls so I'm GNA answer those real fast even sort of off topic um pep I do have an entire webinar just on firewall and we have another webinar just on outbound policies so if you want to learn about those I highly advise you go to youtube.com/ peplink and go to peplink university and and watch the outbound policy or the traffic shaping uh webinar as well as the um firewall webinar because that'll answer a lot of your questions Associated to um linkx firewall capabilities um and what we what we offer there's too much there to try to unpack during this event but I I high advise that you go watch those those videos so I just wanted to address that because we had a couple people talk about it I want to put one question back to both of you and I think you guys have touched on it a little bit but um you know Adam as you described there's the WAN side and then there's the Wi-Fi side and I think the pep Pink's value proposition on the WAN side is basically obvious right we're the only ones that do speed Fusion bonding Technologies all the 5G and the starlink integration there's so many different things that we can talk about on the WAN side that makes peplink the obvious choice there but you two are both very sophisticated Network engineers and have a long career in the field and you're both choosing peplink on the Wi-Fi side as well and I think that one's pretty interesting because on the surface Wi-Fi is kind of a commodity thing right lots of companies make Wi-Fi access points there's more popular choices for Wi-Fi um and you folks obviously have the choice to choose those as well but you're choosing pep and you're doing that for a reason and so I'm curious if you can just more focused dig into why you're choosing pep for the Wi-Fi side of this for these large scale critical high density events for I can say for for me um it's it's it's I'm addicted to the ecosystem uh Travis I peplink has done an amazing job making it so that I can manage tens of thousands of customers from my cell phone and and that's is so critically important for for my scale for user experience and for for deploying just you know the the the number of networks that that we are that we're now deploying on a on a weekly basis this at at this point um and so it's like there are lots of Wi-Fi Solutions there's lots of land Solutions there's there's I mean I got people that are using different land switches and different land Wi-Fi networks and they're they're going to stand by those they're hardcore and I and I support that you know you want to throw whatever brand it is that you want to throw in the network that's fine I'm going to work with you we can do OSF bgp we can static route to you we could just trunk uh vlans down to you so we can work with any solution however when we talk about peplink and in control and the ability to go okay I need to create an SSID that's a guest Network that that reroutes a captive portal that's on VLAN 66 that trunks down through seven switches and I go okay add VLAN 66 apply this to the switches and the router and then when I add that VLAN make it this IP address and have the DHCP scope to be this dhp scope I hit save and apply and in control and that gets pushed out to all the switches in the network as well as the router then I go to the SSID and I say create this wi-fi network and have it go on VLAN 66 and I'm done I just programmed a Wi-Fi network on 800 APS to Traverse six different switches or that that many APS so 20 different switches and it worked in in a matter of milliseconds it's like boom done and and so for me I will trade off some of those arguably better features which once again I'm G say arguably better features in exchange for that unified ecosystem to be able to manage just the the number of devices and user scenarios that we handle every single day um and so and and then not to mention the support there's a lot of guys out there that will complain you know talk about other brands but I've I mean the ability to just call you up and say hey Travis I got a question how have you ever done this or or reach out to like the partner Network and be able to get support be having people like Adam and Martin langd and you know these amazing people that are providing incredible Insight all over the world and so we have amazing support and unified ecosystem and I I I I'm addicted to that to that package uh and then and then it performs well the Wi-Fi 6 products and and the poe products the switches they perform well so you're it's you're not sacrificing performance um for it and I get ecosystem and support so you know for me like that total package that just is such a lifesaver for my for our growth I couldn't put it better myself really Peter you're quite right the the most important thing that peplink has is in control and for us from a support side it means that everyone in my organization works the same everyone in peplink works the same it's really easy to support it even goes down to the point I can give my customers access to in control as well and they can manage certain things themselves it fors us all to use peplink in a very similar sort of way which you don't get with the ecosystems everyone's got their own way of doing stuff and it it's kind be hard to work out how to change this and how to do this but peper link makes it all very easy um from that simple in control interface I think that's you know sometimes it's the simplest things and like Peter you said just pushing out an SSID when you've got let's just say eight different models of peplink equipment out there between br2 pros and Wi-Fi access points to just create one simp Le policy and configure all those different types of devices that that's unique that that's actually very uncommon to find usually vendors all like one model at a time and it the that that zero touch provisioning concept falls apart quickly when you actually go to deploy it in real world scenarios but yeah it's interesting to see both of you folks coming to that conclusion and you know in in scenarios where the performance really does matter too right so yeah it's cool to hear that at my house I have an AP1 rugged in my garage I have ax AP1 AXS um downstairs and upstairs and then I have Flex APS mounted to trees um kind of covering my backyard and three of them two of them are running different firmware because they're older Hardware but it serves the purpose I don't I I you know it's fine and know AC Wi-Fi out you know covering the land is fine and the and I can program my SSID set up my fast transition and I you know if we have an event like sometimes we'll host events at our house I can s create a guest Network put a little Capt portal with the event logo boom done and the the Network's now operating with that with that and we you know share it out with a little QR code or whatever and people can scan and join in and and so like and you're right it it doesn't matter like I it can it it doesn't have to be the same device deves I could just zero touch that entire SSID solution with the vlans and the Capt portals and everything instantaneously and it's so powerful so and I I think we're at time I I try to address most questions um yeah so so if you go to youtube.com peplink and then there's a peplink university playlist um and then also uh youtube.com westworks LLC we have a peplink university playlist that has additional content um outside of just the webinars um so if you're looking for peplink University content um there you can kind of go to both uh locations um and then Travis thanks for the questions Adam I'm so grateful you took out I mean I know it's after hours for you uh thank you so much for for taking time out of your day to attend this and be my live demo um because I didn't know how to demo this and uh you you joined at last minute I I'm very appreciative for your time and knowledge absolute pleasure Peter anytime yes thank you Adam thank you Peter and thank you everybody for joining us this is another great webinar and looking forward to the next one here and if you have any suggestions on webinar topics please email uh Travis pink.com or Peter West networks.com if you have additional questions you can also reach out to either one of us and we'll get you in contact with whoever it is um so it doesn't matter which region you're in we can get you con connected to the right partner at the right at the right region um and get you those answers um those questions answered so if we did not answer your question please reach out let us know we'll get you with to the right answers so thank and thank you Travis always for hosting absolutely all right

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "cool folks we got a lot of people here thanks again for showing up joining us we've got as always Professor P Peter West here and we're today talking about speed Fusion tunnels and configuring them in all the little nitty-gritty details you can find in there so Peter this is one that I think people get lost pretty quick in when you start looking at all the different options and how to actually use these effectively so I think this is one of those one of those topics that we just can't talk about enough really and so I think a great great suggestion for today I'll hand it over to you to dive in yeah thank you and and I agree there is there is um uh can you hear that train or is that just me I can hear the train but it's not over okay I apologize okay I apologize um so uh this is a topic that has brought up a lot and I think there's a lot of confusion around speed fusion and I kind of wanted to open up that conversation a little bit and we've had lots of different discussions about configuring speed Fusion we just had the PCA so if you were on the PCA we talked about speed Fusion but I still get a lot of questions about speed Fusion sometimes we'll call things you know like the fusion Hub the speed Fusion Hub or or you know we think of it as a as as a as the ability to bond on an individual router and so I thought it'd be really nice to just have a video about speed fusion um and and really just talk about how it works what what's needed to make it work and the different solutions we have to provide it and then more importantly what makes us competitively advantageous with speed Fusion for the salespeople in mind um speed Fusion is a tunnel bonded VPN technology allows you to aggregate multiple internet connections together to create a session persistent and reliable VPN connection between two endpoints boom that's speed that's speed Fusion we don't have to watch anymore right we just gave it away um speed Fusion is a VPN at its Core Essence that's what it is it's a VPN between two peplink endpoints now what speed Fusion does above any other VPN is it allows you to have our speed Fusion Technologies part of it but in order to achieve speed Fusion we we we recommend we actually it's not a requirement we recommend in control 2 and we recommend or there is a minimum of firmware of 6.1 uh which is when speed Fusion was originally released which is a long long time ago what's really cool about speed fusion though is it's a secure and seamless VPN solution this means that we're talking AES 256bit 4096 DH encrypted tunnels but then those tunnels are broken up across all of your Wan circuits so if you have four 5G modems and two cable modems or two isps in your data center that is eight separate 256 six bit encrypted tunnels it so it makes it's incredibly secure but but then it's so easy sometimes it doesn't feel like it's secure because I'll show you how easy using in control 2 it is to deploy speed Fusion we also are not uh the the end points can be behind a cgnat or even a natat or your personal Network um and so what's really nice about speed Fusion is only one side we call we're going to call that the Hub from now on right the Hub site has to have public IP addresses or public facing IP addresses they don't even have to have public IP addresses they just need to have publicly accessible addresses and then and so and all the peer sites they don't need any public IP addresses or even publicly accessible IP addresses they could be behind a natat or cgnat behind uh AT&T and Verizon and T-Mobile's private uh IP ranges and and that's what's so cool about this you can create tunnels between your your your main facility your your Hub and your peers without the need of of public IP addresses at the peers this is a phone home technology um and and that's also makes peplink incredibly usable in today's world if you especially think we talk about starlink with the private IP addresses and um even isps not wanting to give out public IP addresses readily cable modems and those you know things like that I mean even the AT&T FiOS at our office that we use in our lab has just a an added IP address and then we can do the vnet things like that hand off one one public for that but but for the most part isps are getting more and more reluctant to hand out public IPS and so we want to be able to work with that and with peplink speed Fusion VPN you can do that yeah I think it's got this really neat quality to it that it's easier to set up than something like IP but its capabilities are so much greater than ipse so it's easier and it's just way more powerful at the same time and so yeah it's um you know that that ease of use is actually makes it a lot more realistic and and financially feasible to deploy too like you said if you don't have to pay for static IPS on those um carrier 5G networks that's savings and that makes it just easier to deploy and easier to shift so looks like you're going to dive into some fun details here though yeah so I figured the first thing to do and I tell my yes that was legitimate train um so I I figured the best thing to do is actually dive into a VI and and and explain it because just showing you in in the router how speed Fusion works or on a on a uh doesn't explain why it works so I'm going to open up a new tab here we're going to create a new one here I'm going to grab my sdx router which is what I'm going to be using in my demos so we're going to grab our sdx router now this is sitting in my data center um and if I go to here this is my public IP address so I'm going to go and copy and paste that into our Vio so this is our our public IP address so this is that that this is my Hub and this is my public IP now let's say I had a firewall let's say you go man that would be super nice but my Corporation would never let me pug a peplink router into your into your into my corporate network no problem you could also natat this and do port forwarding so you could assign this a DMZ IP address 17216 2542 and a default gateway of. one then do port forwarding or NP mapping from the public to the private behind another firewall and actually if you look at this drawing right here nope that's a lie if you look at this drawing right I'm sorry I have lab there we go this is exactly what I'm explaining here so we bring in these ports inbound and these are outbound firewall ports so I'm going to copy this so you know in what we're talking about uh what we're going to be doing but you can actually plug this right behind an existing firewall if your corporation or your corporate policies require that you have a public firewall and these are the firewall ports needed to make in everything work um so but I own my own network and I have a public IP address so so here's my sdx with my public IP this is g to be my Hub site once I've done this the sdx supports 200 remote peers so I could have 200 peplink routers in in the uh through plugged into this router into the sdx so I have in my demo we're going to have a Transit there we go transit Duo there it is so we're GNA have a Transit Duo this is going to be our our my remote router this is actually sitting in the Patriot with me right now I'm not using it for internet so that I could give you this demo and then it I actually have a starlink so we're going to pull up a starlink I have the starlink flat high performance mounted to the roof of my Patriot I then have the starlink power supply and then I have two 4G the transit Duo is 4G so I have two 4G internet connections so I've got uh T-mobile and Verizon and so these are my my two internet connections um so I've got my T-Mobile My Verizon and my starlink and then I've got my my starlink uh power supply here so and and if you're not familiar with this the power supply has a little cable that goes to the roof and plugs into my my uh antenna there then a power supply goes into the wall this guy has a power supply that goes into the wall and then there's an ethernet cable that plugs in to my Wan and then I have antennas that go to the roof for my Verizon and my T-Mobile and that is my literally in my RV right now is what I'm using for this demo um and then I have my sdx router over here this Hub router and I it has public IP now my guys at the office went ah had programmed that for me so I could bring it online so I could show you now the reason why I did this is there's a couple ways to bond one is a traditional VPN where I would do a layer three Network so in other words if I wanted this Transit router to access servers or Services sitting inside of my my office like say I had an active directory controller or a Nas so I have a Nas and this Nas is 192.168 1.10 and my router here is 192.168 do oh I'm doing an enter instead of a DOT I apologize 16811 do1 168 do 1.10 let's just pretend I had a Nas and if I wanted my remote sites to be able to access that natat they need to have layer three access they need be routable to each other so this Transit doe up here has to have a different subnet than the network in my HD in my sdx my corporate office so for the purpose of this is 192.168 .124 and that's just the default IP address that comes with a Transit so that's fine and these don't conflict and the reason this is important is if you go to set up a speed fusion and it goes connecting updating routes then goes back to starting that means there's an IP conflict on the untagged land so in other words my management Network my my untagged network depending on if you're a Cisco guy or not this this untagged default Network that peplink has if they conflict you're not going to be able to establish a a VPN and it'll go starting authenticating updating routes starting and that's because these two rout ERS are conflicting in their in their Network there's two ways around this one change the remote Network to make sure it doesn't conflict 19216 850 the other option that peplink has is we can do something called natat mode natat mode takes this router makes the VPN connection a single IP address using DHCP of the sdx this allows me you guys are going to hear a training let me shut this see if I can make a little bit quieter um the um so this allows the um as many transits as I wanted to to have all the same IP address 192168 50.1 and not conflict with each other because they're being maded so West networks one of the things that we do is we have like a a little speed Fusion server that we let our customers sometimes tap into and demos and we test speed Fusion we enable nading on that so that it will actually Bond it won't conflict with any networks and they can test bonding without messing up the network um and so so nading is one way to do it and the other way is layer three I if you're trying to interact with your network like I said your Nas or you want to be able to talk two-way back and forth you want to make sure that your network is layer three which means they don't conflict once we have this set up then we can create the speed Fusion tunnel so I can create a speed Fusion tunnel between these two routers and I can do this in in in in control or I can do this manually so I'm going to show you how to do this manually first and then we're going to delete it and then show you how to how to do it in um in control now the other thing that we want to do is we want to demonstrate a couple different Technologies speed Fusion has bonding we will refer that as dwb it has Wan smoothing and we have FEC so if I wanted to make a speed Fusion tunnel that demonstrated all three of these so I could use outbound policies to use different Technologies based on my needs I could actually create something called a sub tunnel and sub tunnels allow you to create up to five sub tunnels per speed Fusion uh Network so once we do that I can go back into my my router here's my two routers right here so I'm going to open up my sdx and my Patriot router in the sdx I'm going to go to settings remote web admin and in The Patriot I'm going to go to settings remote web admin so in the the the set in the main router my sdx I need to give it a local ID so we're going to set our local ID local ID to sdx HQ okay and then here I want to make my local [Music] ID Patriot uh in FYI this is not political this is uh simply it is an American coach Patriot SUV uh Sprinter and that's why I called it the speed Fusion Patriot or the Rebel or the Renegade it's just the name of the RV so just throwing that out there okay so we're going to go to Advanced and right here is my local ID so I'm going to go sdx HQ it hit save and now I can create a new profile so I can hit new profile and I can say uh Transit Duos I can even enable or disable encryption so if I'm using this for just maximum bonding throughput and I'm not passing PCI or or secure information I can turn this off if you think about this going out to the internet you plug it your C modem into your router you don't have a encrypted tunnel there that's just internet if you're just using this for internet you can save yourself 5% of overhead and turn off encryption so here I can do my remote remote ID my remote ID remote ID is going to be Patriot and I can add multiple remote IDs here if I wanted to so if I had the rebel and if I had the Renegade I could have all three of my sprinters right here on one profile and I could just call this sprinters if I wanted to and literally list the remote ID have a separate pre-shared key right here so I could put in a pre-shared key that they both have to have I can also allow shared remote IDs if I do allow shared remote IDs this would allow multiple devices with the same ID of patriot to connect in so I could say if if I just wanted to have a bunch of sites quickly set up with the exact same profile settings I could lit literally say speed fusion and hit shared ID put a pre-shared key in there and be done with it if I wanted to Gat these devices I could click Gat and ask you where you want to give IP if I check this Gat when the when the transit connects in it's going to say nated and it's going to give me an IP address on the sdx 192.168.1.10 or whatever the next DHCP available is turn that off I can assign a cost to this this is be for OPF I can assign a data Port so if 4500 and 32015 aren't available or aren't usable I could actually go to custom and make this 443 if I wanted to be careful when you're doing that but I could I can also click this question mark click here to configure stream protocol and I can change this from UDP to TCP I've had instances where carriers will throttle or having issues with UDP we switch it to TCP and it improves the throughput dramatic atically there is a cost to that because it retransmits a lot if you're having packet loss or or retransmits on your network sometimes TCP can can not won't be as fast as UDP but in the event that UDP is being throttled TCP is a great way to do this but now if you think about this if I'm creating a tunnel on TCP 443 most like Hotel firewalls airport firewalls Etc aren't going to block it the other thing you could do is UDP 53 right almost nobody blocks DNS so you can actually customize these ports as you see fit um just be aware that it might act weird and you don't want to make you want to make sure your Hub router isn't acting as a DNS or web server on 443 so I'm going to hit allow I'm going to go back to UDP Auto and UDP because that's fine for me here you can set up a bandwidth limit so I can actually throttle the specific tunnel so I can make this tunnel limited to 10 Megs up by 10 Meg down this is really good if you have say you're connecting to T-Mobile 5G getting 500 or 600 megabits of internet and you don't want to suck through all of your bandwidth um and so you want to limit yourself to 30 or 40 megabits per second so that way they get enough bandwidth to do their jobs but they're not sucking up all of your bandwidth U your gigabytes that you that you would have for the month so you can actually throttle the tunnel as you see fit um TCP ramp up this is a really cool technology that if you see when I turn this on it it turns off land smoothing TCP ramp up enables when smoothing for TCP sessions for the first five seconds what it does is basically says hey I'm gonna accelerate the utilization the packet delivery of TCP sessions um and by by enabling W smoothing and then it's going to turn off W smoothing and allow that to go faster through it's basically a way of ramping up TCP sessions sessions so that they can take the most ad um advantage of a of a circuit possible W smoothing uh is our parody bit um so it's it's uh which we'll probably have a slide on this but W smoothing enables parody bits uh by almost like a raid array if if you're familiar with that it's going to duplicate packets over multiple land circuits which will which will eliminate spikes and Jitter and latency so the idea is reducing latency and reducing Jitter by dropping High Laten High latency and high Jitter circuits um and so if you have packet loss or Jitter or latency on your path on one of your isps they simply be ignored because double the DAT packets are being sent if you do way smoothing it is sending double or triple or quadruple the packets so that means you're going to use two three or four times as much data as you would normally with standard bonding so just be aware of that and that's why TCP ramp up the idea here is to get get some utilization of the circuit fast without costing you w smoothing the entire time Ford error correction it uses parody bits it's built for like broadcasting where it's like a one-way stream and it only uses uh 13 and 26% overhead instead of 100 200 and 400% so you kind of have this uh low and high so the low is going to be 133% and high is going to be 26% and so it lets you add parody resiliency without sucking up an entire streams worth of overhead or bandwidth packet fragmentation um when we when I think this got messed up in 8.2 firmware is but when we started messing around with speed fusion and people were trying to deploy during covid people trying to deploy uh Cisco access points over speed Fusion networks uh their Cisco APS wouldn't talk and it's because they had this DF flag and um we needed to block the DF flag because basically we're fragmenting over speed fusion and it was messing up the the Cisco APS so we th this feature allows you to fragment Cisco APS when they say Do not fragment on the DF flag and then Dynamic weighted bonding um replaces traditional bonding it's Now the default with uh I think it became the default with 831 if I'm not mistaken um Dynamic dwdb became the the default bonding and you have your congestion latency level the idea behind Dynamic weighted bonding is to mitigate congestion by by detecting packet loss and latency so basically the if a if a tower is congested if there's too many people using that Tower uh the more data you consume the more latency you're G to have it's going to spike up it's gonna be like 80 milliseconds idle and then it's going to go to like 1600 or 3,000 milliseconds of latency and the reason is because there's not enough bandwidth on the tower to give you the internet the the the usage you're requesting so what we've decided is what we've done is dynamic weighted sping monitors latency and then will throttle the circuit down until it's within a acceptable latency window so making sure you don't use too much bandwidth what this really does is traditional bonding would not allow you to bond circuits that are more than 50% off of each other so if you had well it would allow it it would just affect the performance so if you had if you're bonding like a 100 Meg circuit and a 50 meg circuit in theory you'd only get the 50 plus about a 75 it actually you'd lose about 25 megabits of throughput then you would then have the 18% overhead with bonding and it would take away add additional throughput Dynamic weighted bonding will allow you to have dispar links and better handles those it still isn't perfect if you have if you're getting like 25 kilobits per second like if you're being throttled by the carrier to that 56 kilobits or something like that it it doesn't work well there but outside of carrier throttling it's great for congestion detection and management um nutshell it's it's the 5G version of bonding right it's so different line networks and so that's really what you know there's there's not any company out there that's able to keep up with the pace of how these networks are taking shape and optimizing performance on those networks better than peplink and that's really what dynamic weighted bonding is every single firmware version there's an update and an improvement to that algorithm because these networks are getting built out still to this day and so yeah they're constantly evolving and you want to be with a company that can evolve with those Technologies and that's what peplink does ignore packet loss events basically says hey don't treat packet loss as congestion um so it's saying that packet loss does not mean congestion it means that it's just a crappy circuit I'm sorry I should said that on recording but um it's basically saying don't treat packet loss as congestion um and then you can disable buffer bloat handling and disable uh TCP a optimization and then you can set a a packet Jitter buffer default is 150 milliseconds but if you need that to be more strict you can lower that it's just be aware that that's that's going to be our Jitter buffer that's kind of there to to to help you create the best bonding environment now then at the bottom we have our Wan connection priority W connection priority is the order in which these WS are going to be used so I mentioned um this is now this particular router this is my Hub router so I only have one internet W one but when I get to my Transit router I'll show you something different if you click the question mark here I then can enable asymmetric connection testing I can enable connection mapping I can enable cut off latency and I can enable suspension time after packet loss all of these are designed to help you manage different Wan environments so for example say I have four AT&T and four T-Mobile and AT&T only has band 14 and 66 and T-Mobile only has band 25 and 41 I could make one AT&T upload on band 41 or B Band 14 download on band uh 14 upload on ban 66 and download on ban 66 and so one entire Sim is being used for downloading on band 66 one entire Sim is being used for upload on band 66 one you and I and so you can actually customize how these how how your internet circuits are being used uh for upload and download over speed Fusion you can also tell it which connections allowed to if you have a a Cox fiber line at one location and a Cox fiber line at the other location and they're getting three milliseconds of latency between them because they're on the same Hub and they're you could do large files I could say Wan one on this router only talks to WAN one on the other router so Cox only talks to Cox and they can they can they can use their internal Network it's not leaving that Network to be able to talk to each other um this is also used for private networks if I have an NLS circuit or a private wireless network I can say those two devices it's a private network not going out to the internet just talk W one to W one or Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi um and it's going to do that for you that's actually How We Do NLS and private networking as well but we've also used this with with common carriers connecting so if I have unity and at one site and unity at the other site and I have Cent at one site and cogent at another site I could say cogent talks to cogent Unity talks to Unity then Bond those together so I'm still bonding cogent and unity but it's it's they're staying inside their Network they're not talking cross Network and then leaving their infrastructure so it's a great way to optimize Performance Based on your needs cut off latency this says hey this is the maximum latency that I want to have if if you want your maximum latency to be 150 milliseconds you just put that in there now if you're doing that over cellular or starlink I would hesitant just put 150 maybe 300 but you want to you know you can say don't use this circuit if the latency exceeds a certain latency and then suspension time after packet loss this says Hey suspend this circuit after packet loss is detected for a certain amount of milliseconds um so you could say hey suspend this for 3 seconds or something like that um because I don't want packet loss on my network so latency U this is latency to the destination uh the way peplink works um someone asked a question is the cut off laser measured per provider Network or is it measured all the way to the speed Fusion Cloud exit point so it's measured to the The Hub device so this is between Hub and spoke so this is the latency between the Hub and the spoke so it's measuring the actual connection between these devices and um and then it's uh and that's the latency so if that through your entire network through all the internet between the Hub and the spoke that's that's the um what's being measured there so one last thing with manual provisioning is if I go to the very top speed Fusion VPN profile click the question mark I can right here to configure multiple tunnels click here I can create multiple tunnels I can create to five different tunnels and these tunnels can now have their own settings different from each other so I can make a setting called Wan one and literally I could say one let me just say off duplicate that down Wan one on and literally this tunnel will only use Wan one I can make another tunnel called when smoothing and turn on W smoothing I can make another tunnel called FEC and turn on FEC I can make another tunnel that is mobile Internet only and I could say mobile and so I can create these tunnels now when you're manually creating these tunnels they these names this tunnel name must match exactly on both ends so you want to make sure that that what you're doing on the left you're doing on the right so if I'm doing this on my sdx router I need to make sure my Transit router has the exact same names and spellings for these tunnels I could also create another tunnel called VLAN 10 layer 2 and make a layer 2 span of VLAN 10 and use a sub tunnel to span layer the VLAN 10 over Layer Two so that's a very common way something that we do here is we'll do a like a if we want to span layer VLAN 10 and layer three route all the other vlans I can create layer VLAN 10 on both routers the the sdx and my remote and then use this tunnel to span Layer Two I'm not going to do that right now um and so so if I did this then I could hit save and apply changes and I'm GNA get the sprinters Network here then I go to my Patriot router right here oop hold on one second I have speed Fusion ic2 enabled give me one second delete save changes turn off save changes and then I can go to my speed Fusion Patriot and I can give it a my local ID Patriot hit save create a new profile we can call this uh sdx HQ remote ID sdx HQ no oops sorry sdx HQ going to turn off encryption so here's where everything like I mentioned everything has to match so I'm going to click this question mark click multiple tunnels and so this one we have the W one so I need to call this one W one now I don't have to only have W one on this one I can name it something I can use use it for something else but I need to have it there when smoothing FEC and mobile you can see how kind of annoying this is I'm actually doing this on purpose because I want to show you guys how much easier life will be so with this one I'm going to turn on way smoothing this one I'm going to turn on uh FEC this one is going to be mobile only so I'm going to turn off all these and just do cellular one and cellular two and this one I could actually do my starlink which is W one so I'll go and do it just because it's you know why not right off duplicate W one okay so we got W one Wan smoothing FEC and T-Mobile and then I got to put in my public IP address of the Hub which is right here put in right there hit save second I think my when I disabled the profile there okay save there we go so if you notice here I lost connection to the router because I what I did is I deleted the start the profile which had outbound policies and so switched over and so the tunnel need to be cre all I did was go back to the in control create a new remote desktop remote admin session refreshed my session and then click to say changes and it worked just fine click apply changes go to dashboard and I should be able to go to the dashboard of this guy and there's all of our tunnels starting there you go updating routes normally when I'm creating my training videos I pause during this section so it's like it's like a cooking video kind of the the the the cake pre-made uh so I pause the video wait for all this to establish and hit start so you you guys get to watch it in real time I'll answer some questions while we're waiting for this to establish okay um we experienc weird issues with these priorities we have starlinks and several 5gs when using and when our users go over the starlink subscription so the starlink still shows us on but none of the data goes through unfortunately that's not a clear enough question for me to to answer um uh Stig but if you if you email either Travis pink.com or Peter West networks.com one of us be more than happy to get you in contact with a partner and or help you step through that um I would I would need a little bit more detail to answer that fully uh issue a data on data loss on FW IPC tunnel is transiting peplink speed Fusion tunnel any links so if you're if you're doing IPC over speed Fusion you want to make sure you turn off Nat T so if you go to Advanced and service pass through so service pass through is an option right here IPC Nat T default is enabled and it's going to make it difficult to force IPC traffic over speed Fusion it's going to try to use a Wan circuit so if you want IPC clients on your network to Traverse speed Fusion you want to turn that off and hit save and apply and that's going to allow IPC if there's another issue you uh you'd have to get the logs and troubleshoot it but that would be my whenever I hear IPC issues over speed Fusion the first thing is turn off IPC mat T in a troubleshooting scenario is there a log section where I can when names are correct um it's hard to U I don't know if those when names are correct it say just syntax unfortunately why is this still spinning it obtaining I wonder if the page didn't get oh yeah I don't think the page loaded there because we do have it activated there refresh that's we smoothing this is why I hate manual Creations by the way I'm gonna show you straight up that this is why manual tunnels is annoying because everything has to be right there is a little bug in 841 that if there's not a landside device oh I don't have a land plugged in so might be that it's not gonna update routes that's right I remember that bug okay well anyways it it did yeah that's why it's spinning up updating because I have nothing plugged into the land of this Transit um so but anyways that's how you do it and it did it did connect so it we're good it just I have nothing plugged into it so you can see that right there um basically a lab impact bug right if there's not any on your device your lab device may not come up and so we we found this bug it's a no issue there's a fix for the firmware but um yeah in these kinds of scenario2 yeah okay well that's how you create tunnels in in the router um and it did it did come up just not all the way because it's yeah yeah that's why the other side stuck I remember actually remember that now because a client says spinning at updating routes because there's nothing plugged into this router um so then we can talk about manual doing the same thing but inside in control so I'll show you how much easier this is set speed Fusion configuration enable add a tunnel star choose my sdx look at that public IP automatically shows up choose my Rebel click next click show advanced settings and now I can hit speed Fusion or I could name this sprinters turn off in uh uh encryption Dynamic weighted bonding is automatically enabled here I can have my w smoothing is disabled TCP rep is dis dis ramp pep is disabled for Ford error correction is disabled and then I have this link settings right here I click link settings you see right here tunnels one I can click edit add and I can go down to Tunnel one and name this Wan smoothing when smoothing and then I can go in here to smoothing normal smoothing normal and then I could add another tunnel I'm only going to add two for the essence of safety and time for everybody FEC FEC and then I can turn on FEC low and FEC low so basically what I have is my default policy which could have like TCP ramp up enabled but just that Dynamic weighted bonding then I have a Wan smoothing one and then I have an FC one so then if I hit save it's going to warn you that only the primary tunnel is going to work without um outbound policies and so it's going to say hey you got these tunnels you have three tunnels here so I can hit save then I can go to my Wan settings and now I can configure those same Wan settings you see I've got three tunnels FEC W smoothing and primary so I can I can click on the Patriot to WAN smoothing click modify Wan settings show advance and all those same options show up under Wan settings so everything I just did on the manual mode I can do inside in control except for it's going to guarantee all the syntax it's going to make sure everything's typed right everything's properly brokered the keys are properly set up um and you can set up those same same settings hit cancel hit close hit next hit finish save changes and now the tunnels will rebuild using in control oops there you go so you see that connection to Patriot primary way smoothing and FEC so we have our three tunnels how bunch of questions here let's see here when I add a new W connection to my bonded tunnel like a six W to fifth wi the tunnel disconnects and reconnects well if you're changing the Ws it's going to reprovision and therefore it would disconnect and reconnect right that would be my expectation too yeah yeah I mean I I would say when you're configuring the tunnels when you reconfigure it's going to do that if you have all six of them connected as long as it stays connected you should be fine like I should be able to have six WS unplug one and as long as that connection isn't the public IP that's being used then it should still work otherwise um there's another question just email text support and troubleshooting scenario is there log section where you can check the W names oh I already did that one um I guess the last time I tried turn on speed Fusion for bonding it has a monthly quota there's no monthly quota for bonding there's a monthly quota for S sfc which we will go to in just a second um do you have an sdx on the other end could you use a V1 Max yes you can use any peplink router I have an S X because I have a plethora of routers but um the uh but you could use any router that supports speed Fusion the br1 max you got to be a little careful of because depending on which hardware and firmware you have they don't come with speed Fusion but the br1 pro would um but any of our lowend like the br1 or the the the 20x or the old 20s some of those had that Prime care for for Speed fusion and if you have 841 firmware and you have it connected in control it downloads the free speed Fusion bonding license and that's now persistent but um if you have an older firmware that doesn't support 841 that would not be the case for you um so uh br1 would be the one bad example there that it might not work with every br1 but it would work with most v1s or mod yeah the other the other big consideration is just knowing that your head-end device will be potentially a bottle for the Remote device you size that headend device appropriately for Speed Fusion through put and your your Wan links yeah yeah so speed Fusion is yeah speed Fusion is available on almost all mod on all modern routers um so all 2023 2024 routers um speed Fusion is available um you just need to make sure that that the speed Fusion bonding performance is there so for example if I have the transit Duo and bonding to an sdx I've got more than enough bandwidth to support that but if I'm if I have an mbx hd4 5G and I have a Transit Duo as my Hub that's not going to work right I I'm gonna get way more bandwidth on a bonded 5G than I am on a on the even though the the ethernet plugged into the transits gigabit the transit doesn't support 500 Megs of bonding internet and therefore you're going to throttle or create a choke point on your router so we got the exact same scenario um once again I have nothing plugged into my land so I apologize so just going to be stuck at updating routers but you can see that the primary cnel established and the other stuck on updating routes I have nothing plugged into it um and so you can see how easy it is now we're running short on time so I do want to cover speed Fusion connect so we talked about creating subt uh bonding and sub tunnels so we've done that here the next thing is peplink has a public bonding service say this is awesome but what if I don't have an sdx or another router or a Home Connection peplink has a a cloud service called sfc protect sfc protect is Pink's Geo redundant uh diverse I guess um bonding service Cloud bonding service this allows you to create a bonded tunnel between your mobile router and the internet without the need of an infrastructure like an sdx the downside to this is that one it's limited to it's limited to 200 megabits per second so it's limited to 200 megabits per second you have to have you have a quota so after you use your quota you're going to be limited to H fair use so after the quota you'll have a fair use of 10 megabits per second um and then it's and and it's outbound there's no public IP or inbound connectivity it's an outbound bonded service what's nice about this if you have an RV for example or you working from home sfc was built for the RV or or the work from anywhere person if I have if I'm working for my RV like I am right now actually and I wanted to protect this internet let me go to my Transit Duo here so here's my Transit I could go to the network tab that's sfc connect go to client mode choose I'm just going to choose automatic hit hit the little green check box there I can click on this sfc I can create all those same tunnels I can create a w smoothing and I can create an FEC um and a regular bonding I create all the same settings hit save andit apply changes but what's cool about this under the SF connect tab I can then route by application so I can say micros Google meet Zoom Microsoft teams and you can I I'll let you see the whole list here for a few seconds and all of these applications I can route dynamically over sfc so if I'm in an RV and all I have is a br2 pro 5G or a Transit duo with Starling I can protect my Google my teams and my Google and my zoom meetings I can make all of those fun function reliably while my Netflix and all those other applications can just use the regular internet so my my starlink or my 4G or 5G connections and so this protects my zoom calls but allows me to use the Internet sfc is a publicly hosted VPN which means Hulu and zoom or sorry Zoom Hulu and Netflix and YouTube video uh TV will see this as a VPN and they're going to say hey you're on a VPN and they're not going to let you to to use it a lot of the times so sfc was built by peplink to provide users with quality bonding for their mission critical application if you want to be able to watch Zoom uh zoom and Hulu and all that stuff not zoom I'm so sorry Netflix and Hulu peplink set up a special speed Fusion connect service called relay relay mode relay mode is powered by SF connect and you can PL this into your home router so at your house let's take the same setup contrl C let to make a new tab real fast contrl V you can install a I don't think I have a B1 icon yet nope we'll do a 20x okay we'll do a 310 5G you can plug a peplink router at your house you can plug this peplink router at your house into your cable internet broadband and this does not have to have a static public IP this can just be plugged right into your cable internet no static public IP it has y Wi-Fi it just replaces your router this can be a any IP address it needs to be then you can use relay mode to connect your Transit over SF connect to your home internet and then you can route all your traffic to your home this way your DVR your Netflix your Hulu your YouTube video it looks like you're coming from your house so as you travel the world boom done and the way to do this is on your Hub device so I'm going to go back to my sdx I can go to SF connect choose relay mode for inbound access so we're going to pretend I don't have a public IP I have to choose a location so we're going to say I'm closest to it well I'm closest to Atlanta but I don't have that one so I'll do Dallas hit okay and I'm going to get this code right here you see this code so I just go contrl C apply changes and then on my Transit I can go to re um client mode relay sharing put in that code hit the green check box apply changes and now this Transit Duo is going to talk to that sdx via speed Fusion connect and so now I don't have to have public IPS I don't have to have any inbound port foring or anything like that they're going to connect together now I still be limited to my 200 megabits per second it's still going to use my SF quota but now I can send all my traffic out the tunnel so now what I can do is go back to my SF connect go to Route by SSID and right here relay I can choose my Wii and I can make this keer West relay hit add it's going to create a new SSID called keer West relay anything that connects to that SSID automatically looks like it's coming from that sdx it's going to send all the traffic over speed Fusion connect to that relay so you can have your your smartphones and your your TVs and your tablets and things like that that need to use Netflix or Hulu on the re delay Wi-Fi and let them go out your home internet and it'll look like it's coming from your your Broadband circuit at home okay will it be a speed Fusion app for Pink's future allow clients to assound yes so they already have a speed Fusion app oh clients no so we have a speed Fusion app but it's not for client VPN we use openvpn for that right now um I really really badly want a speed Fusion app so I'm GNA say hey pep Link's on the phone here can we have a speed Fusion app but um unfortunately it does not exist yet um we use sfc protect uh using sepal data centers worldwide Maritime industry yep yeah it works it works great for maritime applications sometimes websites are not working due to the public IP of the data center so it can't be solved so so this is not an issue or a bug this is what I'm talking about with vpns Netflix and Hulu and other providers will block vpns we're using a public data center like cloudfare and a few others to have Fusion hubs for you to use and it gets seen as a bpn there the only solution is what I just said relaying it to a data center or your house um so you can either Bond back to your office like if you're an MSP Bond you know host a host a fusion hub for your for your clients um if you're um you or put a peplink router at your house and use your cable internet to bond back or get fiber internet at your house um you know if you have a yacht I'm sure you can afford that the um the but the the sfc the speed Fusion connect is only going to be good for um bonding your zoom and teams and things like that because there are websites are going to see that as a VPN and there isn't a way to solve that in the future it's a publicly service a publicly available service and therefore the answer is is Bond it to your house and bond it to a corporation using standard speed fusion um change both land IP and subon on each device or can just change I don't Chad I don't fully understand the context maybe maybe that was part of another conversation yeah I'm typing through there I think okay I optimize cloudification is not possible is it possible to exclude Services uh um not really um once again Yahoo you want to include not exclude uh for bonding um so so not really uh there's no real easy way to exclude services in in an outbound policy um multiple W connections above um on side one side is the new B one yep and the other side is a balance two both on latest firmware oh I'm guess that's someone talking to you uh is there any plans to increase connection bandwidth on speed Fusion protect I've heard rumors Abby that there are plans to increase or have like an Enterprise or higher performance bonding but once again that really goes back to just thr a fusion Hub in AWS is are Global Cloud I mean the fusion Hub I I talked about this sdx that's expensive you can download the fusion hub for free um I mean like for free so if I went to go back to peplink University and I go to organiz ation warranty and licenses I can scroll down here and say acquire Fusion Hub solo license acquire send this to my Patriot speed Fusion Patriot proceed continue boom there's a license and serial number now inside my my group there's a fusion Hub I can take that Fusion Hub throw it in a WS aour glub cloud or my house or anywhere I want and bond my speed Fusion Patriot and have unlimited bandwidth well well the limitation of the transit Duo um or mbx or any other router so beling has a lot of solutions for bonding it's not that's what's so cool is the sfc is just requires no infrastructure but but once you outgrow the sfc we have a lot of options for you like the like the fusion Hub Solo or relay through your house or setting up a dedicated router at your house with a public IP um or setting up a peplink router at your your office and and bonding to that um and so there's a lot of options to increase throughput the idea is to know which those what options are there and why we would need those options private Cloud applications with my P router via SSC so uh if you want to connect your public Cloud applications with your peplink router via sfc then you would want to use um relay mode um but I would need to see your private Cloud you'd probably have to have that's uh Matt if you email Peter atwest networks.com or if you have a partner email them um or email me and I'll help you get in contact with your partner um that would be a fun one to architect but probably outside the scope of this call yeah and that's outside of the scope of speed Fusion connect that's really what Fusion Hub and the routers are there for is those Advanced scenarios and speed Fusion connect is just those internet public applications like you said Peter so I totally agree that's a good partner conversation yeah it's a good partner so um uh someone asked if you could um show the unbreakable meaning of speed fusion um so let me let me show you why we call that this or why we call it that give me one second so let me go to to here so so on my Patriot if I go to my Patriot router here if I go to status we because we Bond if I go to my status speed Fusion VPN you're going to see all my tunnels here and so if you see here my my speed Fusion VPN I have my connection to speed Fusion Atlanta my connection to Detroit for my home and you can see here this is my my starlink w and my two cellulars so because I'm bonding these any one of these connections can can fail and my connection My Stream will not fail as long as I'm using outbound policies to control the flow of that traffic then that connection is going to be persistent so once you get your tunnels up and running and I do apologize everybody we're going a little over I hope hope you got I see a bunch of people staying on I'm so thankful for this because there's a lot of information to collect here um once you have your tunnels established I told you showed you how to do outbound policies using SF connect but you also need to create outbound policies to use your tunnel once you create it so once I set up a tunnel I can go to Advanced outbound policy and what I like to do is Bond all my traffic to my data center when I'm running ma when I'm creating my own network so if I'm like if I'm on my my mobile units I'm bonding all my traffic so but then you could create a policy called bonding and here now I can be more specific so I can say if the source is my my camera's IP address camera IP right or if my source is of some device or if my destination is a streaming service youtube.com right so if my destination's YouTube and then I can say enforce priority weighted bance I can create a policy I'm gonna do priority just because it's one I like and then I can say send that traffic using Wan smoothing or FEC it's probably more appropriate one because I'm streaming drag all these off so I so I can create a says if I'm streaming to YouTube and YouTube gives me a link like R rtmp doyoutube docomomo feec and then I can say if there's nothing available fail through the next rule but if my if my router is booting up and the tunnel's not created yet terminate the sessions and move them over to FC so if this tunnel goes down fail through if it comes back move move the traffic back over to the FPC this policy says hey no matter where I am on my network on my Transit if I'm going out to to youtube.com I want to make sure that I'm using FEC so my my stream my stream's going to be reliable if I'm going to uh what's that Vimeo or whatever stream server whatever you know stream domain.com so whatever my streaming domain is send it out there it's GNA be it's going to then send that traffic over FEC I could also say any protocol UDP and pick real-time me streaming protocols right like um rtsp or I could do SRT oh I don't have RTS but I'll so I'll do rtsp but anyways you could you could do a realtime streaming protocol and basically say if my realtime streaming protocol is detected send it out FEC protecting that traffic one of the things that I like to do personally is I have the and once again I little spoiled uh so I'm going to admit that straight up I'm a little spoiled but you know my sdx it's plugged into a a 9 gbit internet connection it's got static public IPS I just Bond all my traffic so if you look at my personal router that I'm using right now today so here's my T-Mobile my two T-Mobile 5gs here's my connection to my head and unit and I'm simply just bonding all traffic back and so you can see there's my I you know 70 72 Mill seconds of latency zero pack loss and this is my stream that I'm using to talk to you guys so I just Bond all my traffic back to the headend and actually um just protect everything that keeps me up and running and reliable and Mak sure that that I'm good to go um and that's what we mean by unbreakable when we talk about unbreakable it's combining two or more internet connections to create a super reliable connection yeah I've seen a lot of questions too about how that plays out like there's a few different terms that we talk about but in the guy it's not clear what or where those things are so like hot failover versus bonding there's no hot failover button in the tunnel setup and so that's it's kind of tricky because it's it's basically implied when you've got priority one priority two hot failover is switching from Priority One to a priority two connection yeah so if I go to my my go ahead yeah I was going to say so if I go like for example for hot failover if I go to my my connection settings here show advance and go to my Wan links hot failover says Patriot primary tunnel modify Wan so use my Wan then use my cellular so what I'm doing is saying use the WAN first then the cellular second that's hot failover it's going to use that Wan circuit and then if the WAN circuit fails the the cellular is going to kick in that's hot failover um and and so you know now in order for that to work all of the connections have to be active on the router's dashboard so in the router's dashboard you want to make sure all the tunnel the the internet connections are active that way when you are hot failover it's going to be instantaneous it's going to be seconds yeah the other thing that I will point out too is like there the two priority two that's bonding those two together and that also inherits that hot failover so if if W one isn't there and then you're bonding two of those Cellular Connections if one of those Cellular Connections drops you still get that hot failover benefit so any traffic that was using that cellular one is seamlessly handed over to Cellular 2 and cellular 2 needs to carry that load now but those sessions are maintained and handed off seamlessly between those even in the bonding scenario and once your tunnels created the magic and all of this is outbound policies that's really so speed Fusion is Pink's number one magic outbound policies is Pink's number two magic the ability to control by Source destination and even application like FaceTime and and zoom and teams Etc um that outbound policy traffic shaping really matters you have to use both together and you think of speed Fusion whether it's sfc protect or speed Fusion to your data center or speed Fusion relay to your home those are all just additional internet connections that you can then use to send traffic um and so that's why it's it's a little bit more you know there there's more to it and we have an entire webinar on outbound policies but in in control if I go to outbound policies now that we've created our tunnel in control I can create outbound policies right here so you see here's my my bonding to speed Fusion gmv which doesn't exist anymore because we deleted it um I can create a speed Fusion profile that bonds to the sdx you see um and I can make my destination IP address Network domain name group network SAS or even region so I can have a SAS like FaceTime and teams so it's going to bond based on those SAS applications FaceTime in teams to my data center I can also do the exact same thing for sfc so they're sending to my sfc platform so you can use sfc you can use um outbound uh configuration or you can use outbound policies to send that traffic or see how you want that traffic to go but the magic with speed Fusion is enhanced by the power of outbound policies and telling your traffic how to use those connections um we are running over so I'm going to say if you have any additional questions please feel free to email Travis pink.com or Peter atwest networks.com and we would love to outbound policy is on peplink university.com or peplink youtube.com peplink and under the peplink university playlist you can see those outbound policies um but if you have any questions outside of of this please send us an email we'd love to answer those questions and there there's a lot here and I just wanted to have a quick video that people could watch and reference to understand what speed Fusion is and how it works thank you so much for your time Travis thank you once again for 14 Successful video platforms here or videos here and um I look forward to the next one absolutely thank you all folks for joining and yeah we'll be back in a month I'll see you next month have a good one thanks folks goodbye bye"}

{"topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "in this video I will demonstrate how to set up l2tp with IPC so what is l2tp the layer 2 tunneling protocol also known as l2tp is used to transfer information securely and rapidly across public networks the protocol has plenty of used cases but the most well-known is being part of virtual private networks also known as vpns the layer 2 tunneling protocol actually comprises two protocols Microsoft pptp and Cisco's ltf in practice there are two endpoints of a tunnel created via l2tp the l2tp access concentrator Lac and the l2tp network server LNS the Lac receives data from remote devices and routes it securely to the LNS the Lac negotiates a point-to-point connection to transmit data frames the LNS is at the other end of the L 2tp tunnel and functions as the termination point for point-to-point sessions it acts as a Gateway between public and private networks and allows encrypted traffic to access network assets so why use IPC with l2tp l2tp does not work alone the protocol lacks encryption and authentication features and an additional protocol must Supply both security functions in most cases Internet Protocol security also known as IP SEC provides these data protection services so we commonly use the designation l2tp IPC IPC enables l2tp to serve as a VPN connection with endtoend security what are the possible applications of using l2tp the first application is that l2tp can be used as a VPN that being said it cannot be used as a VPN alone it has to be paired with an additional protocols such as IPC the second application is to use lttp to extend a lan Network to include remote devices this is a useful feature for work from home arrangements and on-site remote work the final important application is to use l2tp in Public Access Wi-Fi network l2tp tunneling is regularly used to construct and secure public Wi-Fi networks this is a common feature of networks owned by a large organization such as colleges schools libraries or airports when a customer or user connects with an individual access point this creates an l2tp session the advantage of using l2tp is that it is very secure and private when combined with ipse it is extremely easy to use since setting up an l2tp VPN connection is simple it is very flexible as well an example of this is that companies can share infrastructure between between different locations more easily since using l2tp makes it easier to shift virtual machine infrastructure between physical devices as needed now I will demonstrate how to set up l2tp with IPC the first step is to log on to web admin for your device then if you have a router from the balance series navigate to the network tab if you have a device from the Mac series navigate to the advanced tab then head to the remote user access section here you will have the option to enable the remote user access settings once you enable it you will have the option to customize the VPN type whether it is lttp with IP SEC or pptp you can also input a pre-shared key in the relevant box in the listen on Section you can select the W ports that you want the lttp server to pay attention to be sure that at least one of the One Ports have public IP addresses under the user account section enter the username and passwords for each client who will connect to the VPN for bulk entry click on the question mark to enable passing directly from a CSV file to complete setting up the l2tp VPN on your device the methods will differ based on the operating software you're using for the Android iOS and Mac OSX setting up procedures please refer to the peplink Forum I will now demonstrate how to complete setting up the l2tp VPN for Windows devices the first step is to click on the action center icon on the bottom right and then select the VPN option this will cause the network and internet settings to appear on your screen here you need to find add a VPN connection once you select that you can choose the options for your connection such as VPN provider connection name service name or address VPN type pre-shared key type of signin info the username which is optional and finally a password which is also optional we suggest you consider the following instructions when filling in the fields for the VPN provider select Windows built in for the connection name usually this is something memorable for the server name or address enter the host name or the IP address of your server for the VPN type select the VPN type applicable to your connection in the type of signin info section select the authentication method used for your connection for the username and password enter the username for the VPN connection and the password if applicable once all the details have been put in you can go ahead and click save to save all the VPN connection settings after you've done that you should see your saved VPN connection profile which will be listed for you to select if you can see that then you can start configuring the settings related to the l2tp VPN connection this can be done by heading to the Network and Sharing Center on the bottom right of your screen this will cause the Network and Sharing Center window to appear on the left of this window you will see the option to change adapter settings after clicking on that you'll see the l2tp VPN connection that you've created right click and select properties then click on security the suggest tested configurations are as follows the first one is to select allow these protocols then also ensure that the Microsoft chap version 2 is selected then you select the advanced settings button in doing so you can ensure that your desired authentication method for the l2tp VPN connection is selected and the key credentials are present if applicable the final step is to connect the l2tp VPN connection this can be done by opening the network and internet settings window under the VPN tab you should also be able to see the lttp VPN connection you set up you can now go ahead and click connect"}

Peter west.com and and so we we set that up and then had it in NS record pointing to oxen to AT&T and I I was able to unplug my Cox's internet and have mail. Peter west.com work and yeah it was amazing I was like this is nuts like I don't have to have round robin DNS I I don't have to have male one and male two which was the common thing right you'd have mail and then mail to or VPN and VPN 2 and and so it's just VPN Dot and remote Dot and mail Dot and I was like this is insane the for $400 I have this inbound load balancing and then outbound load balancing I then had redundancy on my outbound internet connectivity yeah um and and it it blew my mind and then in 2018 we did a big project doing multiple pedabytes of data and I reached out to a guy named Tim simor um and I was like hey I I had this small router but you have something bigger like a bigger version of that that can do like gigabits of or gigabit gigabit per second and he goes we have this 380 and it's a gigabit router you've got to invest in the company though if you want to be a partner like we need need to you you need to show your investment and I said okay so I bought I bought this five of these routers and deployed two of them in ha for this project and I've literally never gone back like that it changed my world and it's it's it's how I got into peplink and um it's uh it's watching the technology grow and you can kind of see this cool timeline but watching the balance grow into the max with the cellular routers and we started getting into Healthcare and mobile connectivity and really solving complex problems then adding in control 2 like we had the in control with the AP manager but they didn't have a router manager and so when they launched in control 2 and added the router management functionality I was able to go from supporting my local companies in in in North Florida to the whole world I could support anybody anywhere at any time right from a web browser and then speed fusion um enabled the ability to do NLS replacement and real-time healthc care um and increased our capabilities even more then they added speed Fusion connect during the pandemic which offered us to offer Speed Fusion of people without an infrastructure and that's really what it is it's people that don't have an infrastructure and can't use speed Fusion you can use speed Fusion connect for that or speed Fusion relay um and you know when 4G came out they told me oh you're never gonna this is this is waste you're just gonna have a a a 4G router it's gonna replace your Brad band 5G came out and they said oh you're not gonna need bonding you're not GNA need multiple Sims 5G is going to end it you're going to have 5G as your Broadband it's going to be fiber replacement right to everywhere well we all know that's not the truth anymore I knew that going into it because I watched this transition from 3G to 4G to 5G but but it's more important now our technology our our Hardware our software is more important now that we have 5G because more people see the value in connectivity everywhere always Y and so everybody anytime someone needs connectivity everywhere and always we're the answer what that's what peplink does um and then they we just wanted to kick everybody in the The Shins a little bit and say oh by the way in touch out of band management built in with speed Fusion connect and and in control and it's free so I mean you know it's like just to like little little dagger and everybody that you know the competitor's side that just says not not to mention bonding and sdwan and in control management we now have this out of band management um and we can take your legacy appliances or hardware and manage it right inside in control and that that just in my opinion so yeah and I think it's it's fun again because it kind of comes back to the beginning right like when peplink started these were things that were all going on in the industry right these outof band management networks were all being built and you know people are still doing these things the same way today and like you know again here's peping there's a better way to do those things and so um yeah it's you know we're just trying to solve problems and make it as easy as possible for people but right you know like you said that you built your whole business on it right and I've built my whole career on it and it's a it's a transformative technology in in so many ways because it yeah big or small it it's applicable and it's useful and it and it solves problems right it makes connectivity Better Man U Michael asked a question about our road map we're going to talk about that later Michael just yeah yeah we got a bunch of fun new stuff talk to talk about little bit later in the show is peplink a better fit for larger small businesses so I guess I was kind of stealing my own Thunder there um that that's what I think is my favorite thing about this is with peplink is like it's not one or the other right like so many products you look at it it's like oh that's a great small business product but terrible for Enterprise right or vice versa there's really not but peplink is that thing that really works for everybody and everybody may not use it the same way but you know everybody wants zoom in teams to work better right everybody wants their calls to be clearer right that that much is pretty much a given for every business out there I know for me I mean last week I was deploying a mult what seven 2500s to for a very large multi-billion dollar Enterprise all over the country I went from Gainesville Florida to Houston to um uh to Seattle Washington and a couple places in Texas and Tampa Florida and deployed 2500s for increased performance and speed for for Speed fusion and so you know I mean that's a very large Enterprise but we also have um I've got an RV installed tomorrow and so we're gonna be setting up a br2 pro 5G uh on an RV and and so for me the answer to that question is is that it it it's it's really does peplink solve your mission and and you know can it complete the mission and and so that's what you have to ask yourself is what's my mission and and how can I accomplish that mission but whether it's a small business a Soho you know a residential guy or even a very very large Enterprises um which is sort of our specialty at West networks it I we're able to to complete the mission and that and that's really what at least what makes me so proud of the product yeah we're not exactly a household name but there are you know really really big household names using peplink all over the place and it's just you know there's just more and more and it's fun too because I mean like you know like we talked about the early days you know I'm from kind of nowhere Minnesota North Dakota right and when I started this there weren't local customers here but now I can list 10 15 20 different customers in my local city that I didn't sell them peplink right they got sold peping through other people because it's grown to be such a big thing now and it's again in lot ways behind the scenes but yeah we're out there big and small um if we go to the next one I think there's some other cool things because I think if we look down the road maybe not just down the road but today really like someone asked me to screen um can you tell me about sub talk talk about Subaru a little bit I mean that was that's been a really fun project and I I know I helped with uh one of their events but but you help with a lot of their stuff Travis they're they're so much fun because they're like probably one of the most challenging customers I've faced like you know and that's fun to say because like over the years I've gotten really comfortable in trusting Ping's technology to solve any connectivity challenge right and I think you can agree with me there like you can go into any situation with a lot of confidence because you know you've got this speed Fusion there to to make it all better right and um they just kept bringing me into harder and harder places further and further out where they just you know basically aren't signals from anything right and it's like I can't bond together right nothing plus nothing still equals nothing and so they just pushed the envelope even further than I guess I really realized needed to be and so you know when there's no signal you need bigger antennas you need satellites right need more options and so you know starlink developed right in parallel as our our Subaru relationship developed and so yeah over a couple of years wow we've developed a really robust system for them to be able to go out and broadcast from anywhere now right and so yeah it's just fun to find people that really want to push that envelope and you know push our idea of even what's what the furthest is um but yeah at the end of the day they're trying to get on YouTube and and in Instagram live and you know do the things that a lot of different people are doing again big and small it's Subaru is neat for me because um they are a bigger company and especially their their race team and what they're doing and the the challenge of what they're trying to accomplish but then they're using the same tools that we all use they're using Instagram live they're using uh GoPro cameras and downloading content but then they're like downloading really large uh files to to map the engines that we weren't even allowed to look at because it's all their proprietary engine Technologies but um y but they are um using a lot of the same technologies that that we use every day especially our broadcast customers I mean they're they're really a a neat case study for evaluating how the the broadcast capabilities are really prevalent and and have grown in popularity with our product line um from from the ubrs all the way to the mbx hd4 5G yeah I think I think the way they operate really captures the way in a lot of ways what the larger broadcast industry is turning into right it's the small person with consumer technology just you know just bombing in there right just kind of more of a gorilla Onan show type of setup but yeah that's what this this technology allows you to do is you know take somebody small and do big things with it so yeah it's fun to work with them and see how they're again pushing it further more case studies on that but I was just gonna ask about Erikson because that's actually it's in the slides but I actually didn't know about that one so I thought maybe you could talk about that one and obviously I can talk about Healthcare a little bit Yeah and this I think this plays in a lot of different directions well because you know Erikson makes they're they're a vendor of private 5G infrastructure and so um they've they've been making private cellular infrastructure for a long time um and so we're we've been a member of their industry two industry 4.0 program so that we certify our devices with their private cellular infrastructure and so private 5G is kind of like it's kind of a silly way to say but it's like super Wi-Fi right it's like Wi-Fi on steroids instead of it like blanketing your whole city you're using it like a really strong really reliable Wi-Fi network on your campus in your manufacturing environment um at your outdoor venue right so you use that 5G technology but in a smaller scale um but yeah we're certified and we're partnered with them and so you know we're working on literally some of the world's biggest private 5G deployments hand inand with you know peplink devices on on these Erics and private 5G networks and you know private 5G networks of all kinds but not just Ericson but yeah as a as an example they're you know really pushing that envelope of what um again big and small businesses can do with this technology on the private side might not be able to answer this next question but I'm curios Ericson obviously owns one of our competitors how does that play into this like this case study because I saw this case this company name and I go wow this is interesting that you know they're they're inviting us to be part of it and obviously there's some synergies there with their product line that they have but um what is if you don't mind what is this industry 4.0 ecosystem and um and how does that play for for maybe maybe some partners that are on the line that might be looking at you know that might be having a challenge when they're facing with our competitor that is part of this bigger company yeah so it's just exactly like uh a bigger cellular network right so like if you look at a Verizon network or an AT&T network they have all these base stations out there and they have different companies that make those Samsung makes some of them Ericson makes some of them there's different companies and they use multiple companies multiple brands or vendors to build their bigger networks and so you've got you know Samsung phones and Apple phones and peplink routers and cradle Point routers all these different routers on all these different Bas stations and so it's similar in the private side you've got a Bas station side and then all these devices can connect to it right you're G to have tablets you're GNA have phones you're GNA have Pepin so you might have cradle points right all these different 5G devices can connect to those networks just like again on the bigger public networks and so yeah um Ericson does have a a you know they they make the cellular infrastructure but they have the the Cradle Point brand of client devices too and so anybody can use those devices or a pink device on that Ericson base station infrastructure and that's I think part of what that industry 4.0 program is about is letting customers people who are building these networks have confidence that they know they've got parts that are going to work together so that the Bas station and the clients have all gone through this common testing and know that they're going to be able to perform to a common level and Achieve those those goals um so yeah that's I think in a nutshell what that is and yeah it's kind of fun because peplink software can do things that cradle Point software can't and so when you look at a private 5G environment we're winning deals because we can extend the capabilities and solve networking issues that make so like autonomous vehicles are really big in private 5G deployments so like automobile manufacturing they're using these large scale robots to you know automate those assembly lines move those vehicles around the assembly lines and they need that private 5G that super low latency right that's that's really what that technology delivers but um yeah they need to solve weird little networking challenges that come with these Advanced autonomous systems and speed Fusion sometimes is really the Difference Maker there so um I guess it's a big story to tell but yeah there a a lot with private 5 power on private 5G yeah I mean that that industry is evolving so fast I mean we've talked about it for a couple of years now but 2023 was really the year that that turned real we really saw a lot of real deployments happen this year and so that's really shaping what the industry is going to look like next year for sure I know from West Network side we just we actually just started a really large cbrs private 5G Network for a very large acreage and so we're we're partnering with a couple Partners a couple pebbling Partners to help with this too and um so kind of fun project but yeah the private 5G is definitely exciting um yeah and just for the yeah for the instance of time the and then you know another really neat use case here is you know when covid launched um we were having issues our our customers were having issues like how do I how do I rapidly deploy covid testing and vaccination efforts and and get this down and we and then there were chip shortage CH chip set shortages and and a whole bunch of issues that came around with Logistics and supply chain and it was neat because Pink's unified ecosystem across all of our product line basically allowed us to grab anything off the shelf and connect it together and create a solution so even if we couldn't get mbx hd4 5gs I could connect a br2 and two BR ons you know I we we could figure out how to make the solution work um with the and because ultimately the br1 especially now with this with 8.4 and speed Fusion built in all the way to the epx it's about throughput requirements and then and you know the number of connections we're servicing so if I can connect a bunch of different devices together as long as my throughput is in covid testing was basically access my e EMR and maybe get on the internet wasn't live teleconferencing and things like that or live broadcas needing you know dozens of megabits per second it was it was just being able to process customer needs um Y and so was really neat time for us because we were we were challenged with uh rapidly deploying connectivity unknown and with a whole bunch of different products uh because we just had to piece together what we had um the idea with with covid and rapid response during especially during the covid with the the the shortages of Hardware is that Pink's unified ecosystem allowed us to combine a whole bunch of different router solutions to solve varying connectivity challenges is and and I've had this conversation with a lot of ping Partners over the over the last two years about how they will to basically take ping Hardware of varying types and solve those those connectivity challenges so I know we were working with with Yale New Haven and a couple other hospitals on this um rap you know deploying rapid response and covid testing um and vaccination efforts but Partners all over the country were doing this and we able to do that very easily because we could basically with our unified ecosystem speed Fusion being available on the br1 all the way to the epx and having the same tool set basically just performance differences um allowed us to really solve those challenges and and that's one of the reasons I like peping it's not really about small and large business but we can serve almost any business size because of the the wide range of Hardware that we have br1 from a Soho all the way to the epx for Enterprise or high high demand traffic and now the 2500 EC even um with it's in incredible performance let me re reful scen be hard I think it can be tough for people to appreciate like the the day-to-day side of that too like how easy it is to shift from one model to another in terms of managing it configuration side like yeah it can be really complicated on other vendor systems to like upgrade to a different model right like their management system treats things very um closed off right like this config is for this model and this model only and you have to start over if you have a new model and so yeah we have that a little bit down that ladder is really easy I I really like this idea this slide um when this one came across I kind of got excited about it and I do like the way you re re rewarded it uh Travis but I mean this is you know I've talked about this a little bit when we first started but I was told that when 4G came out I was no longer going to be relevant and I was told in 5G came out I was is no longer going to be relevant when starlink was being teased I was told over and over again that the Pink's dead that has obviously not been the case can you talk about that a little bit yeah it's it obviously Pink's dead I love that because yeah that's just like the tone that we get every time there's a new generation of of Wireless that comes out and like you said it happened with 4G too and um you know it's not about how fast the latest G is right it's about how important is connectivity to your business how much do use does your business rely on it right and so yeah I can have 4GS or 5gs but it's just one connection and that one connection is going to have a problem at some point right it's not the connection's fault right it's like anything that's important in our world you need redundancy you need backups and if it's that important and so yeah 4G doesn't change that 5G doesn't change that starlink doesn't change that but starlink does change and what 5G does change is it gives us really affordable high quality bandwidth in places that we've just never had it before low latency yeah yeah it doesn't take the need for peplink away it creates this awesome opportunity for peplink to put those connections together and give you that awesome Enterprise SLA grade bandwidth anywhere in the world now right that it makes pepling just even more relevant instead of the opposite exactly again you can have like SLA grade 100 plus megabit bandwidth for like 200 bucks a month anywhere in the world like you know you spend a hundred bucks a month on starlink 100 bucks a month on a fixed Wireless 5G plan and try and take me down right like that's that's never been possible before so yeah like you said it's exciting like it is and and I think what's even more exciting um on that is Pink's adaptation of the technology IES like with 8.4 firmware and bringing in starlink um Native support with um you know stowing rebooting but also seeing the UI the the the uids and helping you manage your starlinks with with 8.4 firmware um have have in increased the capabilities of of utilizing the the Technologies um and so it's been really exciting to see how not only are we not afraid of it but it's actually we're empowering those techn techologies in our ecosystem yeah like try to deploy a 100 starlinks for your business today like how do you how do you manage that right how how does your it team manage that what tools do they use to integrate that with the other tools that you use right like how do you control all that stuff like there's this whole new layer of things and yeah if you don't have that integration you've got a whole another thing you have to manage now where with peplink yeah it's all built in you can see all the information there you don't have to have another layer to manage it's just we're going to build as much of that integration as we can whether that's starlink or a different satellite system um so yeah we we want that we want to be that Connection Manager again yeah there's going to be different connections you need over over time to to do what you know you need to do with connectivity so we just want to manage that and make sure that they're all working and and one of the things I love about what you said at our very first tech Summit was you're like and it just increases the number of nines you know you get all these new things like you get a new nine and it's it's like I'm 98% now I'm 99% now I'm 99.9% you know these these better connections and the ability for peping to integrate them just increases the level of nines that we have for reliability and that's ultimately what we're trying to accomplish yeah yep because you know a single 5G connection is not the same as a broadcast truck right that they have different price points they are completely different Technologies and you're going to get different reliability from them right and so yeah if if you want to take these fast modern connections you just need to add more of them if you want that kind of broadcast medical grade reliability but yeah with peping you can get both another uh neat question that we have um is do you need to sign up for peplink device deves in Cloud before kicking them in the gear or having them work and I think there's actually two answers for this so I'm kind of curious what your answer is and then um you know and then we can add on to it I think but I'm curious how how you answer this or how you adopt this when you have question customers asking that so I think yeah there there's a couple layers or a couple conversations wrapped up in this and so um you know there's some people they see the word cloud and that freaks them out because they've got a very security focused mentality right um and so our device is number one every aspect of our ecosystem can run in a public network or a private Network so you can run our management system all these different components you can run those in a private Zero Internet Network so you can take the cloud out of the mix right so no you don't have to sign them up in the cloud to use them you can use them privately in a bunch of different ways um but they all come with that cloud management so you know if you want Cloud management yeah you can definitely sign up for it and that's a good you know that's a good thing to do to just register it in your in your name anyway so that it can't be registered by somebody else but yeah again right away you've got that option with peplink that basically no other router manufacturer in the cellular space has of you can run it on a private Network you can put the management system on a private Network you can put all of the VPN pieces in a private Network and none of it ever has to talk to the internet for licensing or anything so another thing that I wanted to add was you know I I've had a couple customers ask about you know Prime Care versus you know because that subscription based and pep Link's made some changes to that with 8.4 um because like now with 8.4 you have speed Fusion after Prime Care expires um but you do need to connect it to in control first and and so in control or Cloud capabilities gives you the database driven Dynamic content so it's going to give you your SAS applications your content filtering updates it's going to give you centralized Management in in touch you know things that require that that cloud connectivity for where you're downloading new content but the device itself especially if it's a non-prime care device functions forever um especially on a point-to-point infrastructure like connecting a whole bunch of balance 2500s to each other those will work forever regardless of and you get free firmware forever too or until the until it's no longer relevant um and so so you get free firmware until the life devices end of life you get um Perpetual licensing on our Enterprise products and then Prime Care you do want to connect it to in control to get that that license the prim care registration and then some of those features like the database features do expire like like um uh your Fusion Hub license and a few things like that but the the router itself will will work perpetually and and that's important differentiation um there and uh somebody asked if you can get these slides they're published um to anybody that registered so you'll get the slides um and the recording will be published on on YouTube uh Ed you're asking some really good questions not necessarily the focus of this conversation about um but but I'd be more than happy to to to set up a private Tim or we can talk about it off off topic but you're asking really good questions Ed yeah Peter I that that subscript you know like that's the first question everybody asked and I think it's the first question everybody should ask is what happens when your subscription expires right A lot of these routers have subscriptions on them and different things happen when they expire on different vendors and so on peplink when Prim care expires a lot of the things still work right you can still log into the almost all of it yeah almost all of the still work and so you can still log into it you can still change settings a lot of vendors will GR out the entire user interface so you can't change anything even locally right like that it's it's not your router with other vendors with peping gets your router and the only things that will stop working are things that are tied to services that we maintain in the cloud and so it's it's a much different experience with peplink when you when your subscription expires Michael this slide's just for you yeah that's what the road map was um you know peplink I think what's really neat about peplink is we're always evolving right we're adapting to new wireless Technologies we're adapting to new um internet uh Technologies we're we're you know solving customer challenges which makes new features um and and I think there's a lot um coming up uh in the future here just even in the immediate future products that that maybe you've already heard about or that are that are launching here very soon and so um uh Travis I'll leave it to you to to kind of run through it but I'm pretty excited to see the growth peplink and and where we're where we're headed yeah let's dive in there's a bunch of fun stuff to talk about here this this is the big one right so the br1 mini 5G this is and I don't know why we don't have 499 just but this is a this is a 499 5G router with peplink quality so this is the br1 mini um without Wi-Fi so it's um br1 mini core 5G I guess you could call it but yeah this is the the latest and greatest x62 Qualcomm chipset and so this is just a super affordable 5G device for those iot deployments you know not everybody needs the 5G speed but they want that life cycle that longevity that investment protection right they don't want to have to upgrade when 6G comes out right they want to be able to ride that wave you know so if they buy a 4G device or concern is pretty soon in a couple of years that device may be maybe end of life cycle so yeah the br1 mini 5G 499 that's com I think we're taking pre-orders right now the growing word is adapter right I mean that's a very popular word now um is it's a 5G adapter so yeah I you I mean you can't really see it but I've got my I'm doing some testing of some other products and I've got my 5G rout uh mini as my internet source for my competitor routers that I'm evaluating and so playing around you know but so it's a great it's an adapter you just plug this in enable pass through mode if you want and voila you have 5G internet on basically any device and it's incredibly affordable um yeah so this is great with those fixed Wireless plans you know you got like a 100 megabit per second fixed Wireless plan like you said this is the fixed wireless adapter for you it's IP pass through plug it into your existing router all right yes the balance one this is basically this is our new newest generation of an entry-level device and so this kind of takes that um kind of that that Spirit of the surf Soho that we had or the balance 20 over the years this is just that again that entry level device like everybody needs a stable router right like everybody wants a router that's just stable whether they have one internet connection or 10 just give me a good router please and so that's what the balance one does uh of course we've got the speed Fusion capabilities in there so you've got built-in you've got an option with built-in 5G um but a lot of people just have they have starlink or they have a fixed wireless modem from their their 5G provider and so this is that one single great router that you can plug into those those connections that come with their own routers or modems as well so coming soon on that one yeah I I kind of held it up but I kind I have the very first B1 router um I think it someone made this this and and it's actually works in Europe right now but the B1 was originally like this they've now unified the 20 the 20 and the Soho and a couple of the routers um together so um but yeah it's kind of exciting and then we have this B1 which is more like the 20 right and then you have the the b15g which adds that 5G connectivity to it um and so incredibly coste effective connectivity for your Soho applications say I just yeah that's that Connection Manager device right you're going to have a couple different connections they might have their own modems or routers but yeah this B1 is that Connection Manager for you to put them all together um do you see the questions uh Travis look look at the one from and see if I don't know if we're allowed to talk about that or not I'm gonna look at the other ones um J James yeah if um there's a question from Steve about ic2 um oh it's let's just keep going let's let's we got a lot of new stuff to keep showing on the slides like to just get through those at least oh okay we'll go through it next yeah so the next one is our slim antenna this is um it's just a nice flat panel antenna it's an omni antenna so it looks kind of like a directional but um it's it's actually outdoor rated it's ip55 I wouldn't put this on like a moving vehicle necessarily but the eaves of a house or something like that um definitely great device but yeah it's just a better form factor for some some people those Mobility antennas with the pass through design work great if you're mounting it on a vehicle but um if you need it near a window or a wall this flat this flat form factor is much much more um convenient for that type of setup but again this is one of our in-house design antenas so the performance the range is going to be just absolutely excellent um I I actually took one of these and bounced it to my my my um Tim won't let me drill holes in our nicer car so like I have a we have a a Mercedes SUV and I was gonna drill a hole install an 82g on it he goes you're not drilling a hole on the roof of our our Mercedes SUV and I was like well how do I get intenance and then peplink it was really funny because about a week later I get a call I get a an email from uh the peplink wireless engineer and he goes he goes hey can I send you this thing and he sends us the slim adapter and I you know stuck it right in the window of the the the the s UV um and um and it it works really well for for not penetrating the roof no no holes in the vehicle and to be able to just have that connectivity I was very impressed with with the connectivity and capabilities of it yeah yeah putting it on the dash putting it in a a rear window those yeah way better than the the stock antennas but um no holes like you said it came out too late to save my vehicle's roof but not for others I still like drilling holes in the roofs but but Tim wouldn't let me do that one I think this is an awesome router I am yeah this thing I mean it it's shown here in a maritime context but this thing is just so much bigger than any one use case and it it is Big right like this is a bucket right I call this the home bucket yeah it's like a five gallon pale for sure um but yeah like you know we talked about Subaru right like when there's no signal to bond you need bigger antennas right like that's kind of the only option then and so this is that right you've got you've got a router inside but you've got two 5G connections and we've integrated in our Maritime our experience with the maritime antennas and so it's Allin one it's a self-contained unit that you've got just super high gain omnidirectional dual 5G coverage and it worked really really well um I got to go out with uh a public safety agency in Florida um we went out off the shore Key West we took this in a boat and we had it mounted just in the worst possible spot it was like right above the outboard motors just barely above the deck of the boat just not ideal for for long range right um but we still got like at 20 miles we were getting like 80 megabits per second 20 miles offshore and I think we got up to 20 yeah I think we got up to like 22 miles before it cut out so that last like mile or two it trailed off quite a bit but yeah we were getting almost 100 megabits at 20 miles out and if we would have had it up you know I think we would have gotten way more range we install it pretty high and it goes pretty far I we have we have a customer that installed one up high and they were able to go very far offshore uhuh so it was it was pretty neat and we've actually installed these now uh I don't know if Brian's on this call but um we've actually installed these on the tops of of like big manufacturing distribution facilities to act as a backup fiber internet connection um so I mean it's because the the antennas the length and it gives you that higher performance so even if you're not off you know hundreds of miles or dozens of Miles offshore and you're just in a rural area the big antennas mean you have more chance of receiving and sending that signal um or hearing the signal I should say on on a radio um and so it gives you better opportunity for connectivity and lower it lowers the latency increases the throughput I mean it's an incredible router I absolutely incredible yeah and it's you know it's omnidirectional so you don't have to have an engineer sit there and aim it and you know it's a very it's a it's Poe right it's a single Cat 5 cable to install it right yes um I think broadcast Mobile Medical right Mobile Public Safety there's tons of use cases for this thing and yeah like you said fiber failover you know if you've got two fixed Wireless 5G plans on this thing put it on every building you've got and now you've got this super redundant connectivity option and if anybody wants to install these on every building they've got just give me a call right and put a starlink with it too right you've got you got plug a starlink on the poe out you know um I wish our Poe out had enough juice to run a starling but we can figure it out you can still plug a dish in there for sure there you go all right what else do we got I think we're Clos the pots adapter somebody asked a question about this so it's perfect opportunity yeah this is a cool one I mean um it it seems mundane right we're talking about analog telephone lines but hey they're everywhere in our world today still and they're getting shut off left and right they the FCC does not require them to be run by the telephone companies anymore and so they're migrating them rapidly over to voice over LTE and so that's what this device does it just connects your your analog telephone lines to a a voice over LT connection from your your carrier like a T-Mobile Verizon AT&T you're able to just connect a regular old analog phone line to one of those carrier phone phone plans um so fax machines alarm panels elevators yeah elevators yeah all kinds of different devices out there that still use these um so if you you join this call a few minutes after 12 but at 12 o'clock uh we actually signed our new building and I had my like my bro like hey I got a webinar at noon so they were all sitting here in my office and um but the the pots adapter we have to have a phone line for our elevator in the new building and and so the pots adapter is we're going to use that for our fire and our alarm and so it's kind of neat to have that you know plug a T-Mobile voice line in there and boom you're you know where we have voice connectivity and Di you know dial tone for those Legacy systems so pretty excited to to be able to deploy that in a re in a real use case environment what is because we had a about it what is the availability of the pots adapter like what's the time frame for that one um I think it'll be it'll I expect it'll ship in q1 it's we're very very close I know um we're just working through some carrier certifications and things like that so it's I think it's very close we've tested it on everybody out there and um I know there's a there's some nice options they're working on too like a battery backup cable so you know those those are important details for you know more remote types of deployments having the battery backup option there is critical really for some people but yeah it's there just aren't many adapters out there that are ruggedized right there's there's a lot of USB driven stuff and that's just not appropriate yeah it's just not appropriate for an alarm panel or you know these emergency call boxes right like um yeah so this is metal rugged extended temperature they should call it the pots adapter rugged because it's that ruged that we can send the word to Cassie but Cassie um I think there's industry there's an industry analyst that made a report um covering all the vendors out there but there's comment I think that was made about peplink sdw not having realtime cellular health information and so that was just a very incorrect statement frankly um we are the epitome of real-time cellular health and packet routing details and all of those things but yeah for any any folks may be confused about that we make decisions real time and we report on them real time and so that's what this video was but yeah I don't think we need to one second I've paused my screen I'm gonna I'm gonna log into my peplink University and I I'll just actually show that real fast because it is important there's a you know in in control and we have webinars uh videos about in control um but it is interesting that even after years of in control and our cellular features and capabilities that that that even comes up as a question about our real- time analysis and so give me one second I'm just gonna the thing is is it it's included for free there's no EX ra license required unlike some vendors where you have to pay for an additional tier of License to get those cellular reports so yeah it's there and it doesn't cost extra with peplink either so okay so I'm gonna reare should can you see the my in control here my okay so here's my I use this constantly this is definitely yeah it's an amazing tool I I I've used it five years ago as a sales tool for troubleshooting connect AC ity and so I've got my my my uh my Renegade and you can see the GPS kind of tracking there but if I go to um reports and then W quality reports I can pull up my cellular and actually look at the Quality in real time over over time so I've got the real time streaming to me live and then I've got his history here and then I get a GPS map of it so let me pull to the last time it actually moved I think it said couple days ago let me see here eight because it's really cool if you can catch it moving um sorry I drive I drive all the time so I have to catch when last time I drove it there we go okay and then if I go all there you go and so you can see this this map of of of my travels and I can see the WAN quality of that cellular one that you know AT&T mobile or Verizon um Cellular Connection so you can see green and then you you get your quality uh your signal strength your quality and your uh uh latency um and so you've got this map of Quality and then you have this this graph of quality and it's and it's showing you that in real time and I can pull up any Cellular Connection that I have that's active and watch this connection I've even used this for starlink on the ethernet line I can watch that not not it it'll be gray because there's no quality on Starling but I can watch the connections up and down um you can see this particular one was not very good um but that that's the whole point behind it is I can not only see in real time my quality I can also see historically so if it someone calls me and says hey yesterday at three o'clock I was having a problem I can actually pull up yesterday at three o'clock see where they were and what the quality of all of their internet connections are at that time and then I can go in and go to uh reports bandwidth and usage reports and I can see real time bandwidth and usage per Sim which it's off right now so it's not going to be available per minute hourly daily and monthly so I can put my daily go to gigabytes and actually see my my gigabits gigabytes uh transfer and you can see the the the 30th and the the 1 when I was traveling there's my data utilization right there and and so as I was traveling and then it's obviously not traveling so it's it's not using much data right there and so that's the whole idea is I can see and if I'm if if it's on right now I can go to real time and actually see that on a perw basis and so I can click on this I can click on any internet connection I want and see that that throughput on a per way basis and so um incredible real-time capabilities not only real-time performance but you also have Wi-Fi Reports device reports you can see top consumers um you can get realtime event log and firewall logs um that are dumped to the in control so you don't have to log into the router or log into your SNMP um or your your CIS log server whatever it might be you can pull right from in control and so there's a lot of real-time reporting capabilities that happened um I had a customer call me a couple days ago and said hey our we had a router down and I I I just logged in pulled up the reports went to event log said show me system sure enough I saw it rebooted so I enabled Lan and Wan and saw they had a whole bunch of M conflex oh yeah it looks like you have a loop shut fixed the loop problem went away we saw it in the event logs and the the the router stabilized and so um using the event logs they were able to solve that problem in just a few few seconds really um and I was working right for my phone I just literally just logged into in control my phone and pulled that information up and so the reporting capabilities of of peplink and in control 2 are are absolutely amazing you realize how real time it is when you're sitting there working on a vehicle and you're watching the vehicle move down the road as you're send Drive the road I mean I've even done it on airplanes like I'm working on an airplane and I'm watching it like skip across the country and it's just like this is so bizarre you know but yeah it's that real time it really is that Real Time Peter I think we've pretty much wrapped the content and the hour here um oh nextg firewall yeah let's just let's answer this one I and um real fast we got distracted I did not think this would take a full hour and we we certainly did um uh one of the questions we have is does does peping have an next-gen firewall capabilities and um we've had different answers with that but we do have an entire webinar that we recorded on November 14th um about next uh firewalls and network security um and those slides and recordings are on peplink University um you can go to Pink's YouTube channel um but for for most the point peplink has a really good firewall we don't have nextg capabilities but we do have content blocking DPI capabilities and a firewall um and so it's important to understand that we do have security um is some of this realtime uh adaptive response and and I don't like to reinvent anything that's already good there are a lot of good security vendors out there and we can work with those security vendors um so if you have a cloudbased security Appliance we do uh NE um URL uh reporting session reporting uh we support net flow and so and we have an API and so you can integrate Security Solutions into our our cap our firewall capabilities or just see that understand that our firewall has content blocking DPI and application blocking internal out in incoming outgoing internal firewall policies um just not the nextg um capabilities that you can add with a thirdparty uh partner I think that's probably the best quick way to answer that in the essence of time right there's just there's tons of firewall capabilities built in like just watch the webinar watch the webinar it's a whole hour on this topic alone and then um oh go ahead I was just GNA say and it still works after the license expires and it works forever um and the last uh topic was why are we creating Synergy mode and in touch and and so uh Travis I'll pass that on to you yeah I think I mean you talked about Synergy mode before Synergy mode right just plugging different products in together to make something work and you know now we're just making it make sense right so that you don't have to be Peter West to do that um it just all looks like it's one product and so you know Synergy mode is just because it's really powerful when you when you start combining some of these peplink products together and so we just want it to be easy to do that now and so yeah that's Synergy mode just makes it awesome that so you can combine different products together and you know just bolt in more connectivity when you need it in touch we talked about that at the beginning kind of like that is the new way to do out of band management you need to manage things remotely phones cameras printers like all kinds of different things so why not give your technicians a web- based interface that they can log into that you don't have to maintain that it's just a it's a tool it's built into the the device so you can basically change remote support workflows without having to spend any extra money if you've got a peplink you don't Network we had a maritime customer with um that bought an sdx to manage starlink and 5G but then they had another firewall vendor um on the Lan of the sdx and we used InTouch to give the programmer of the firewall access to the firewall over Stars okay in in control in touch to remote control the and program their firewall um because it was on the land of the peplink it it was a really neat use case for in touch and and then the the guy was even looking at the inou in control and InTouch and was pretty impressed with our with that cap that integration and capability yeah let's say you run an email server that runs on a Windows machine right like just pretend and you need to get a technic from that software company in there well you can just give him you can give him an in control account that only has access to that Windows server and they can pull up remote desktop to that machine so it makes in control useful for things everything outside of pepling too and it's a great foundation for maintaining that kind of secure access to people but yeah I think I think we've kind of covered everything so and the um and to learn more about these watch the 8.4 video so we have an 8.4 video talk about Synergy mode and in touch and we have an .3 video where we introduce Synergy mode and really go into details on it but um to learn more about that and we are out of time and so in the essence of everybody's um time I I will thank everybody for joining us on this call if you have questions that weren't answered uh Peter at West networks.com Travis pink.com um if if we aren't the right uh contact for you we'll definitely get you in in in with the right contact whether it's another partner or Regional location or something like that so you can reach out to either one of us we'll make sure you get your question answered and get uh redirected to the proper partner awesome well as always thank you Peter thank you everyone and yeah we've got some cool stuff planned for next year in the excited it's gonna be fun so stay tuned oh hold on can can we talk about January yeah yeah if you want to yeah go for it man so our idea for January and February conferences is to do the PCA training um uh content uh Travis was not able to make it down uh to the summit uh last uh in November we had we announced the PCA and went through the PCA training so we're going to do two special s sessions um two in January and two in February um they're gonna be long we will record them but if you join them you can ask questions provide feedback and things like that and so we're going to be announcing two January sessions and two February sessions um and we're going to go through the entire peplink certified associate program and then offer you the ability to then take those tests um and so if you if you're interested in your PCA uh you're interested in having Hands-On demonstrations and and kind of a walkthrough of the training um please join us in January and February for that and we'll be announcing those those registrations here soon um if you joined us at the summit uh you already went through that uh you can have a refresher if you'd like to but then we'll record that content and it will go live on um you or not live but it'll be posted to YouTube um under the peplink university and so you'll be able to then watch that content as well but it'll be it'll be about 15 hours of content it's GNA be some some pretty intense content going over the uis in control um all the hardware um what's happening in in in 2024 um starlink 5G Etc um and so we invite you to join us for this um special four part series uh January and February for PCA training yeah start your new New Year outright and dig in on all the latest topics and once again if we didn't get to you please send us an email we we' love to answer those questions and so thank thank you very much everybody all right folks take care goodbye bye"}

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "yeah let's get started so today's conversation is going to be about um strengthening your network with uh network security and peplink and so we're going to go over kind of some fundamental layers around um security architecture um and and and once again this is not a CI you know this is not a security uh training as much as it is applying security techniques to peping uh but we're going to go over some of the layers related to peplink uh and security and then how we utilize those capabilities inside of our ecosystem and that's really where we're we're kind of hitting on is is what tools are available inside pep Link's ecosystem to um kind of meet those needs or or sometimes people say to check that box right make make sure we we can check the box to the CEO and the the CFO and say hey we've got this covered you're you're you've got peace of mind and and um with with the infrastructure we have in place absolutely um so we'll start with easy um kind of a a basic idea of kind of like the security layers that we have in place um and and this can adapt based on different network topologies but it's kind of a general overview we have our client layer layer like how we secure um the the client or the endpoint and and peplink is not an endpoint device and so we think about client security when it comes to peplink and it's really about um guest isolation 802.1x captive portals things like that that we would have to to help help the security of the clients but but really a good EDR or something like that that goes on your endpoint is is going to be you know don't this is not in lie of a really good endpoint uh uh a tool I don't want to go into specific vendors but a really good endpoint tool would would help with that as well then we go into the router layer and we could talk about how we um how we connect those clients to the internet and so what firewall policies that's going to be you know our layer seven capabilities you know our firewall rules content block um even things like traffic shaping and and routing that bring thing that that send certain types of application over certain networks um to be able to control the flow in the path that that's happening um and then we can talk about some other cool stuff but I want to I don't want to we I don't want to spoil everything in the in just the first slide so we'll just keep it with the that and then we talk about the SD W layer we can talk about how speed Fusion Itself by the native like by what it does inherently as an incredible level of security to your to your network with or without encryption even I mean just what it does by Nature um and then we can talk about the cloud layer which is going to go right into the end control layer but the cloud layer is how do we secure our Cloud application like Google or Amazon or or Microsoft applications or or other ones but you know how do we secure that um access to those applications and then and then the final is Administration and we use in control too but um and so it's it's it's how we can use in control 2 uh their centralized management capabilities to to to ensure policy compliance um firmware and things like that and that's really sort of the an overview of what we're going to cover today in this webinar yeah I I really like this kind of methodology or this this way to break it up because I think what I see a lot out there is people just get really fixated on one specific security topic and that becomes their perspective on what security is over all and there's so much more than any one thing here and you can't just look at one thing or another you have to look end to end and really get the full scope of it and yeah let's let's start yeah and I think right the way you said that uh Travis is exactly right we got to look at the the the total picture and the flow of traffic it's not just what does my firewall do it's what's my ecosystem what's my infrastructure um and what are we trying to talk to and how do I secure all pieces of that to m any sort of um unwanted threat actors so we talk about the client layer and once again we are not an endpoint protection so what what we really focus on is how those clients connect to the network and so things like guest isolation you know with um with vlans and then the ability to do um intervlan routing and turn that on and off our intervlan firewall policies which I'll show you in a little bit um as well as Wi-Fi client isolation so the ability to actually Layer Two client isolation on our ssids and the idea is if you have a guest that's connecting into your guest Network it should have only access to the internet they shouldn't be talking to anything else but the internet um and so we want to make sure that we can isolate those clients because they're not being monitored by our EDR or some platform and and so when they connected to your guest Network they get on the internet they can do their internet tasks but they're not going to talk to other clients and they're especially not going to get into your corporate infrastructure um and then we have Rogue AP detection so part of once again part of wireless and that client protection is making sure that we don't have any Rogue APS and and I believe Travis you said you had kind of a a use case to talk about that and I I'll defer to you because I think that's a great idea yeah yeah it's um you know it's a feature that's been out there for a long long time and but um what we see or the risk out there that I think is common is especially in like public Wi-Fi networks or or you know guest Wi-Fi networks where you've got like a shared password um one attack that we see is people will set up an access point and mimic all of those settings right they they'll use the same SSID the same encryption key again in a shared key kind of environment and then they can basically intercept any of those clients right you could be at a Starbucks for an example right and you know there's the official Starbucks Wi-Fi but somebody could come in there and set up their own little Wi-Fi access point and start kind of siphoning off clients and you know hijacking them and inspecting their traffic and who knows what they may do right um but we saw this fairly recently with a company who a customer of ours who has a bus wi-fi system so they've got employee shuttle buses and so this is a corporate application right it's not general public but um we had some user reports of you know slowness and things like that and as we dug in we saw oh my gosh there's an there's an access point on this on this vehicle that is not ours right right but it's mimicking those same settings and so we could see that from the Rogue AP report that yeah there's a a hulet Packard access point not a peplink access point and it's broadcasting the same exact network settings and there's no reason that should be on here and so very much a security risk right somebody's trying for some reason to you know intercept those clients and so that's really where that can come into come into play is when you've got people kind of these public settings more often than not where they're trying to kind of inter accept people and again hard to say what their motivations are but not good regardless you would hope that they were just trying to you know increase the cut wireless coverage and use a bridge but either way they shouldn't be doing it yeah you know sometimes it isn't you know nefarious right like you said sometimes it is simply somebody trying to do better but in turn they may have caused a problem or you know Hole by doing that and and and finally we have centralized VLAN management the idea of once again ensuring that those setting that we want to apply can happen centrally which means less op opportunity for mistake if if I have all my my my my inner vand routing and my my fance settings and my my Layer Two isolation I can Cally manage that in our in control that's going to allow us to make sure that we didn't forget a check box at one of our sites or on one of our VLS um and so it just allows for reduce the attack service um you know by by bringing that centralized for you yeah and then we go ahead and then we talk about the router layer and so so the router layer there's a lot here and when we talk about the router layer this is when we get to really show off some of the capabilities that maybe people aren't aware of with peplink and and so it's kind of exciting for example peplink has a robust web blocking content filtering database that's basically given to anybody for free if they're on in control so if you're routers talking to in control you can download this web content filtering database and you simply check a box and you can um and you can show off that you can block content so if I if I'm going to go over to my My Demo router here and I can go to Advanced and content blocking like I can block adaware or pornography or if I have a bigger router this is a br2 but if I have a bigger router I actually have a bigger content database that has viruses malware and and other topics and so right there I have the ability to do content filtering and then I can just check this box and turn it on and now I have the ability to have my filtering database updated automatically from in control sorry um and then we have scalable firewor outbound policy so the ability to um have firewall policies have inbound rules outbound rules internal rules Service rules as well as IDs and do prevention um and then we combine that with our outbound policies to control the flow of traffic so not only can we block it with the firewall we can also change the way it's the direction of the traffic so if I if I have especially if I have a distributed Network and I have you know say America and Europe I could have an outbound policy that says hey send Europe traffic to my European uh Fusion Hub and then send us traffic to my us Fusion Hub or things like that so you have Regional distribution and outbound policy it's a very simplistic idea of that um but I can control the flow of my traffic as well as the allow what's allowed um through the firewall and so uh and I'll demonstrate that in a few minutes as well and uh as well and then we have our DPI uh application filtering so we have our layer seven or our application Level firewall and you think wow I mean this requires a full subscription for most companies and we have it built right into our our router so if I go back to my firewall now right here I have application blocking and a pretty substantial database of of application that we have so I could block I don't know workday or whatever I mean a common one that I block just to throw it on my network because I block bit torn I want to make sure no one's wasting my data plan um and and so a lot of times we you know you can block bitor or other applications but you can also um block uh Google drive if you're not allowing that on your network you also have apple applications here um games and things like that Facebook so you can block unwanted applications and once again there's no outside of in control um updates there's no subscription to this it's built right into your essential care or your Prime Care um which is just really in my opinion really cool but it's also incredibly valuable and and on top of that oh go ahead I was just gonna say I think a lot of this stuff you know this is very much these are very much security features but I think the other thing that I can't help but mention is these are cost management features too right when we talk about metered connection cellular data you know these are ways to protect your pocketbook not only from a security aspect but yeah just from you know I don't want users chewing up Facebook on my you know metered connections so easy way to control that cost component too but definitely so uh so like built right into a router we have an incredibly robust blocking capabilities with web blockings firewall outbound policies and application filtering we also have like I said um a few minutes ago we also have intrusion detection and dos protection um and it's literally you know just a checkbox to turn that on and it's going to look for that Rog traffic um and then what's really cool about peplink is our security patches and if you're aren't aware of this and and I mean I think anybody on this webinar should be but if you're not aware of this there's no gating for our our firmware there's a security patch you don't need to put a serial number you don't have to have a warranty you don't have to have Prime care you don't have to have essential care you can go to pink.com click support go to Firmware download that firmware get that security patch for your equipment so as long as it's a a supported a a supported device which can last for years and years um as long as we're still releasing firmware for that device you're going to get that free of charge um with or without a warranty so you're always going to know you have the latest security patches regardless of the state of your warranty and I I think that's just really neat that peping does that I think this is such a big deal and I I think it's really overlooked because so many people look at you know they they go out and they buy a device right and they they look at the day one cost of that device and they buy it today and then they use it for five plus years right and how many times are they updating it right how many security patches are being applied you buy a $200 cellular router that's you know maybe cheaper than a peplink br1 mini but I'm guessing 90% of those never ever get a single firmware update you know maybe they get one maybe maybe right but there's all kinds of new vulnerabilities every day like those things are not safe and that that's not a good way to go about it and so yeah not only do we make it easy but the life cycle that we support and release these patches is just unprecedented you don't you won't find a vendor out there that's going to support a product and a platform much longer than peplink it's it's really it's really unique from what I've seen in the last 20 years in the industry and on that especially with the cost savings side of it everything that I just demonstrated I demonstrated locally on the device which means those features will last forever you might not get updates if you don't renew your warranties for the databases but the functionality the ability to block that application is Perpetual um and so we with nothing I've shown off yet has is in in control um and we're going to get some cool in control stuff but I mean it I mean everything that we've demonstrated is Perpetual the application blocking content blocking the the security updates the IDS and Doos um none of that requires any in control other than updating the databases on the device and um and and so once again router obviously is key for us then we talk about our the ability to do W toan links using our 256bit AES encryption so now you're talking about kind of like getting into speed Fusion a little bit where we can we can actually split data up we can use multiple links we can split the traffic up which makes it really difficult to attack if I have four links and I'm doing four different 256bit encrypted tunnels or connections um to my to my infrastructure it's going to be really really difficult to attack that those connect that link because they're going to have to cture all of that across all four links and then hack all four um encrypted tunnels just to see um and hopefully they got something right but so we we've had some pretty pretty successful um analysis of that but it's incredibly secure the ability to to have four independently encrypted tunnels that then work together as one bonded unit or one load balancing unit depend on how you're doing failover whatnot but to work as one unit to to increase that security between your sites or to your Cloud applications yeah I think if anybody who's taken some security courses one of the first things you hear about is a man INE middle attack right somebody kind of sitting in the middle and intercepting traffic well you need a lot of people in the middle in this in this case with speed Fusion right like yeah it becomes just exponentially difficult for that type of attack to even be possible with with the way speed Fusion breaks traffic up and and uses these different paths and different encryption keys so yeah this is this not mention it's exponentially I mean it's exponential if you have well it's not really expon gu it's linear but it sounds cool when it's exponential it it gets increasingly diff more difficult because if you have an hd4 with four 5G modems and you have one internet connection at your office that's going to create four tunnels if you have two internet connections at your office that's going to create eight tunnels you know so you know if you have three tun connections that's going to create 12 tunnels and so it makes it gets increasingly more difficult the more internet connections you have involved in this design and a lot of companies are picking peplink because of our multi-way capabilities so you a lot of the our customers have you know two internet connections a cable and a DSL or a fiber and a cable or two fibers plus their mobile sites where they're maybe running 5G and and cable services or multi 5G and cable or DSL and fiber and so when you take all those internet connections and you com them together you create an incredibly difficult um Network to to breach on the WAN side that man in the middle are trying to listen on the pipes yeah and you know if you look at any other VPN right IP SEC or you know these these software clients or you know other like wire guard they're a single connection to a single connection with one encryption key it's just not the same it's not even close to the same right this is a whole another category of difficulty to to break and intercept and then to make it even more complicated we do packet based bonding packet based balancing and so we take this incredibly secure tunnel and then we distribute these packets across them all so a lot of times you might think people do load balancing where the session one goes on Wan one and session two goes on Wan two and a lot of our you know other products will load balance over multi-wan and then have tunnels established we actually break that up so your session your your Zoom or your your file upload or your bank account session is actually being broken up into multiple packets and doing packet level bonding um which just further increases the difficulty for attack in the middle there yeah so and then we talk about Security on on a different level we talk about the sdwan side and that is really security by keeping your network up and running um helping maintain reliability and resiliency so when we talk about sdwan we talk about bonding and load hot failover and and resiliency of your infrastructure because if you can't talk to your your sim you can't get your analysis your Network's down you have different levels of security you have to worry about and so when we then add the the sdw side of this with the ability to fail over from NLS to cable or DSL or aggregate all them together we further increase your uptime and your resiliency keeping your infrastructure going yeah and I think that's a good point too because you know again security a lot of the time we talk about people like targeting your information trying to steal your information well a lot of the times it's not they're not trying to steal anything right they're just trying to shut you down and disrupt you and you know that's the denial of service and those kinds of things so again like you said this protects you against that too because there's so many different ways you can keep moving even if they attack one provider or another provider you've got I mean I took security uh years and years and years ago um but I mean isn't it CIA like confidentiality uh integrity and accessibility or availability in the CIA of security oh that's the it's been a while too so so we talk about the availability of it making sure that we keep our infrastructure available is is one of the pillars of security uh fundamentals at least um and and then everybody's moving to the cloud and we talk about okay well now we're in the cloud and and I kind said this earlier you know the the cloud layer is merged with our in control platform you know so we have Administration in the cloud and we have Cloud security um but the one of the things like if you think about password management a lot of times people will will actually have shared passwords between their devices well within control you can actually randomly generate passwords for each of your devices as well as create complex usernames that are pushed down centrally um giving you the ability to make make sure that your devices can't be compromised by an employee that maybe has a a list of your a list of those passwords that you never change so your switches and your APS and your routers they're local management you can randomly generate passwords and anytime you have a change of of uh employees or you have a change of just you could do it randomly at you want you can just randomize and regenerate all those passwords with a checkbox and so literally you're managing the access to these devices on your network very well because now you can randomly change the passwords no device has the same set of passwords um and then you can establish complex usernames which is part of PCS sets anyways is making sure you don't have just admin as the username you know you want to have the you know like P like University admin or something like that not not just the word admin or administrator and and so and then uh you don't even need those passwords because you have in control which has two Factor authentication and the ability to then log into those devices and so really you're generating complex passwords is a way of just forting you're basically mitigating people on your network from just snooping around and accessing stuff they're not supposed to access I I I love these tools because I think insecurity there's this kind of like conventional wisdom of um there's security and there's convenience right and you know the more convenient something is the less secure it is and the more secure it is the less convenient it is and these tools really push that scale back because these are tools designed to make security convenient right you can like you said randomize a thousand a thousand different routers passwords like that and that's convenient and secure and so we're really giving power back to those administrators so that it is convenient to be secure and not so much of a headache to behave in a in a you know proper way to keep yourself protected exactly and so you know the ability just to manage that is is centrally in in control is incredibly power powerful and it's really easy I mean let me see here if I I could demonstrate that for you for anybody that's running in control so if I go into my my network I go to settings device system [Music] management and so right here I can have this device web admin and here I could like you know peplink University admin and then I can assign a random password a shared password um or I can the device manage that password locally I hit save and then it's going to push out that that random password and once I do that I can say reassign a new password we had an employee change you be part of your your your your employee transition procedures we have an employee change or every every 30 days or whatever you just check reassign a new password hit save changes and it's going to generate a new password if you need to then you can download a copy of these admin passwords for out of band management the Network's offline you don't have in control you need to log in locally you can do that um and then additionally we can configure how can access these I can access these on as SSL on the land only from a specific VLAN so if I have a management VLAN or an IT users VLAN I can actually say this the Land Management of these devices can only happen from from a specific VLAN if I want and you can push that out throughout the infrastructure and I'll show you the other stuff in a minute but I mean incredibly useful and and so we talked about we talked about the local router but now we get to talk about how we can do this in the cloud with in control and our Cloud operations and so we think about the administrative layer of this in the cloud and we have tenant segment segmentation so with our Fusion Hub Appliance you can actually create VR apps and then have complete tenant segregation so if you're an MSP or an mssp or something like that and you want to create a hosted solution for centralized firewall or IP Management in a fusion Hub you can actually spin up multiple vrs FS have multiple different customers with conflicting subnets use your Fusion Hub to um in in your Cloud infrastructure and you can have that distributed right you could have like one in East Coast one in West Coast one in Europe Etc um and you can point your clients to those that the brfs designated to them or if you're you know just a large organization with a lot of business units and you want to keep your broadcast group separate from your research group or some variant thereof you could do that as well um and then we have once again moving that security up into the cloud or the administration layer we now have comprehensive traffic security so I I showed you on the router how we had the ability to do traffic security but let's say you have 150 sites and you don't want to log into the router turn on adaware and PR and uh malware blocking um on each and every router so there's a couple things that we have that you can do once once again in device set settings device system management we have the ability to turn on all of our logging and centrally manage that and force it on all of our routers so you can turn on um URL logging session logging um send events to remote CIS log server then down here you can turn on netf Flow and capture your your I V5 v9 and IP fix and send that to your s and so now with with three checkboxes and a couple IP addresses all all of your sites everywhere in the world are now going to your siia and if somebody changes that locally Factory resets the router it's going to come online it's going to connect to in control it's going to start doing it again they can't wipe that setting locally because in control is going to push that down so as long as it's in your organization and your management that setting is being pushed um yeah and if you deploy a new system it's no big deal right you've got 50 rers yeah you just make one change and youve you've just now migrated right it's not that huge effort any anymore we had a we had a client actually that's not really related to to policies but we had a client that had um was using um sfc protect and they kind of outgrew the 200 megabits per second limit as well as some of the bandwidth capabilities they wanted to switch to SF speed fusion um going to a fusion Hub they wanted that dedicated bandwidth and and centralized firewall in and well I guess it is kind of security related there centralized firewall of the fusion Hub and so literally we just went speed Fusion click turn on it set set up the fusion Hub and literally in about 9 seconds moved a 180 some sites from sfc to a a dedicated private Fusion Hub then centrally managed the outbound policy pushed it to this the the fusion Hub instead of speed Fusion protect and we were instantaneously now on this Fusion Hub and it took maybe 10 minutes max and and so that Central management is incredibly powerful that's cool yeah oh let me show you the sorry comprehensive security back I started talking about logging and got got distracted so then if you go to network settings and then firewall rules we can turn on manage firewall rules and create a rule set and so here I have my outbound firewall rules my inbound firewall rules my internal firewall rules my intrusion detection do so I can make sure that's enforced on all of my set routers and then my local service and then if you go to the right here content blocking all of your content blocking can now be managed centrally inside in control with 2.13 so now I have the ability to to block Hulu or block bit torrent and things like that and have that applied to every router at the exact same time I no longer have to log in and manage my content my web blocking individually per router I can now do this right from the content blocking tab under firewall rules and so here I can block my adware my malware um I can block uh bit torent which is just sort of my default block there um I can tell it to update the database automatically and in control I can exempt user groups if I need to exempt subnets if I need to customize domains that I want to block if I need to block a particular domain or exempt domains from we blocking so if I've got something that's blocked in the database that I don't want blocked I can add it to the Exempted domains list um and all of that now once you check that box and turn it on just goes to all of your routers um and you can say you I don't want to go all my routers that only goes some my R it's not a problem you can use tagging and apply these firewall rules to a specific tag like Branch versus data center so I can have a data center firewall policy a branch firewall policy a mobile unit policy a fleet policy and each of these policies can have different rule sets based on what they need to accomplish or what their mission is I think tag such a powerful component of this because you know it it's not just those firewall policies right like you talked about earlier the VLS can flow into that same tag and all sorts of Branch specific or mobile specific elements can all be waterfall with one tag and then you've got one policy to update and it's amazing yeah and when paired with in control we now have the ability to do destination based on sass and region so you can create inbound and outbound policies based on sass and regen now and so I can say allow Microsoft Office but block every country out other than you we're in the USA so no no president there but block everything except for the USA and then so literally if Microsoft has a server in the Netherlands or in in in the UK or somewhere else if I'm if it's part of my Microsoft Office that I'm allowing I can allow that access but block everything else um and so we can combine and now that is unique to in control that's not going to be local um those are databases that are driven by the uh in control platform and and so those SAS and the region is an in control firewall only so if you log into your rou and go Hey where's region and SAS just remember that's that's built into in control and but you can make outbound policies and inbound policies based on Source SASS and region so you can allow inbound connectivity on P 443 from your country and only your country um so if it's outside of your country then it's not going to work um and so because a lot of times right now especially with least used permissions the idea is I don't want to allow people just coming in on Port you know I I still see people that use like RDP and about access which sort of a probably a security no no but they still do it and so at least you can limit that to your country um or you can create a grouped Network which is a group of IP addresses and limit that RDP to a specific group of IP addresses and so you have SAS region and group networks that really allow you to F tune who's allowed to come into your network or where you're allowed to go out and then on and then in addition we have the content blocking and application capabilities um and then security patches we talked about security patches being easily available on for free on pink.com but once again if you have 150 routers you might want to want to download that firmware then log into 150 routers and update them so now you can go to settings firmware policy and you can make sure that all of your routers in your entire organization your switches or your APS it's not just outers but all of your devices are running the latest and greatest firmware I can simply just see my router choose the latest firmware tell whether I want to do this immediately based on a schedule maybe my schedule window is from 2 am to 4 AM um or if I enter a Gein so if I have GPS capabilities I can actually say only update that router like my fleet vehicle when it enters the depot um and so based on your needs you could push out this firmware um uh to suit that mission but the idea is now I don't have to make sure I don't have to worry that my routers or my switches or my APS aren't running the lasest security patches or I missed one because I was logging in updating those locally now you can you can enforce it that my routers and my organization are going to run this particular firmware set and it might not be the latest firmware maybe there's a special firmware or or a a a unique need where you don't want to push the latest firmware so you can enforce that hey my organization's going to standardize on this particular firmware um which is also really nice because then people can't accidentally push the wrong fir yeah and I think there's one little thing on this page that I think matches up with what you're just talking about really nicely that little warning right below the table there devices not following the policy so you know if you're a large organization you don't just blindly roll out new firmware right that's that's a that's a rookie mistake if you've got a hundred or a thousand sites but you might want to start testing it right you need to start testing it and so you can have this Global policy but then you can override that on a unit byun basis yeah that you can incrementally test those firmwares and get them into production and and do that safely and this tool reminds you like hey you've overridden that policy and that's not going to listen to what we're just doing here right now so you've got that you could have aund routers here that do that too and it'll tell you every single router that's not follow following the group or the organization policy that's been manually overwritten on the on the local device it's really easy for things to fall through the cracks if you don't have little tools like this to you know look over your shoulder and just make sure that you've got everything everything covered and then I mean no no single platform is act is is complete and we know that I mean we know like we I mentioned earlier like you might have an EDR you might have a a a cloud provider you might be using zcall or something else and so third party security integration is key um and and I'm throw fluency out there on this because fluency sponsored the summit last week and and they've done some really cool API stuff with uh in control um and so we worked with with the security vendors and we can actually send the net flow those URLs to to third party security vendors you can create GRE Wan tunnels that go to zscaler and you can outbound policies to send traffic to that zscaler um and and anybody in any other platform as well but um these are just my use cases that I've done recently and and so the idea is we we not only have a comprehensive security solution but if you want to make that even more robust we support that as well you can then integrate with your third party Solutions whether it's going to be DNS proxy um forwarding DNS requests to your your third part DNS uh provider whether you want to do um the net flow and and apid driven capabilities with with a thirdparty security Appliance um or you want to do Port mirroring and send that to your your on-prem security Appliance or you want to like go to like a SE third party firewall like zscale or something like that um we support all those capabilities whether it's a GRE or IPC or even open bpn when I do a lot of Health Care um and my Healthcare Providers have incredibly robust firewall and they do not want to rip down an entire corporate firewall system and integrate peplink SK Wan um as much as I would love to see them rip out their firewall and replace it that's not easy to do on an organization especially if they're doing a POC or you're implementing or third you know trying to work with other platforms and so peplink and um we've done some really good capabilities where we integrate or work with customer networks and so a lot of times if someone's new to this the way I explain it is Imagine ordering an NLS circuit from from a provider and they're going to give give you an NLS switch and they're going to integrate that into your network so you're going to have your your your NLS switch is going to go out to the internet um and connect your your branch sites and then it's going to Route into your corporate Network and if you think about the fusion Hub or our balance router if you're integrated with an existing Network as as an MLs sdwan or an NLS switch over cellular what you're doing is you can actually take that peplink router or the the fusion Hub and integrate it with your existing infrastructure and just enable routing protocol whether it's a static route OSF or bgp and then advertise that into your network this allows you to extend your infrastructure with peplink sdwan without replacing your firewall um and you can simply use a default route like 0.0 that goes to your your corporate firewall and now you have the ability to secure your branches with peplink but having your existing firewall and honestly this is a huge cost savings we have a customers that go wait a second I only need to have one firewall yeah you have one firewall we do a default route 0000 Z to your firewall and now all of your branch offices are using that one firewall policy and so we've had some really large Hospital systems and some pretty big uh uh big Enterprises use this capability to extend the infrastructure um without replacing their existing firewall or working with their existing firewall and then I've had other customers use it as a migration strategy so basically working with the firewall you you set up your branch it's once you get everything migrated over then decommissioning and making the peplink the default gateway and having your your your main firewall um and so we've used it from both ways as a m migration strategy and as an interoperable interoperability strategy that might be too much for this topic but if you have more questions about this please we'd be I'd love to share it with you I mean I think it's good because it it speaks you know we've got a product range right we've got like2 to $300 products and we've got like $30,000 products and those go into very different environments and get used in very different ways and you need different tool sets and you know you're going to be an allinone in one use case and you're going to be you know using a third party solution in another use case and yeah this just speaks to the ability to play both of those yep it just allows for for less stress implementations if your security departments you know maybe has hesitant you can say well we can play with this with without replacing our firewall um and I just think that's need of peplink that we we built that capability to just interoperate regardless of of the of the platform or the environment um this really belongs on the uh that that client security side slide um this is actually goes more into client security but um peplink does support 802.1x and we support it on our our switches and on our Wi-Fi so whether it's a WPA Enterprise um or wpa3 Enterprise and or 802 1X on your switch ports um we do support uh U centralized authentication with with radius servers whether it's the access point or the switch um and then finally we have hardening techniques that we try to stand by and that we support and so it's that in itself is probably an entire course um and the idea is to make sure that in this webinar that you understand that we have this capability um and we we Implement them properly and so we talk about our hardening techniques um IDs I showed you how to turn that on um the IDS inside either the local firewall or an in control um dos prevention once again that checkbook that checkbox IDs and dos prevention are kind of one and the same um and then firewall hardening I showed you how to implement um firewall policies in in control or on the local router to make sure we can block in all inbound traffic and outbound traffic um one thing I do want to show about that is we talked about integration in the firewall rules if you want to go to firewall rules and you create a rule sometimes the default rule is going to be could be either allow or deny so I can say you know either allow this traffic or deny any any but if I click on this default rule there's no auditing checkbox so I can make my default or allow or deny but there's no way to enable logging here so a lot of customers I G do this on the uh the inbound so I could I could say my my inbound I want to deny but that's not going to log inbound STS so I can create a new rule and I can say inbound deny logging and then I can make the same rule any any deny event loging enable now I have this rule that's going to enable event logging and still deny all traffic this is going to create those events in my firewall log that then gets dumped up to my S and so so if I if I am running third party and I need to see those event logs for the deny traffic or the allow traffic however you want to do it um you can you can do that right there um and so uh if you want that logging and then every additional rule like for example if I said did an outbound I don't that uh if I did an outbound Rule and I could say um allow uh you know uh my my country and I could say destination region my country allow enable event bloging so so I can allow I can enable the the the service allows me to allow that traffic out but I'm still going to log the traffic I want to see where I'm going what services and ports are being used and then I can create that default deny I say then deny um other countries or deny all and I click that deny and then I'll and event event logging so I'm allowing access to my country and then I'm blocking everything else but I'm logging those those attempts so I can see what's happening um and so it just allows you to get that fine-tuning of of centralized management but also the event logging that allows you to dump that to your platform um and then I showed you DPI in layer 7even I showed you how to use application blocking and so the idea of being able to block bit torrent or Facebook or other applications you might not want um and be able to centrally push that um I showed you SAS the ability to choose SAS as a as a either a source or a destination in our firewall and outbound policies and then what I didn't show you which is really cool is we have a very robust API and if you have have programmers if you go to a internet browser here we go to peplink in control API just Google that sorry um you'll get this in control 2 API doc doation and you can click on that and actually read all the in control apis but we had a a security vendor take our net flow and our URL logging and our session logging dump that through their platform and then create API responses that automatically added firewall rules to block malicious traffic so you can actually block uh malicious uh actors in real time with the peplink in control API and a supported Sim and that is really really cool um and we have an in control API and then we have a balance API so once again you know if you don't want to use in control and you just want to do it yourself boom peplink router API documentation right there you can download the router the API and you can build it right into your router and bypass in control and I I I I think it's weird but I also think it's really cool that pep allows for that um to be able to just be independent of of the cloud or connected to the cloud um and then especially if you're in the retail Market or the PC you know you're doing credit card transactions pcss is incredibly important um we have a a PCI DSS guide once again you can just Google ping PCI DSS we have a work guide but um we support that hardening built right into our stuff so you make sure you have VLAN isolation make sure you have firewall blocking that blocks your your point of s system from only to only access its required authentication you know authenticators whoever's doing your your your credit card processing um and then isolating that on the network and so we can we are fully compliant or supportive of PCI DSS as well as other um Proto security protocols as well but uh but you know you can Harden our firewalls um down so we start out open um that supports our small businesses and our our small user base but if you're if you're a retail or an Enterprise and you go I want to lock this thing down uh we definitely support that and you can do it very easily in just a few check boxes especially if using control um I showed you I showed you content blocking already I kind of skipped ahead on a few of those I got excited but uh we have we have content blocking um once again application and category based blocking um our firewall rules uh inbound outbound and so outbound is anything from a land VLAN uh VPN user out to out of Wan interface or or speed Fusion tunnel nope outside a w interface inbound is from a Wan interface into a landan VPN or or or VLAN internal is land VLAN to speed Fusion or other V vlans and lands that's going to be your your internal traffic and then you have your IDs and dos and then you have your local Services local services are things like speed Fusion handshakes so if you want to secure what's allowed to talk um to to negotiate a speed Fusion tunnel handshake that that's going to be your local service firewall rules as well as your DNS server and other things like that so in our Wi-Fi network um we have actually the ability to kick off users that might are you don't want to have so in our router you can actually check um you can actually see in your Client List and click them off but we also have the ability to automate and block traffic and so this is an example of using in control to block traffic access to malicious sites using our content filtering um and then once again uh we have dhp snooping and our switches so you can actually if you don't know what dhp snooping is basically create trusted and untrusted ports so what a common use of uh attack or even even just kind of people messing up is they'll plug like a you know they'll go to Best Buy thinking they're buy they're they're improving the the their Wi-Fi coverage we talk about Rogue APS well they'll buy like a linkis router they'll plug in get into the network and boom they broadcast DHCP on your network and so peplink switches have DHCP snooping and so you can actually take the the peping switch make your default ports untrusted which means it won't it'll allow you to request a dhp but not respond to a DP request on on an untrusted port and then your trusted ports are the the uplinks to your DP server whether that's the peplink router your your active directory server wherever you're handing off DHCP you basically create a trusted path from your switches to your dhp server if somebody plugs in an unauthorized dhp server on your network it won't be able to respond to requests so it can receive the request but it won't be able to respond to those requests um securing Our Guest ssids we talked about SSID security um there's a checkbox that you can actually block all private IPS and so if you're connecting to our SSID whether it's like a br2 pro 5G or or APS when you're creating your cert your um uh your SSID you have this this guest protect feature and so you can block all priv private IPS or you can create custom um subnets or block exceptions so if you have like a you want to block all private IPS except a printer and you want to allow them to print to a to a printer but but not access anything else you can actually put the printer's IP address there in the block exception and and it'll it'll be allowed to print and then you can see down below the very bottom of that there's block pet VPN this ensures that if you have if you've accidentally broadcast OPF over your your guest Network you can make sure those guest networks can't can't talk to your your remote sites um and then we also have the captive portal with authentication like radius um and so you can set up um captive portals with radius authentication as well oh and I've already done the demos I did that during it so I got I got ahead of myself a little bit guys I apolog I get I get super excited um I was trying to get I we're coming near the end of the hour so I wanted to get through those last bit of slides um but we do have some time for a few questions if if we have some have you been answering those uh traps already or I haven't there's only a couple here um I love let's see guest access to well I just said that so someone asked how to give a guest network access to a local printer um you could do uh you could either if you don't block them on the land then they'll have access to a printer but you could do block exceptions now if you want them to access a printer on your corporate Network say you have the guest Network on a corporate Network and you want them to access then what you have to do is allow inter VLAN routing so don't don't block interent VLAN routing and then use the internal firewall rules so basically say my guest Network can access this particular printer or this group network of printers and then block everything else so my guest Network IP address subnet um allow grouped of print printers and then my guest Network deny everything any um on the internal firewall rules this will allow your guest Network to talk to printers um that are maybe in your corporate network but not able to talk to anything else but in order to do that you have to allow the interv land routing and you have to allow um you have to at least have a ex block exception for those printers on the SSID um somebody asked a question about content blocking um I I would open a ticket with um your your partner and or if you need help uh just reach out to us U that's more of a tech support issue than a a how-to um someone asked if we have white papers on existing firewalls i' I've created some documentation on my LinkedIn profile I think we have a white paper on that somewhere online um but but if you want um we do have a that kind of a guide if you reach out to Travis or myself um we can we can send you kind of our guide on on integrating with with existing fireworks so if you want to block users from from accessing a particular SSID um that's going to be actually in your um Access Control list for the SSID so let me go to my in control so someone asked how to block particular users from accessing a specific SSID so when you're creating your ssids um down here uh you have Mac filtering none U deny all except the listed allow all except the listed or radius Mac authentication so I can say on my Mac filter I can say um deny all accept and then I can have an access control list in in control or I can list the Mac addresses right here so I could make an access control list under network settings Access Control list list all my my my laptop my devices and then just choose that access control list right here which can also be applied to firewall rules and outbound policy so it's better to to do that in there or I can list the a the Mac addresses here or we can say radius Mac authentication and put in a radius Circle um so if you want to restrict which users can can talk another thing that we that's really cool about um ssids and security which I thought was a really neat thing that someone did one time is our captive portal if you create a VLAN like a like a office vand and you want to restrict to office users and you don't want to set up 802.1x so kind of like the the non the non 802.1x method you can create a new capture portal then you can make it email authenticated then right down here you could say domain so I could say only allow domains peplink unit I'll just say pink.com so we go pink.com so now you have a captive portal this is applied to your VLAN someone plugs into your network they're going to get get a captive portal they're going to have to put in a p a pink.com email address if they don't have a peplink do.com email address and get that that that token they can't connect to your network think of this as a a a Poor Man's Guide to to 802.1x you could basically secure your network to to anybody that has access to email um so it's kind of you know I've had users use this as two-factor authentication I've had users use this as a way of doing um security without needing a radius server um but basically you can you you have your VLAN set a captive portal on it say company name access they put in their email address Peter pink.com well I'll say Travis because I don't have a pink.com but Travis at pink.com he then would then get a token in his email type that in and then be able to log into the network but without without that typing that in he wouldn't access wouldn't have access to that Ving so you can use this type of methodology as well to restrict users on your Wi-Fi or your SSID to to only your domain so kind of a cool feature that was implemented um and it's actually really really easy way to implement just a basic level of security on your on your Wi-Fi or a vlink and our questions just bombarded I don't know if we're gonna have time to go through all these so let me see here um you someone asked if a user with a VPN can bypass firewall rules um actually you can create a firewall world to block vpns um and so then they wouldn't be able to bypass it I mean it's pretty easy to block vpns um especially on the application layer side um but that's where like DNS security so like making sure you have DNS proxy you have firewall rules that block the DNS servers uh or the the VPN users um but yes if you allow VPN then then they could bypass those firewalls but then once they do that then they'll have hard time accessing your corporate Network as well so a couple things people asking wouldn't it be better for I'm giving General ideas of the Technologies so it's not best this is not a best practices conversation this is a showing you the tool so whatever you see fit in your design definitely that's what you should Implement um so this is not a best practices webinar so that's just GNA be a general answer to about seven or eight of those emails uh questions um so someone asked a really good question U do we offer software for VPN yes we do um we have open VPN and l2tp VPN as remote user so in our routers um if you go to the advanced tab remote user access and turn this on you can actually allow non peplink VPN and not speed Fusion so you have l2tp VPN and openvpn support and then you can create user accounts here um uh and and some routers um support a radius and active directory as well but basic routers will have open VPN with local user accounts and then others will have radius and then you have your l2tp VPN and once again my br2 has just local accounts but bigger routers will have radius and active directory authentication so if you are using um speed Fusion connect you do need an outbound policy we actually have an outbound policy webinar where we talked about speed Fusion connect and outbound policies so if you go back a couple months um of webinars under peplink university or pep Link's uh YouTube channel you can actually look up that outbound policy um webinar um so U somebody asked a question about GPS uh yes uh you can uh we have um a GPS webinar that we did I think two months ago where we did the GPS Fleet Management um so once again youtube.com uh and then go to peplink or or if you search peplink University I've Consolidated all these videos into one peplink University playlist and you can watch the GPS demonstration and if you have questions just let us know uh Tim uh at uh sorry to reach Travis or myself you can email Travis pink.com or Peter West networks.com you should you should give me a peplink address but um Travis pink.com or Peter West networks.com and um we can send you um any documentation um as well as um reference materials if you need it you had one once Peter I don't know where that went I H I had evangelist at but I don't know if that I don't know I don't know if that works or not I'm not I'm not exactly sure someone could email that and see if it works but I used to have evangelist at at pink.com I remember that the USA connections then that is the outbound policy someone asked if they an outbound policy but either way if you if you're creating a tunnel you need outbound policies so but we have exhausted all time I just want to thank everybody so much and um and have a great day all right um so thank you awesome yes thank you folks thank you again Peter one year"}

just push this ball down the hill and and get get going here so Peter I'm just going to hand it over to you I know you've got a lot of things that you want to show folks and you know troubleshooting something we all have to do so yeah thankfully plenty of great tools and yeah Professor p take it away yeah I I'm gonna preface this that um this uh troubleshooting is a lot of information shoved into a very short period of time and and so um if you are interested if you like this we do have the peping tech Summit coming up here next month where we go through the PCA training but this is a a snippet of our module 4 training that we've decided to share with everybody and kind of make a a university video to kind of give some ideas of Q&A and and and um and open up the ideas of the tools available for troubleshooting pep links because there is a lot to our stuff and we keep every new feature set we have more capabilities we got to we got to have the tools to troubleshoot the different connectivity scenarios and so um anyways I just wanted to um preference that with there's a lot in this so I expect that you're going to download the recording afterwards and watch it again um and just to to keep up with uh all the different slides that we have um the learning objectives of today and this once again it's kind of like pulled right from the PCA training that we did for Frontier and we we're doing it at the PTS as well but basic troubleshooting so in other words Hardware based uh feature sets that we're going to have to uh to help you with uh visually U troubleshooting the connect the capabilities or the status of the router and then uh the tests and and tools that we have for optimizing and and validating your network so that's sort of where we are the the physical hardware and then the tools that we have to troubleshoot you know speed fusion and connectivity way performance you know is my speed Fusion equal to my way performance that kind of stuff yeah that makes sense yeah so you're G to have the LCD screen that's on the balance routers and some people freak out if you notice when you first starts up there's that black bar that's okay for a few seconds um if if you have a permanent black bar that's going to be bad um and then another funny one that people will complain about is when it boots up they'll see um maintenance and status and I'll show that in just a second it kind of f fails through it here right right booting and then you're going to have system status and maintenance that's your standard that that means the router's booted up so if you see system status and maintenance that's that's good that means that router's up and it's and it's and it's booted up on the left hand side you're going to have the max routers and you're gonna have your power your status Wi-Fi one Wi-Fi 2 or Wi-Fi only if it's like a a br2 pro 5G or something like that and then your cellulars one two and then additionally potentially three and four if those are on solid green that means they're good if they are um flashing if the cellulars are flashing that means it's detected a SIM card and it's trying to connect to the internet um so it's going to go boot up power status and then the cellulars are going to start flashing which means they've initialized and they're starting to try to connect and then they should go solid green if you only have one Wi-Fi like this one Wi-Fi 2 is flashing or or starting up there if you only have one Wi-Fi that means you're in APW mode that means one of your APS is being used for Wan and the other AP is being used for uh a Wi-Fi access point if you see two green lights Wi-Fi one and Wi-Fi 2 that means you're in APAP mode that means both modems both uh modules are actually being used for Wi-Fi access point and so if you try to do Wi-Fi when it's going to say this this uh Wi-Fi is disabled and so if you want the best Wi-Fi performance 2.4 and 5 GHz you you should see two solid green lights for the Wi-Fi so in the dashboard we're going to have Wan status speed Fusion status Wi-Fi access point status device information and your ipvpn status if you have that and so if we look at our different connecting I actually recorded that yesterday this initializing connecting obtaining IP address connected C created like a little GIF image there to show the status of a healthy boot up so it's going to reset it's going to initialize it's going to connect it's obtain IP address and then it's going to go on to your T-Mobile that is a healthy startup of a of a cellular module but we have ethernet lands and um cellular ws and so here's a kind of what each of these different ones means not no cable detected that would be applying to ethernet W and that means it's not detecting a a network Conn an ethernet cable plugged in so that means you either have it plugged in and then the other side of that cable is not plugged in or you're getting an MTU mismatch or it's not negotiating but either way it's not detecting that cable um so you need to troubleshoot the physical cable Andor the Remote device status connecting which means it's detected the cable or the the SIM card and it's negotiating and trying to establish how it's going to connect obtaining IP address means it's connected it's established the the negotiation with either the carrier or the the the network the ethernet and it's trying to get an IP address from from the from the provider that's going to do that wfil DNS uh Wan failed ping test or DNS or HTP test that means that the DNS server provided either St statically or via DHCP is not um pingable so that's what it's going to do with a ping test by default or DNS test um a lot of people will just turn that off go oh it shows connected we're good maybe but there's still a problem if the router on the ethernet W or the cellular W can't access or ping out the internet make sure that that's not just your firewall policies that you're plugging into or make sure that it's uh that's an actual known uh event don't just disable the health check and go oh look it shows connected um no SIM card detected is very similar to no cable detected and so what we mean by that is there it's not detecting that you've installed a SIM card this could just be that you've installed the SIM card after the router is booted up and just didn't when you plugged it in it just didn't trigger that that detection sometimes a simple reboot will fix that or there's a Reload Sim option that you can do as well um and so paying attention to that as well no device detected this means the cellular module is reset and it's waiting for it to respond um and it's part of sim detection so the no device detected is kind of a weird one if you get stuck there um you know be careful give it a little bit of time um because it might be trying to it might have loaded a firmware or might have be you might be detecting that the first time so be be careful on no device detected just like rebooting the router or or being impatient with that one if you happen to see that um connected uh means the connection is working and healthy and then connected on and that that' be your Wi-Fi Wan letting you know that you're connected on a particular Wi-Fi network or in this case you'll see connected to uh T-mobile 5G so kind of crazy um but uh but there are meaning to all of these and they do tell you especially on the cellular side if it says initializing connecting and then obtaining IP address and it's spinning at OB obtaining IP address that means it's detected a carrier it's detected a a tower or it's it's it's established a connection to a tower and it can't get an IP address it could be a couple different things one it could be uh a bad account um so basically you're connected to T-Mobile but your account's not active and there therefore it's not going to give you a DHCP address or it could be that you're connected to the wrong carrier like you've selected T-Mobile and it's actually a Verizon or it could be that you have a private APN or a separate a different APN so the APN is wrong like for example if you have a static APN for T-Mobile you might have to do B2B do static instead of the default fast. tmobile.com and so you could have either an account issue a carrier issue or a APN issue is my my typical when when it says obtaining IP address it's stuck there when we talk about speed fusion um I I get this a lot and and there's a couple different things one speed Fusion operates on Port 4500 and 32015 and so it it needs to be able to connect uh inbound to its host whether that's your your peplink router in your office or to speed Fusion connect and so we want to make sure that um those those ports are allow allowed out whatever you're connecting using if it's cellular it's almost always allowed out but just if it's a private APN with a firewall or some varant thereof um authenticating means it's connected and it is they can see each other and they're authenticating creating a tunnel means it's authentication was detected and the um it the uh tunnel is now being configured um this could be that that Port 32015 so if you get the authenticating and it reboots means it it taught it discovered each other on 4500 it's creating the tunnel which is that UDP which is going to be on 32015 um and so it could be that that you're stuck in a loop because 4500 works and 32015 doesn't um updating routes means that it's taking the known IP information and this is where a lot of them fail and it's really fast if you have three routers and they all have 192168 50.1 and they're all connecting to an sdx router in your office and you don't have Nat enabled because it's on the un tag land when they connect the first one's going to connect and it's going to work the other two they're going to go to updating route and they go back to starting and there's going to be no warning there it's just going to go updating routes starting and it's really fast it'll go authenticating connecting creating tunnel updating routes starting and that's because the untagged land is conflicted so if you have an overlapping conflicting untagged land you're going to get a loop at updating routes you can have confecting vlans sub uh vlans on the network and it'll say inactive it'll Mark those that as inactive if they conflict but if you have the untag land it's gonna it's going to loop at updating routes so just be be aware of that and then established means that it negotiated it's got its route tables properly advertised or Nat tables properly advertised and and you have a connection on the Wi-Fi um access points uh I'm I'm so such a fan of in control nowaday days with uh Wi-Fi or AP management but um we do have the ssids shown here and so you'll see Wi-Fi um AP and the name and then on so you can toggle on and off the radio with the onof you can also do that in in control by toggling on and off if you see nothing there blank under Wi-Fi AP that means that you're using usually usually it means that you're using in control configuration and whatever ssids aren't being applied either because of the tag like you have the an appropriate tag assignment or some variant thereof but but if it's blank if it boots up and it's blank that usually means that you have some sort of tag Association where the ssids um in in control aren't being pushed be um or assigned to that router typically um otherwise if it's a factory default or factory settings you should see exactly what you see there that peplink underscore and the last four of the um serial number uh and then you'll see there you can also tell if it's br casting what channels so 2.4 and 5 gahz you can see that shows up right there then you have your AP controller information this is really nice if you're managing multiple APS within the router itself so it let you know that the one online one that's probably the the built-in AP and then you have six APS and then three clients so what this is saying is only one of your six APS is actually online right now and those three clients are using that one AP um the dashboard has changed a lot so I'm I'm going to launch into um my dashboard on my my lab device here so I'm going to go into my mbx hd4 that I have so an 8.4 firmware um or actually kind of 8.3 and then 8.4 we've made a lot of UI changes um kind of unifying the balance and the Mac series routers and so it's nice to be able to say hey this UI will apply to both Mac and um uh balance-based routers so the first thing you're going to have is your your Wan connection status and then those are going to be in priorities it's important to know that that priority is the the interface status so if if I have Google F and Priority One my Verizon Verizon and T-Mobile will go into standby if I have all four of those and and Priority One For Speed Fusion only Google file will be active because I have Google F in Priority One so this is the think of this as like interface status or interface priority then you can have outbound policies and speed Fusion tunnels they can use them but they have to be on here in order for that to work um so you have your priorities where you can you can um see the status there then you have your W your cellulars your Wi-Fi ws and then you can activate those this is a troubleshooting not a not a training on the dashboard so I'm going to go into troubleshooting um but you can see the status and health of those right there additionally if you click on the IP address over here you're going to get all your cellular information like your IMEI your SSI your um icci and your your signal strength um and then you have your your untagged land interface here so even if you have Sub sub uh vlans they're not going to show up this is your routers uh management interface that can't conflict if you're doing speed fusion and here you'll see your Wi-Fi APS so you can see I've got uh Rebel free Wi-Fi on 2.4 RR on 2.4 and five and then Renegade again on 2.4 and it's just labeled Renegade 24 and you can see there's my speed Fusion VPN status and my sfc protect status and then more importantly down below we have our I've got my 8.4 firmware my uptime my CPU my power consumption my temperature and then I've got all my power inputs so I've got my uh DCA B terminal block and then what current throughput is being used so the dashboard is is has gotten really good over the over the years and the the different firmwares so on cellular if you click on cellular you're going to get the IM um the the imsi the SIM card status you can see in use um and then you'll have your your all your cellular details right there including the model the modem you have um and the firmware of that modem right there in the details active sessions is a really good way to see what's happening on your network often I'm troubleshooting connectivity and the first thing I do is I'll go to active sessions and see if it's even getting where it needs to go um think of this as a a um a a simplified wire shark I kind of like showing you what's what's actively Crossing through the network but but not all the details so if you go to status active sessions and then you and then overview is going to give you your clients the total number of sessions and then the number of sessions on each Wan and I can hit refresh and it'll query and pull in the latest information I can then go to search refresh and it'll show me what's happening on this router right this second um and given the fact that it's a I just rebooted and tested or just testing this router there's really nothing going on right now but if I pull up my uh br2 Pro 5G that I'm using right now you should see this Zoom call happening um and but what's neat here is you can filter by Source or destination IP address ports protocols and um interfaces so if I'm if I if I want to see hey I've got some um clients that are you know using bit Tor what what what are they using or if they've got void I can actually see what they're doing based on the the the protocol and service you can select a service and see which interfaces or which connections that's using um I like to use it as a way of telling what what's using speed Fusion versus an ethernet connection or a Cellular Connection a lot of times like is my outbound if is my outbound policy working properly am I sending this out speed Fusion or am I sending this out a Cellular Connection so a lot of times I use active sessions to tell me if my outbound policies are working the way they're supposed to if that makes sense exactly where I was going to go this is one of my first sanity checks of like okay I've got everything set I've got my policies are things going where I expect them to and sometimes they're not right and that's you can see it really quickly here when you've said everything to go through speed Fusion or so you thought and you see things on a cellular interface or on an Ethernet interface warning look my br2 here I should be able to see um this Zoom call going on right now the um so go to status active sessions search refresh and there it is right there zoom using speed Fusion Gainesville and you can see all my sessions going on right now um from my laptop out to the internet using speed fusion and you can see there's an IP set going out cellular one right there so um so awesome so there there's a better visibility of that and once again knowing that I'm sending all that traffic out speed Fusion I this actually does bring up something I'm gonna segue real fast this IPC going out cellular one this is an ipcn issue so I have a policy saying send all traffic to speed Fusion but this IPC is going out cellular want why it should be going out speed Fusion because I've told it to send all traffic out speed Fusion if you go to Advanced service pass through there's a checkbox IPC Nat T if you want your IPC tunnels to go over speed Fusion especially if you're bonding starlink um and you want to take advantage of IPC and your IPC tunnels aren't establishing turn this off um that's going to allow IPC tunnels to follow outbound policies and go over speed Fusion if I hit save and apply whatever that tunnel is will then drop and move over so I'm not going to do it um but just letting you guys know it's there yes you can search by protocol IP address I just talked about that support. CGI so if you're in your router's UI and you see up here the index if I just double click and highlight index and change that to support so I'm going to go to support. CGI in my URL it's going to take you to a backend uh kind of support page for peplink there's a lot of things you can do here one landway ethernet details this is going to show you what's connected but also it's going to show you your receive and transmit U packets and errors more importantly so you can see drop packets and um and errors on those uh circuits as well as the status and health of each of your ws and your land what your negotiated so if I'm negotiating 100 megabits per second or I'm negotiating a gigabit or I'm getting some frame drops and things like that you can see that right here you can also turn on remote assistance you can download a diagnostic report but then you can also run a network capture so I click show choose my connection I'd like to capture on hit start and then I can actually download to 20 megabytes of data on a wire on a network capture and then load that into wire shark and see exactly what's going on in my network I I can also remote capture send this to an IP address important and hit start and it'll do that until the router boot reboots or until you click stop so you can actually do a a bigger capture and capture more data by sending that to a remote server but the the UI is limited to 20 megabytes or your free available storage so if it's less than 20 megabytes that means there's less than 20 megabytes of memory available on your uh on your router yeah 20 megabytes goes quickin yeah 20 megabytes goes very quick um you also have uh checking for me uh modu cellular module firmware so you can Che click check update and then push that highly recommended that if you're updating your cellular firmware that you're connected to a an Ethernet Wan take that router plug in the ethernet Wan connect it to your network Drag The Cellular Connections to a lower priority so they're on but uh but not being used then update your cellular firmware don't try to push cellular firmware over cellular um it in theory sometimes will work but but more often causes more problems than it than it helps um you can also do health check failure simulation so we're talking about troubleshooting we can simulate a failure of an internet connection for 60 seconds so I can click fail cellular one especially I'm doing this remotely it'll turn that off it'll it'll simulate a failure and then 60 seconds later turn that back on so you can test it without risking losing permanent access to the router um and then probably the other neat thing down here is net flow you can turn on your net flow here and enable your ipv4 IP I mean IP uh V5 v9 or IP fix um net flow right there there's other other things but those are the troubleshooting um yeah so it's support. CGI you can capture up to that 20 uh 20 megabytes and then load that into wire shark Network capture uses system resources RAM and flash storage um capture will automatically stop um if resources run too low um keep local cap capture small like run your test um just what you need don't don't run it unless you're doing a remote capture um capture on multiple capture on multiple devices when needed and then use remote capture if its large content um the event log is another great tool and Pink's done a really good job of add of of segregating out the the logs so you have your device log your ipvpn log your firewall log and your speed Fusion VPN log and they they filtered those out for you as tabs now so under status event log you can see um the different events that are happening on theet on your device uh and then in in real time but also historically but then all of those if you have multiple devices are rolled up into in control and you can pull up the group or uh level event log and see all your devices and their Wan status and things like that um so if you you want to do firewall logging you have to turn on event log if you go oh my firewall log is blank it always is you actually have to turn on event logging um and it's a it's actually a common practice let me go back to the dashboard here if I go to Advanced access rules um the default the default Deni policy actually doesn't allow event logging so if you wanted to have a default deny like my inbound here I I could go add and I could I go deny logging and I can say any any any deny and then enable event logging save and now I've got two of the same policies here but that's actually G be my deny logging um so if you want that default policy like this default allow I could click uh allow logging any any allow enable and then drag that down to the bottom and then now I'm enabling so I've got my my denies and then I've got my allows and I'm logging that allow and I'm logging the deny here um once you enable logging all that traffic will start to go into the event log however based on the size of your router those logs will get purged if they're too long so you want to pull those up in in control and they'll they'll you'll have better history but um based on the memory and resources available on the router uh specific model you might you know depending that the logging uses up a lot of resources and it's going to increase the amount of data transmitted to in control so just be aware of that yep you can also use third party like CIS log servers and things like that to receive those but yeah I mean to your point Peter those logs can get big fast if you're logging every little event but sometimes you need to yep and and we have the tools to do it if you need it so basic troubleshooting things to avoid if you're stuck in resetting mode don't attempt to unsafe or unhealthy unhealthy shutdowns and don't ever update a device while it's Mal functioning that right there is the number one reason I want wanted to have this session I get trouble tickets all the time they're having problems with the router it's in an unhealthy condition and they they update the firmware as a way to fix it because they don't want to reset the router and they don't want to don't do that if the router is not working don't update the firmware first you want to factory reset make sure it's in a healthy State even if it's a healthy State without the feature you need make sure it's in a healthy state then update the firmware if if it's a if you have the firmware and if the router's in a healthy state by all means go ahead and update the firmware keep your configuration great but if it's in an unhealthy State and you're trying to troubleshoot you're trying to fix a problem do it with a factory reset router don't do it with a production router or a production config because that unhealthy configuration could go to your new router I had a customer just on Friday night um I was actually down at hallowen horror nights and got a an Emergency like text message hey I'm having problems with this router I'm going to update it to 8.4 I said whoa whoa whoa factory reset it first see if it fixes the problem got a text message about 10 minutes later fixed the problem they had a configuration error hold the hold the reset button for 25 seconds factory reset it the Cellular Connections worked perfectly then they then they went ahead and safely updated to 8.4 but but don't use firmware as a way of fixing a problem unless it's a known problem that the firmware is fixing that you're trying to achieve like whatever's in the the the actual um repair sheet like uh and the release notes sorry sorry my brain farted there and the release notes um so now we're gonna talk about some testing hopefully I have enough time yeah okay we're good on time um so Wan analysis pep VPN test connection test speed Fusion VPN testing um GPS forwarding diagnostic reports Geo fencing Network optimization netf flow I'm not going to test all those in this um like I said this is a snippet what I'm gonna do is overview that you can do it and then I'm going to show you the ones that I find very valuable so we'll go through the slides and I'm gonna actually going to show you w analysis which I love and I'm going to show you speed Fusion test um which I also love so otherwise we're going to stay in the slides for those way analysis basically requires two routers um it uses net cup to uh to establish a tunnel or to establish the the session and um and it'll test each Wan circuit independently give you your total throughput you can then run the math on this minus your 18 18% overhead and then have um and then have and then that should give you your your approximate speed fusion throughput and so that's that's also a nice thing about it um and so the idea here is though you can test each circuit and get the circuit information um uh without just regular internet traffic no speed Fusion no speed test.net or whatever it is that you might be using for performance and so what you're doing is from my point my router to my my data center or my other router this is the throughput that I'm getting raw um very powerful tool um speed Fusion test is once you've done the WAN analysis let you know how those WS are talking back to your your host um so your latency your packet loss um Etc and what's interesting is I had a customer call me a couple weeks ago they were doing a live broadcast and they were getting massive packet loss like 1300 packets per second or 1400 packets per second when they only were getting like six megabits of throughput anything more than that just massive packet loss the customer is freaking out like can we restart speed Fusion can we reboot the router can we update the firmware and I like well hold on let's take a look at it I run a speed test sure enough massive Packa well then I ran a Wan analys analyzer to my data center I was just because I just I have access to that so I I spun up the host I ran zero packet loss hundreds of Megs of throughput they were get like 180 190 Megs of throughput and I was like that's weird so then I logged into their router ran a ran a performance packet loss massive packet loss at around six to seven megabits per second and I was like huh that's weird I noticed that they were consuming around 40 43 42 megabits of usage I clicked on the W to check the MTU to see what maybe maybe it was wrong MTU or not negotiating properly and I saw that they had set the speed to 50 megabits so they had a 50 megabit fiber line they're using 43 megabits they hit six megabits and then they were done that was it um and and so they massive packet loss and so it's so easy to go oh the the cellular is dropping on me the the connection but there's also another end to that there there there's another piece to that you that we also need to pay attention to um and so it's it's important when you're expecting a problem stop slow down pull yourself away from that and and look at the whole connection not just the one piece that you think is acting up because sometimes it's not that piece it's something else Y when you I see similar things on like the cellular latency you know you everything was working great now now it doesn't work and you go and look in there and you'll see cellular latencies of you know 1,000 2,000 3,000 milliseconds right and that's your sign that the cellular n network is congested usually and you know it might have worked a couple hours ago but that doesn't mean there's not congestion now and that's your warning sign it's not a a problem on the speed Fusion necessarily but exactly and so when you run your speed test you're G to get these nice results it's going to tell you the retransmits uh um your uh your throughput and then kind of give you this the the four session or four threads and then your total um it's a great way to see packet loss latency um retransmits total throughput and you can see them all and I'm going to show you a little trick to that as well actually I'm do that right now um so let's go into my 5G router this one right here so if I go to status I go to speed Fusion and I want to test these these four cellular and see how they're working mostly to see if they're being throttled or and or underperforming I can click the little carrot and see this right here says remote connections show remote connections this then shows me what it's the Ws that it's connecting to on the remote side if I had two a dual cellular a dual ethernet router this would say Wan one and Wan two um so so I then I create a long test so I can say give me um 100 seconds of down download and I can click Start and then what I start doing is I look at this okay 2 2.3 okay 44947 okay let's just pretend this one's like 600 kilobits oh there you go 300 kilobits I go that's weird um and so then I can turn off this vanan and see if the other ones improve so I'll pick the slowest uh connections and see if it improves the capacity look at that I turned off Verizon and then my my connection so I had TCP ramp up which was enabling when smoothing for the first 10 seconds that high throughput was because I was using Wan smoothing Verizon is only getting 300 kilobits now look at my connection when I turned off Verizon it's awesome but Verizon was at 300 kilobits so my Verizon obviously I've used up all my data and I'm being throttled that I mean I didn't mean for that to happen in this demo but that was a really cool scenario when smoothing because it sends parody BS they just ignored the two Verizon that were running slow because the other two connections were running fast and now I'm getting 105 megabits of throughput and so I will and if I don't know I'll just randomly click one I'll just start playing with them and I'll turn them on and off that's why I said 100 seconds sometimes I use my intuition like oh that one looks like it's slower or that one went slower first um but but I'll I'll turn them on and off and then you can see now I'm running at 125 megabits per second once I turned off Verizon obviously my Verizon cards are being throttled probably because I ran too much data through it but um but it's a really really powerful way to see what's going on and to troubleshoot speed Fusion performance um other factors are high latency and high packet loss so I I was monitoring I was able to fix this with just throughput but you also want to pay attention to the latency in the packet loss if you have high packet loss where the router can't overcome that packet loss with the multiple internet connections or FC or when smoothing turn the high packet loss ones off and see if that that boosters performance um and so it's a it's an amazing tool that allows you to and you can see here one mag two Megs one Meg two Megs one Megs two Megs 11 17 100 100 100 100 70 80 I mean way better um and so I was able to to to solve that by by getting rid of that that horribly um throttled connection the other thing I can show you another way to detect that same scenario would be with a Wan and analyzer so if I go to my system and I go to WAN analysis I can say as a client and then I need a router that I can pull up that that is on as a public IP on the internet so I've got my little speed Fusion overview router here it's a little balance 380 so I'm going to pull that up go to site B and I can go to to settings device tools select it and go to WAN performance server and turn it on you can see here my control Port 6000 if you need to change that for whatever reason you can change that there and then there's my public IP so I copy the public IP go back over to my uh client and go Cellular One cellular 2 cellular 3 cellular four and I would expect to see between the four of them around a 100 megabits of throughput because that's what we were getting bonded 120 so maybe 150 Megs so we'll do download and I can do TCP or UDP um tunneling does use UDP so TP will be a little bit different so I could I could actually set UDP and say you know use you know 30 Megs each but I'll just do a TCP test and hit start and what I'd like to see is cellular uh the blue and the green carrying the most load and you can see that right there you see the the red and the orange are they've getting a little bit of throughput but the blue and the green are really carrying the load there and you can see that um you the the red is almost non-existent uh and in the throughput there um and so so you can see like like w analysis right there shows me that red and orange are just red is non-existent I could probably have turned off the red one and left the orange one and had a little bit of bandwidth there but um when I was doing my testing that's just what I had done this lets me see that for real I can see that that Google f is carrying a really decent amount of load AT&T is or T-Mobile is killing it down there in the T-Mobile 5G my red is non-existent and then I've got that back that other Verizon sim that is carrying some load but I had to shut that off so this lets me see that real time does that make sense oh you guys can't answer me so I'm going to pretend you said yes um so great tool though is my point I mean it's a great tool for for troubleshooting your circuits yeah I I like the way you you position that I mean it's it's a it's a kind of a beginning step right you see what the raw throughput is on all of those links and then you can use that to kind of predict what you might expect or need to do on on your speed Fusion side and yeah yeah hot failure test is is pretty easy um let's see if they have a slide for it yeah so like we mentioned earlier so you can actually do the um the the the simulation which will turn it off and turn it back on so you can have like uh Cellular One cellular two or your fiber and then failing over to 5G hit enable it'll shut that off for 60 seconds and you should have it if it doesn't if it fails it'll turn that back on in 60 seconds so you don't have to worry about messing up sometimes you know me I like to be in person I'm just going to rip the cable and see what happens um but um failover testing is a great way to use that under support. CGI um bandwidth bonding we just tested there so that's good GPS forwarding um I'm I'm only going to show it to you I'm not going to demonstrate that um the setup of it is too much for a lab environment but um if you go a lot of especially our First Responders um they want they need to have um GPS especially for like their cameras and their vehicles into their cat systems and things like that um we have G we have now have GPS forwarding and GPS receiver so you can go to GPS forwarding and turn it on and you can add um either nmea or tyap and you can add multiple server destinations here so if someone tells you Pepin can't do multiple server destinations they're wrong there it is right there um the other thing we can do is actually act as a GPS receiver um and so we can receive GPS signals from a device and actually act as a a receiver now if you think about this say I have a and and um I've never done this so I'm actually talking to this in real time with Mr peplink over here but um my understanding is what I can actually have like an HD1 Dome transmit to an sdx and now the sdx is receiving a GPS signal and has an active GPS would that be accurate yeah I mean sometimes it a m it's very well not sometimes it's very important especially in public safety to know who's on first you know who whose location what is the you know where is this thing right and especially when you get multiple devices in a vehicle you start getting slight differences of like okay I've got two GPS antennas and this one said I was here and this one said I was here but you know when you're going to put it all together you want it all to be on the same data the same Tim stamp the same location and so this is how you could help do that whether that's with two peplink products for other part you know third party products yep yeah so so what's really neat is we now have a the ability to actually do act as a GPS receiver now this is um not troubleshooting this is just a really cool feature but it's cool in 8.4 so I I I'm hovering over this you can see the link right there there there's a software um that's that's linked right there on this uh hopefully you can see I don't know if you can see it in the video but we'll try to put a link in the description but basically you can download this Nema settings and you can run this on a PC then you can actually act as your own and actually see the GPS settings right there it's a really cool tool it's free you can download it um and it basically is a Nemo router um and it lets you just receive GPS streams from your devices to make sure that they're working properly yeah and from a troubleshooting standpoint I think the scenario is why isn't my peplink able to talk to this software or you know something along those lines and yeah seeing that stream is often the answer to why it's not working it's just formatted slightly different than you were expecting it to or something like that but exactly um diagnostic reports as much as I would you're gonna ask questions about this or complain about it we um are not allowed to read them that is for engineering only um and so there's two ways to if engineering if you're creating a ticket engineering ask for a diagnostic report there's two ways to get an diagnos report one is um from a control you can click next to your device name hit show all and you can actually download diagnostic report right there and the other is from the UI you can go to status and download a diagnostic report right here um and while I'm here if peplink asks you to turn on remote assistance right there you can turn on remote assistance so you have your diagnostic report and you have your remote assistant right there on the status device page of your UI on in control you would go to you can do diagnos report right there or you go to settings device tools and turn on remote assistance right there on inside in inside in control um so peplink uh text support asks you to um send a diagnostic report and turn on remote assistance you can do that right from in control um download that and transmit or if you don't have access to in control because it's not online then you can do that from the UI as well um so those things the other thing that I would like to show you for this and since we're here is if you click show all you also get configuration backups every time someone hits um apply changes you're going to get a configuration backup saved this is incredibly useful because I'll get a call hey our Network just went offline what what changed last nothing we did nothing we changed nothing I pull up and I go to configuration backups I click download and I go really why do you have two changes today obviously that's not today it's on the 5th but um so I can download a copy of those and actually load them up in my lab or I could say you know what yesterday you were working let me just apply yesterday's configuration file and I can click apply right here and it actually loads that configuration file to that router um and and and then we'll we'll activate that configuration so if they said they made no changes you can then apply yesterday's config where you knew you had or the last known good config in a sense um incredibly powerful troubleshooting which I'm sure will be in the slides but since we were right there I just wanted to show you right there yeah that's one of those like best hidden features it's oh my gosh almost anybody can use it but not many people know it's there yeah it's really powerful um Geo fencing um I I use Geo fencing for my fleet to turn off Wi-Fi when I'm I'm in my property so anytime we pull up into our our building um or the our parking lot I shut off the Wi-Fi on the vehicle um that way we're not accidently connecting and then wasting data um being broadcast but you can use geofencing to apply tags to turn on and off Wi-Fi um or to push firmware updates which we've talked about for firmware too like you know if if I've got a fleet of Public Safety Vehicles what's what's a good time of day to update a squad car well I don't know while it's on call whatever whatever time it's not out in the streets right if it's back at the de probably a good time right so I can trigger firmware updates to only happen when they're parked in the parking ramp and not out doing important things so under yeah under settings geofence you can create a geofence that's your your Depot and then say allow firmware updates then under firmware management you have um scheduled immediate schedule and then geofence so if you create a Geo fence called Depot you can then say apply the 8.4 firmware when they enter the depot they drive up to the depot Boom the firmware downloads and loads up and re the router will then reboot really cool um Network optimization has changed and is incredibly complicated when you're talking about different mediums so when bonding similar Technologies you're going to have the most calculable um performance if I have two one gig fiber lines that are one gig by one gig from two different isps Cox and unity or whatever and I'm bonding those together I'm going to get 1.82 megabits per gigabits of through I it's going to be right at the the the the calculated the the stated throughput minus the speed Fusion overhead it's going to be there because the latency is going to be low it's an SLA circuit I'm going to be getting two gigs of through PL it's gonna happen cable modems not necessarily they're best effort Services I mean sometimes I getting gig sometimes I might get 600 Megs sometimes I might get 400 Megs sometimes I might get 800 Megs and so when you're you're talking about variable performing circuits you can't run a mathematical calculation to say I should get this much throughput on a variable circuit and so we try to do um handle that with Dynamic weighted bonding but as you just witnessed when I did the demo Verizon was performing so poorly that that the router couldn't comp compensate for that throughput and really what should we should have is like a a minimum throughput checkbox hey if I'm getting if if I'm running you know more than two megabits of data and I have a circuit that's getting less than half a you know 500 kilobits or whatever shut that circuit down but um but the idea here is is that highly underperforming circuits will affect the performance of your bonding and it's up to us as Network Engineers OR tech support or whatever it is that your job or role might be to understand that well let's just call that job security right um as much as these systems are perfect are is great they're not perfect no system is and so when we're looking at this we need to pay attention to latency packet lost and how similar the circuits are the more different the circuit is the more we need to to to to to pay attention to that that performance so using WS with similar bandwidth within 50% of each other is going to give you the best bonding capabilities best best best calculable response um if I have a 500 Meg circuit and a gig circuit that's going to be 1500 Megs minus my 18% overhead it's going to work if I have a one gig circuit and a 100 Meg circuit I'm going to get less than a one gig because 1.1 gigs minus 18% is actually less than one gig so at that point I'm looking at the fact that I might be just adding some stability to a circuit for that you know may maybe using hot failover instead of bonding type scenario um so so the the purpose of this slide is to say pay attention to the throughput as we just witnessed during that M that that accidental demo that I just did where my Verizon must I mean when I ran the test previously they weren't throttled so they must have hit their 22 gigabytes or whatever it is and then been throttled um using uh sources from different isps will maximize your total capacity so if I have AT&T and Verizon and T-Mobile and US Cellular and starlink and Cox and unity as long as they're all different I'm gonna have the best uh results because congestion will be spread across all the circuits that are sharing the same network so if I have three Verizon or two Verizon and one of them uh and they and Verizon is being congested both Verizon are going to feel feel that and so it's the diversity is is best but there are places and I I have it right now where I'll have four AT&T's in a in a network because AT&T is the only provider in that area and what you're then what you're doing is you're saying give me the most pieces of the pie if if if I've got 10 people on a tow and it's 100 Meg Tower each person gets 10 Megs if I'm two of those pieces I get 20 Megs so the more pieces of that piie the better we're going to get but we're still sharing a common piie um and so uh diversity is great but when when you don't have it quantity still will beat other single people like so if I've got four SIM cards running AT&T versus one person getting AT&T my four is going to perform better because I'm getting more time slices if that makes sense might have been too complicated I apologize and we are getting really job security job security um I'm gonna skip calculating over ahead and latency um because I want we're almost at the end and I want to get some factors uh land link testing we already did that um I we talked about latency land quality um signal strength back call availability we talked about the number of devices and then the the right plan I never really talked about that but the right plan matters um if if you go out and buy a gray sem card which is these these people that will sell you like cards that are supposedly unlimited there's no such thing as unlimited you can argue with me all day long there's no such thing star Link's not unlimited 5G is not unlimited AT&T variz T-Mobile not unlimited so we have to combat that the best we can and we do have ways of doing that multiple SIM cards diversity spreading the load reducing that that the the demand per card but but there's no such thing as unlimited if anybody tells you that they're lying to you I'm I'm I'm going to say that Professor P right on the internet um and so um with the exception of an SLA gigabit fiber line there there's no such thing as unlimited and so pay attention to where what you're at because if you've hit a threshold you might get a fair use policy that says hey you're unlimited but uh you're in the top 1% we had to lower your priority because you just sucked up two and a half terabytes of data um so pay attention to that it's going to be really important yeah and there's there's tools there right there's the B there's the custom Sim pools there's different ways that you can track that react to that automate those things but it to your point Peter you have to be aware of those as as the expert and the person managing these connections those will all influence your outcomes and you got to be on top of it and we've got tools to help but and we have the tools to help we can it and Dem I just demonstrated it we can see it um firmware um there you know as we get new firmware um read the the I'm hoping that most of the people on this are Tech read the read the release notes there there are guides in there too it's like hey if you're running eight uh seven 6.3 firmware don't try to load 8.4 it it's G to be an undesirable resp uh effect um there are the release notes have like hey like this this is this is the last generation for this particular model um up to if you have firmware 7.1 upgrade to 7.2 then upgrade to um 8.13 then then 8.4 so they have guides in the firmware notes to tell you what you should be doing um and if you're going from a really old firmware to a really new firmware check the release notes of the different firmware models you can get those inside in control very very easily go to in control go to settings go to Firmware management and Let's Pretend This is a 6.3.4 router look at this all my routers are right there so I can go let me pull 7.1.2 download the release notes and check it out then then I can go okay what's my next firmware here 8.0 um yeah 8.0 8.1 so just just read each major release and make sure there's not a note about your router because a lot of times people go oh I just went from 7.12 to 8.4 and now it's crashing and rebooting and stuck on rebooting we reboot act 7.12 and then we safely update it properly and then it goes well so read the re read the release notes and you just click on the router or the firmware then click release notes and you're going to get the release notes for that firmware super easy and then in the release notes on the very front right there devic is supported right there Then important notes look at this for transits please use special firmware 8.1 special instead of 812 ga I mean they're right there telling you what to do for balance 20 Hardware um I'm sorry this um for the following models the units must be upgraded to 712 before 8.0 if you have a br1 br1 Mini br1 Pro br1 slim br2 Soho you have to go to 712 before 8.0 so they're telling you how to prevent mistakes in the first nine seconds of the of the release note you don't have to release you don't have to read every single thing saying they improved but just read the important notices if you're going from a major like a really old router to a firmware to a new firmware just make sure that your router is not noted here in the important notes um it'll it'll help prevent a bunch of tech support problems um it is been an hour um there like I said there's a lot here if you like this uh please join us in November at the tech Summit um I I I love talking about um the this it just I love it um and we we didn't have enough time to cover everything in one hour um I do want to give a couple minutes for some case or for some questions is that okay Travis can we go a little bit over okay so we're gonna do a couple um couple questions um and if we don't get to your question please uh Peter at West networks.com Travis pink.com uh we we'll get you in the in in the right person I we have people from all over the world that email us we will direct you to a local partner a local resource we'll get you in the right person if you uh if you have questions that don't get answered [Music] um uh we we do have a uh uh a pink representative here uh uh Adrian said it' be helpful to have the error States it would be uh we throw that out there to peplink it would be helpful if error code error states were better better visualized um like I had an example with like an SFP that was unsupported the logs showed unsupported SFP but the but the you know but the router just said no cable detected it would have been really neat if I plugged in unsupported SFP if it said unsupported SFP um and since peplink watches this video I would I'll actually I I like that feedback yeah and I think sometimes we've done things like an in control like if there's um like a high temperature we'll put a a warning in the in control guey kind of like Auto detect that right and put some sort of visual warning there or you know default passwords another example of that but yeah there's there's some dots to connect sometimes there that aren't easy to understand or realize that you need to and I I would agree with that too um Paul asked a good question about command line our CLI is very very very basic um most of our tools are designed to be gooey um and it sort of hits the the target market of who we support but also goes into into the whole idea of sdwan and what we're doing um so unfortunately our CI is very limited to basic status only um so you're going to want to you know if we don't have the right report or right tool please email us let us know we we'll get that added as a feuture request yeah and I think often the API is the path that folks that are command line friendly should look at I mean I know they're not exactly the same but often times it's what are you trying to accomplish and you are able to accomplish those things often with the API in a similar manner at least but yeah if there if was there's something we're missing there definitely feedback is always welcome too um somebody asked a question about some some routers going offline every seven minutes for a few hours um I would I'd be really interested to see the logs um that's where we need to look at your cellular logs is the cellular dropping is the router rebooting is it a power issue um so that's where looking at your Wan logs and your system logs would would allow us to see why they're going offline um because if it goes offline there's going to be some log that's going to tell you it's it's gone offline so my first thing when I see something like that would be pull up the logs look at my Wan logs or am I is it saying Cellular One disconnected is it cellular saying W failed ping test um what what is that why or is it saying the router rebooted and seven minutes is about the time for a reboot which means that if it's a fleet maybe there's a 12volt power issue maybe someone's turning something on that's drawing too much power and the router is not getting its its um the proper amperage or voltage of power um so I would I would start there but if you do need further help but once again please please feel free to email um there are a lot of questions so I'm trying to pick some good ones that we can grab here um somebody asked if your if your laptop and a vehicle can now receive Google Map turn BYT stretch directions never tested that but in theory if you transmit uh the GPS to your laptop as long as your laptop has a receiver for GPS and sees it that way I mean it' be a fun test um but I I've never I don't I don't know if Google Maps actually has laptop turn BYT capabilities anyways I mean honestly that's kind of a backwards version of what a lot of the public safety agencies implement the the GPS export yep but they have special software right they have the CAD software and it goes in but the answer is I mean if the software supports it yes I mean that's the point of GPS transmit yep same concept yeah to your point does the software support it we'll add the Nema um Link in the in the description um so that that that slide that has the Nema Nema settings link We'll add that in the description of the video um there's no proper configuration of speed Fusion bonding there's recommendations but but as you see there's also tuning um so someone asked do you have a proper a a link for proper configuration um the reason why we have so many options and capabilities is based on the number of links I do have a starlink video um but I will tell you I had some starlink performance issues one time and I enabled Wan smoothing and it was spectacular so if you have two starlinks try way smoothing and see what it does um it won't that's not for everybody that's not a generic Bing statement but if you're having performance issues try it and see what happens um and and for me it was spectacular in that one scenario I think the general rule of thumb with speed Fusion is configure as little as po as you need to like start simple starts small don't set a bunch of parameters and one change at a time yeah one change at a time don't assume that you need to set this or that just start basic and then yeah save apply and change it on both sides you almost always too that's another trap I see people fall into is they'll change one setting and sometimes it does make sense in Niche situations to not change it on the other side but almost always you want parody and you want that those settings to match and keep that in mind as your troubleshooting performance if you don't see 8.4 firmware and you only see 8.3 it's possible that your router doesn't support 8.4 so uh as I mentioned in the firmware options here um in the release notes like if I go to 8.4 um and I pull the release notes it'll show um devices supported right here um and then important notices and see this important notices further um major for will not be supported they will um they will receive 8.3 so if your router is one of these routers you can't get 8.4 you'll only get 8.3 maintenance releases so um so it it might might be that your router just it might be time to uh to reach out to your partner um or distributor and potentially look at getting uh Modern Hardware at that point that was a good question I like that yep there's an end of the train for every Hardware platform eventually and we try to push that out as long as we can but yeah there are all mod firware that don't make that cut so uh question says why can't you show the status of land ports um you you can um on some Hardware so if I if I pull up my um I pull up my there we go go to status if you go to status ethernet ports if your router has a switch Port that has the the capabilities there's your status right there I can see my Poe's on and I can see that that there's nothing plugged into them so status ethernet ports will show you not every router supports this that is a a managed switch functionality but if your router does support it it is right there that support CGI page would be the other place to go look if you don't yeah yeah and then support support. CGI and then you go L when ethernet details and then you can see your um connections and their their status sometimes you'll see that there's there's only one landan listed but there's you know four ports or something like that so that's oftentimes a shared controller so you don't see each Port individually in some cases some Hardware you do some hardw you don't Paul um asked if it be said be beneficial for a part two uh join me at the summit ah I got the right back um so join me at the summit let's get some let's get some techie people on this I I got um it'd be a lot of fun um but um and then and then if if uh if you can't make it let me know but we're gonna do this every year we did it last year we're gonna do it this year we're gonna do it next year um so and we're gonna always go with the latest so you know it's 8 8.3 last year 8.4 this year you know probably 9.0 next year or whatever the next uh major release is um so the new 8.4 how do I get the new starlink features um it's I have we have the starlink webinar in the 8.4 webinar but uh if you go to Advanced I'm sorry if you go to network Wan and then right there you can turn on your starlink so you click edit and you can say w one is a starlink and w two is a starlink and then that'll turn on the starlink features for you um I think we're we're at 110 I'm going to do one more question um there's a really cool question that's kind of troubleshooting but not um there's a question says how can I make the balance U beyond the peplink router follow the GPS uh follow the router GPS on the map um there's a really cool feature inside in control um so if I go on in control and go to my device so this um device details show all edit and there's an option it says follow another GPS location if I turn this on I can select a a supporting router that's also in this group like an HD1 Dome and this balance router or this AP or this whatever so say I have like um a a ship or that has you know maybe two HD1 domes a a Balan 580 and like 10 APS and I want all those to move around together I can have the two the HD1 domes select the HD1 Dome as my follow location for the router and the APS and then the router and the aps will all follow that HD1 Dome around um I we use this all the time it's a it's a great feature and at this point I'm gonna say we're out of time for more questions I love troubleshooting and support it's one of my favorite topics um I go I I get a little too crazy about it sometimes in our in our um sessions I would encourage you to join us at the peplink tech Summit if you can't make it next year if you still can't make that um reach out let me know maybe we can set one up in your area or do something with some local Partners in your area to get that set up and um and then you have additional questions um please email us um we we'll be happy to get you in contact with the right resource to answer those questions or you can always just schedule a call with me um if you go to Sales West networks.com ask the team and they'd be more than happy to set up a call and we can troubleshoot or work through some situations and get you in contact with a good support um uh partner so um but thank thank you so much for the time today thank you uh Travis once again for another uh for uh for hosting and and giving your valuable time to to allow us to share this information yeah absolutely Peter and I'm just typing some more responses here to others in the in the chat there's it's a great topic and it's always going to be there right and so yeah we can keep doing this one and um someone did ask if we do a part two I'll look at how far we made it and see where we were and maybe do a part two a follow-up on this where we can do troubleshooting part two so I will I will actively talk to Travis about um if if that's what we want to do if you'd like to see a part two if you'd like to see me continue down this path um send us an email let us know hey I'd like to see a part two and then give me some case studies give me some scenarios what would you like to see how can I help you better learn how to troubleshoot ping networks um and if if we get enough responses we'll definitely make that another video all right folks thanks again as always Peter thank you take care have a good one guys bye"}

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "all right folks thanks for joining I'm Travis Derek I'm a product manager here at peplink and today we're going to be giving you another pep talk a sales presentation about managed service providers and joining us again today we've got Michael Maitland sales director at Frontier hey Mike how's it going it's going great Travis thank you for having me again look forward to uh another pep talk we've taken a few months off for the summer uh vacation but look forward to getting back into these and MSP um and the managed service provider space is is really exciting one for this channel so looking forward to dig in absolutely yeah msps are just a huge part of our business and so more and more we're just trying to find ways that we can align with msps and find ways to work together and solve problems so that's what we're going to talk about today um I think Mike I think you said it great earlier there's really no one size for an MSP there's so many different focuses and so many different I guess makeups of msps it's a broad term yeah yeah and I mean like you say it's not one side no one size fits all and and really that's falls into pep link and and the solutions we bring to the table because we're really unique in the fact that we can help you know almost all of them with what their focus is and and they all kind of roll into to one you know one answer or not one answer but just one just really platform that that can help them across any any vertical or application yeah it's fun to see the different verticals applications I mean we see some msps that are just focused on um you know chain restaurants and some that are focused on just you know employee bus Wi-Fi and you know so there's really General use cases like you know just office failover and there's really specific use cases but um I think no matter what an MSP may be focused on there's a lot of things that matter to just about any MSP there's a lot of challenges and things that just really make or break in MSP and so I think in their world you know integration with other vendors is a huge deal msps are always trying to put Solutions together and use different vendors but then once they do that they need to make sure that those things work day to day ongoing beyond that I don't know yeah yeah definitely and and you know and then these things just kind of hit on top of Mind subjects that we talk a lot with msps the liability and the performance how important that is the ability to scale really helping them grow their their customers and their customer base and you know security clients always top of mind with with customers and partners um costs and how you manage that you know always so important in the scalability and then and then support right with peplink rolling out more 24 7 support and in the channel helping out with that right and really bringing better and and stronger support initiatives to the table to help msps grow and scale quickly when that may not be one of their their their best uh factors right so yeah so there's a lot here right there's a lot here and we're not going to talk about all of this right now but we're going to dive into these topics in more detail and try and speak more specifically to how we're able to help msps in these different areas exactly um but I think one thing that everybody sees out there and it's not just msps right it's msps it's their customers it's me it's epic everybody uses Zoom teams WebEx these different collaboration platforms we all need these things to work better we all need our VoIP calls to work better you know a lot of us are running you know point-of-sale system Square Stripes some of these other different online or in-person um payment platforms and these things just have to work and so you know for any MSP when you work with peplink you can confidently come into a customer and say hey we're able to make these things work better we're able to make these things much more reliable much more consistent and so that's the message that I think just about any MSP is going to be able to run with and have a customer really understand that right again we all we've all seen that those bad calls yeah and and you know to that you know if a user isn't experience any challenges the MSP is probably not going to hear from them or can handle those uh those issues on their own in the background and with some of these capabilities with speed Fusion those users don't experience any challenges with the teams with the phone calls for the POS and again that means they're not calling that means they're not um bringing up the concerns and letting that MSP kind of handle things in the background but yeah experiencing it like they need to um so that they're happy and just just focusing on their work and their day-to-day um that's what our tool sets do so yeah I think the biggest value proposition or one of the biggest value propositions with peplink is we're able to fix these problems and that's something that just no other router company can really say you you get another cellular router out there and they can't fix these problems they don't have the technology to do this and so this is just a huge way to stand out from the crowd and be able to come to your customer and say look I know your your team's calls get kind of messy sometimes we're going to fix that so it's a great foot in the door for just about anybody who's had those problems and lots of people have um another thing that we see out there a lot in the MSP world that's really gained traction lately and not everybody's using it yet but again just really really rapid growth is with starlink um and again especially in that MSP space starling's kind of a new technology and a little bit um unknown for a lot of people so it's really been an opportunity for msps to dig in and learn the technology quick and you know when you pair it with peplink it's it just works even better so Mike I know you've seen some examples of msps out there using starlink right now yeah and you know in a big picture is more about Innovation things and Technologies change and peplink's really able to quickly adapt to those and incorporate those into their Solutions and their capabilities but starlinks definitely won I mean it's repeat it's one thing that we see gets people and companies into more rural areas challenging connectivity spots and and peplink's ability to work with starlink and and provide even failover from Starlin because it's not a perfect solution yet it is really something that's important and there's some exciting things coming down and even in the new firmware you see some capabilities now with starlink but you know the the biggest thing to me is starlinks another technology and there'll be another one someday down the line and peplink just integrates these seamlessly as they come to the table to really allow you know managed service products to do what's best for them and their customers and and use all these things whether it's 5G startling five whatever it is um it really opens up the door and and makes it easy to to incorporate yeah you've got a common platform that you can use to interface with those different Technologies right it can be different Technologies in different locations but it's the same experience it's the same technology it's the same you know platform behind it um yeah I remember you mentioned like a construction company I think you guys worked with that was doing something with Starling yeah an MSP focused on construction yeah an MSP that that works with construction companies that uh you know basically in rural Northeast the U.S and they've started to incorporate starlink but the the customer wasn't experiencing it in at 100 success right there was issues there was challenges but it did open up the doors to utilize this and exactly that's where peplink comes in because starlink Incorporated right and use it when it's there but there's still challenges like like I mentioned before and so how do we add other connectivity options to the table to help kind of smooth all that out and and that's what they saw as kind of a key factor in why peplink's a a strong solution for them and uh and and when they want to move forward yeah I think that combination of Star Lincoln 5G is such a game changer I mean it really neither technology is perfect right but they they are both pretty awesome and they both enable really new capabilities and so yeah when you're able to leverage the two together and kind of combine the the benefits of them and use them to back up the the maybe drawbacks that happen from time to time again as an MSP you can deliver things that you just couldn't do last year frankly right you're just a brand new world out there of new possibilities with these Technologies and again you need something in the middle to smooth them out and make them behave the way customers want them to but that's where we come in exactly um another thing that we see in just a ton of activity out there in the MSP space is just 5G in general but um fixed wireless access the the carriers out there have released some pretty attractive plans on the 5G side so that um you know the the price points are getting a lot more realistic and customers are starting to really Embrace these connections either as a primary connection or as a backup for their wire line because it is actually fast enough to deliver wire line type speeds now so you can actually look at it as a failover or a primary connection realistically yeah and you know our conversations a few years ago was always about failover how do we how do we accommodate that fiber line going down or being struck by a backhoe or or whatever you know cable line is um it's truly moving away from that yes they're still utilized they're still incorporating in the solution on the network but but you can feel confident and you can take your your business critical application really run your Enterprise on these Wireless Solutions whether it's 5G or or whatever you want to add and you can truly do it without wire today A lot of times it's still a combination but really just depends where you're at and and and and that's pretty cool to see and live through yeah and so we'll talk about this in more detail in a minute here but you know we're our platform is able to use all of these great new carrier plans that have been released for fixed wireless access but we also have a built-in connectivity platform in our device so we've got our own speed Fusion connect 5G LTE Connection in there as well and so the routers ship with connectivity built in you don't have to use that built-in connectivity option but the point being you've got multiple different ways that you can get your customer connected and and you know find those different revenue streams by selling and enabling cellular data connectivity yeah exactly and using it as a combination there's a lot of times a great solution so yeah so one thing that we see a lot of out there is there's just different terms in the space um in terms of like how we talk about this hardware and how we're using the hardware or you know how we might be deploying it for a customer and so there's thing words like adapter or router or Gateway and I think the thing the message that I want to make clear is our devices are basically all of those so you can use this br1 Pro 5G this is a 5G router it's a 5G Gateway it could be a 5G adapter you can check a box and it's an adapter right you can plug it into an existing firewall or router if the customer's already got a Cisco deployment and they just want to add 5G and you're the MSP bringing 5G to them cool you can use the peplink br1 pro 5G as an adapter and it'll just pass everything through to their their firewall but other locations they might need an actual router or firewall there and so I think Gateway and router are kind of interchangeable um basically that's going to be the core piece of your network and manage all the connectivity for your network when it's used like that but again this one device it's simple and it can be used for all three different scenarios yeah and that adapter piece is the kind of the most interesting there because you we get left out of a lot of spaces sometimes because it doesn't say the term adapter but each peplink device can be utilized just like Travis said as an adapter and in in the future it has the capability to be extended right into something more if needed but that that integration is a huge piece to the peplink ecosystem and being so simple to add to any network yeah and I think another thing that we really see is in in the business World there there really is a need for a different class of an adapter right the you know the carriers all have their their free device that comes with these plans and if you talk to a carrier sales rep they're usually pretty willing to admit like those aren't great devices for a business and you know they've seen that just through trial and error if businesses trying them and they're just not they're more of a home device right and so they don't have that 24 7 always on always connected day in day out type of reliability and so you know businesses are going to need a little bit higher end device to maintain that business level expectation but again the br1 pro 5G is there and able to do that but um I think that's a common mistake that a lot of companies will make is just try and make the cheap thing work and then they get frustrated with the technology and say all the technology doesn't work well no maybe it was just a bad device and so that's really where msps can come in and show customers a better way and you know not have to put them through that trial and error stage of trying those cheaper devices but budgets you know budgets do change right there are people who just can't afford everything 5G now and so I think Mike we talked about scalability is just a huge deal and so that's really where the peplink product line comes into play I think for msps in a big way yeah they can do stuff that they couldn't do with another vendor or couldn't do before right I mean that you're taking a br1 mini or or a like from another OEM single modem device you know there's there's limitations in some of the things you can do but now with 5G and having dual 5G modem devices like the br2 and and even the br1 and and different things you you're truly like like mentioned before you truly can bring all business applications over to wireless and the failover it's yeah it's quite awesome to see absolutely so yeah LTE 5G there's tons of options in the peplink lineup and there's there's a lot more options that we're not showing here you can go much higher into you know like more traditional rack mount um Enterprise style routers so there's there's a whole lineup there available but it's a common platform it's the same features it's the same functionality just different sizes different speeds and you know different 5g's or 4GS or yeah all the different connection options but yeah again it's all a common platform and you manage that all from our in control system and so that's our cloud-based management and so it's a centralized system and so it doesn't matter which model you've got if you've got a thousand br1 Minis and 500 uh balanced 20s you can configure a single SSID for Wi-Fi for all of those units with one rule you don't have to create a policy for every model you can manage manage it as a single unit in in so many cases but still have that ability to control and customize things too so tons of tools there Mike I think there's a question that you asked earlier that I really liked and I don't know if you remember what you asked earlier but uh you know when I look at I'm not I'm not sharing a question but I I think as it was a long time yeah yeah it's when we're talking with msbs and and you're having these conversations you know one of the big pain points is you know really how do you limit truck rolls how do you limit cost from support and and these different things and and peplink with the first reliability but second the platforms and and the tools that they bring to the table really you know they'll never 100 eliminate truck rolls but the more we can decrease that the more the SS MSB is going to be uh successful and it's definitely successful in the customer's eyes right and these tools really really give you uh the power and the capability to to limit that as much as possible yeah like you said like limit truck rules right because those are expensive right if you have to send one of your technicians out to a customer's location they're not working on anything else they're driving most of the time you know it's just a huge expense to an MSP to have to send people and so you know you build these cool Wireless Solutions and you you deploy them all out everywhere and you want to know that that's going to work tomorrow and the next day still too and so as an MSP you need to make sure that that's working you need to have tools to make sure that it's working and know before your customer does if it's not working yeah and again tools remotely so you can figure out what's wrong without having to go there and so that's what it in control does for an MSP in the top right corner you can see a screenshot here I thought this was fascinating you know again it's that user experience that matters the most when you're an MSP your customer has to be happy they have to think that what they're getting is is doing what they need and so um this in control has a built-in speed test functionality so you deploy a unit out there and you want to know hey is it still fast right it was fast the day that I deployed it I did my site survey but is it going to be fast on Monday morning when they get there it's gonna be fast Tuesday morning right um but this this shows our speed test capability here we had a speed test run on this unit this 5G connection and basically you can see it gets about 300 400 Megs all through the night all through the morning and then as soon as business hours hits everything just drops right down to about 75 Megs a second so depending on when you did the install you might think oh this is a you know this site's getting 350 Megs but the reality is they're really probably only getting 75 Megs per second during the day when they're there so you know you have to be able to see these tools and and know about these things and so you can set thresholds and alerts so that you know if a customer's site isn't performing the way that you expected it to or they expect it to so yeah you said something really important there Travis but a little bit ago and that's being proactive right if you're proactive and can jump on things and and start looking into it or even contact the customer to let them know of something before they have to contact you you know you're just being looking better in their eyes and you're doing more to be you know to be a successful partner for those yep absolutely and so in control gives you those tools to be proactive to get the alerts to get the notifications and you know get the data right then and there so you know what's wrong and and how you can fix it um another nice thing within control so this is all hosted in the cloud but you can also run this privately with peplink and so for some msps you know obviously security is a concern for everybody but for some msps their customers are extremely security sensitive if they work in healthcare or government or Public Safety Industries they're not often able to accept using a public cloud service as a management system and so with peplink that's okay we can deploy the management system in just about any private environment that the customer may need and that includes things like AWS govcloud so just tons of flexibility for those there's more there's more demanding and more sensitive customers without losing functionality too yeah exactly every tool that we have in the public version is available in the private version and another great example of that is in touch and so in touch is a feature built into in control that lets you log into any devices behind a pep link so you put peplink routers out at all your customers locations but then you've got IP cameras you've got maybe a different firewall you've got servers all kinds of different devices phones lots of different things that you want to log into remotely and so with with peplink and in touch you can do that without any extra software any extra licenses any vpns it's going to ride the secure management connection from in control and let you log into remote desktop sessions or phone admin web interfaces so just one more tool again like you said like to avoid a truck roll so you can go aware deeper in the network again without extra setup or infrastructure and it's easy you can have it set up in them in minutes and and have that access at the touch of your finger so yeah yeah exactly you don't have to set anything extra up other than just tell it the IP address of the client you want to log into so another solution that we've got that msps I think will really find valuable is our speed Fusion connect data plans and so again all of our peplink devices now include esim functionality in them and so they include this esim built in that has connectivity to all three carriers in the US and actually it's a global Sim so it goes beyond the us too again T-Mobile ATT Verizon you can connect to all three of those with this speed Fusion connect data plan and we've got a pooled option so if you've got a customer who's got 10 locations you can pool all of their data connectivity so that their failover Aggregates and you pay per gig on the actual usage you're not having to buy a bucket for each location and maybe one location goes over and the other location doesn't really use anything you just pay for exactly what you use every single month and so it's just really straightforward really common sense and again it's all three carriers so you've got a platform and a connectivity solution ready to go that you don't even have to have a contract for you can just buy these you don't have to work with all three carriers so there's just really easy ways that our partners and msps can get into the data revenue streams really I mean if you're if you're an MSP and you're not selling data I think you're missing out on a huge opportunity number one yeah definitely and this also goes to the Innovation peplink's always working on first it was just allowing this right but for a while you couldn't pool and it made it challenging especially for for for deployments with multiple locations and the pooling aspect is is really just uh you know a feather in the cap to make it so much easier right and and I agree with you Travis you know if you're not capitalizing on the data piece you should and and you should talk with your with your vads and your customer or partners of how you can help or get involved in that and and this speed fusion um data pool or speech version connect is just a great way to add to the other connectivity options that that you bring to the table for your customers yeah the other I mean we see some msps use this purely as a troubleshooting connection right if their customers connection goes down for some reason and they're not sure why they can activate an esim over the air log into that remotely and get back in and troubleshoot it and so we we see people use these these pooled plans for a lot of different use cases but again it's just that ability to pool and not have to pay per Sim per month you know just kind of trashing that whole business model of just you're gonna pay for what you use every month and just like you said it's just easier yeah I love the term ignition Sim hey you know as soon as you plug it in at a site it can connect you can access and then you can configure it however you want and use that as uh you know a first failover or or or just an access if if everything else fails so yep but yeah it's it's an option there but we fully integrate with all the all the carriers and all those plans too it's not um you don't have to pick which one you use you can use any any connectivity plot any connectivity option you want really yeah um I think on that note um private 5G is another area that we really see msps starting to take action and people think about private 5G often as like another you know 5G is a Wan technology but um businesses are deploying 5G private 5G is more of a land it's like a Wi-Fi replacement it's like super Wi-Fi almost for for businesses we're seeing them deploying it in manufacturing spaces um just Outdoors large campus type networks um but yeah they want to be able to use this because it just covers so much better than Wi-Fi at Rome so much better than Wi-Fi and so there's just lots of reasons why we're seeing msps in businesses really Embrace private 5G this year and all the hardware that we've shown you already is capable of connecting to private 5G or private LTE as well so a few other things that we see out there in the market just some examples of peplink and and msps that we're working with we've got uh there's there's folks like Royal Caribbean deploying multiple starlings multiple 5G so they can stay connected as they as they move in and out of port in and out of cellular coverage but enabling that really high speed truly you know work great internet anywhere that these ships go you know that's an extreme example but again it's the same platform you can do this stuff at a big scale or a small scale yeah and that I think that's the important piece he says you know there's a lot of opportunities where it's a couple sites or small offices that works great for but it's fun to show that it can really scale into anything right and yeah and that and that slide before real really shows that where you're handling thousands and thousands of of connections on a ship and and giving them something that they've never had before which is easy and fast connectivity yep so yeah if it's you know big deployments big big vessels or it could be a whole bunch of small locations right so again pebbling can scale and we can we can handle these types of projects and you know there's all kinds of people winning projects like this already and so you know msps that aren't looking at peplink there's there's just a ton to gain there and just so many examples of other folks that are just having great success with it already yeah the opportunities are out there so I'll put a bunch of takeaways up here I think there's just a few things you know number one speed Fusion solves business problems speed Fusion is peplink's unique technology right and so we're able to come in with the unique value proposition right away that nobody else with The Cellular Connection can do right Meraki doesn't solve your zoom and teams problems even adding a cellular connection to a Meraki won't solve your zoom and teams problems but pebbling can speed Fusion well yeah and you can even use them together right yeah exactly yep that happens all the time and that's that's totally that's a totally valid use case um number two Publix got the global connectivity built in you can just ship routers over the air activate e-sims you can activate the built-in one or you can use in control to push your own third-party esim so we are just we've just launched third-party esim capability support so you can load that QR code or activation string rate from in control which is a very exciting development I mean that's good again the doors to so many more opportunities just to ease of deployment it's really quite cool yeah if you get 12 000 br1 menus to get out the door if you don't have to put SIM cards in them all of a sudden that's a huge Time Saver for an MSP cost saver yeah yeah yeah that somebody has to do that right you have to pay that person so yeah um and then you know avoiding those truck rolls things like in touch in control management those are those are your tools to avoid truck rolls and last but definitely not least with peplink and msps security is a huge deal so number one peplink can run all of our everything we've shown you can run completely in a private infrastructure Zero Internet access so even the most security conscious customers are able to say yes to peplink because again we're different we operate and build our devices to behave in those private Network environments so that you don't need internet access um so yeah very very friendly on the security policies things like PCI compliance um lots lots to offer on the security side so we'll open it up for questions um looks like we've got a couple already Travis yeah some msbs want to implement sd-wan Solutions how can we position peplink in this Arena which are the advantages regarding usd-wan Solutions compared to some of the leaders this is a good one because you know number one speed Fusion is sd-wan um we don't we don't focus on that term as much ourselves anymore just because it's a really in our eyes it's a really focused market right sd-wan is a relevant term for an Enterprise Market at a very you know very high-end Enterprise Market but more generally a lot of everybody needs speed Fusion right they need their zoom in teams to work better and so that term sd1 doesn't really speak to folks with those just kind of day-to-day problems but yeah the short answer is peplink is an sd-wan solution and we can compete with those other sd-wan focused vendors um there's plenty of examples where we've beat you know much bigger names in the sd-wan space because our technology is able to do things easier we're more fast to embrace things like starlink 5G most sd-wan companies don't have good 5G integration most of them don't have any star link integration um and so I think that's one great example of where we're able to utilize those new new modern connections much more efficiently and get better performance out of sd-wan than the traditional vendors who really built it around Wireline connections yeah and and the costs are so much higher with some of those Enterprise Solutions and and yeah they're good Solutions but there's so much there A lot of times not everyone needs it right and and peplink truly can do sd-wan it hits all checks all the boxes right but we've really chose to use the messaging right as uh if we can enhance a current sd-wan solution we can be a standalone sd-wan solution we can really do it all with the portfolio and the products solutions that that we have in the in the portfolio yeah I think cost is a huge part of it Mike I mean you know I was talking about kind of the terminology because we see this as technology that everybody needs not just the the large Enterprises but you know for everybody to be able to get that the cost has to fit too and so yeah that's the other huge difference in peplink's sd-wan solution because our cost is so much more practical for companies and I think that'll be very obvious when you start pricing out different options yeah especially as you scale I have another one esim is already available does anyone in the market have this capability cradle Point Meraki Fortinet I've seen some very limited examples from maybe one vendor like one vendor with one carrier I've seen again very limited examples of esim but um I don't know of anybody who's just third party esim compatible where you can just log in and load a third party esm to the router right right out of the gate like that I don't know anybody else who does that and I could be wrong but yeah I'd love to see an example if there is yeah and you know it's probably something that's going to become more uh available as we move forward obviously but peplink's doing such a good job at implementing into its current platforms and making it easy making it uh scalable making it a cost effective and time effective or efficient right so you know really taking that next jump of of making it and putting in your fingertips to be able to do it do it all um quickly yep and I think you said it earlier too Innovation you know people want it so we did it we pushed we got it done quick and that's that's what we try to do all the time and I I think that's important thing to touch on Travis is innovation and a lot of innovation comes from the partners from the channel from the customers that are using this day in and day out and how how receptive peplink is to feedback and and ideas and suggestions of hey maybe something's missing it may be a big so maybe a small Miss but bring it to the table bring it to the Forum you know that's that's where features that's where products that's where things are are are are hashed out and thought of right so you know don't stay silent if there's something that that's missing from from the solution to to really make your life easier bring it to the table uh whether it's through through your vat or or through the Forum you know and and and and let peplink know because that's really where things are created and how they are yeah whether that's technical or you know more business related right if it's just a pricing model issue or something there's lots of ways that I think we can still do better to help msps and so you know we're a company that listens to that feedback from the market so yeah very much not supposed to be just a closed gate of here's what we have to offer but um yeah let us know as always if there's things that we can do to improve improve your business um we've had a few asks for a copy of the presentation Travis so I don't know if you're gonna make that available yep we always anybody who registers will get a copy emailed to them or get a link to it emailed to them and then we always put it up in the Forum and we always put it up in the peplink YouTube channel as well so within a day everybody who registered whether they attended or not will get those things sent out to them and yeah great we have a question by Easton being disabled in eight three right and for troubleshooting and device Offline that makes it hard well 8-4 is coming I I think's the answer where where do you know if that's off by default in in eight four Travis I'm not sure but I'm not sure but yeah if there's an issue that sounds like a technical you know that sounds like a ticket um if there is you know a use if I guess if the implementation isn't exactly user friendly yet open a ticket and make that concern known and yeah again we listen and we move on those things so if eight four doesn't have it exactly right we will definitely push and get it get it better in the next one yeah make it right all right well I think we'll wrap it up there folks thanks again for joining and we'll see you again with our next pep talk yeah thank you"}

joining we're excited to show you what is all inside firmware 8.4 we've got as always Professor P here Peter West to lead us through this and show us all the cool new features Peter how's it going awesome um I mean uh Pittsburgh Pennsylvania right now inside a massive Conference Center so um so I'm in my my peplink speed Fusion uh Rebel vehicle and um just enjoying the nice weather up in Pennsylvania and excited to talk about 8.4 yeah I I think it's hard for everybody to kind of imagine you're in a very large vehicle inside of a massive indoor building right now yeah ice I got my 82g antennas um the day I left for this event and so I actually drove the vehicle into this huge venue and then actually was sitting on the roof drilling holes and installing the 82g antennas um so it's been it's been a really kind of exciting week as far as uh driving the Renegade and then installing these these massive 82g antennas and and then getting to talk about 8.4 so um there's a lot of new features in 8.4 um and it's relatively soon after 8.3 I was kind of expecting an 831 or an 835 um but um I think eight four is relevant because we're adding some some really good functionality here and some increased stability I think that there's going to be a lot of stability in the um 8.4 that we're seeing at least and so I'm pretty excited to to be have been testing it for several weeks now and I believe we are in rc2 so that would be release candidate two getting ready for GA um I would expect to see at least an rc3 before it goes GA um yeah what um but but we should be GA pretty soon I would I would think yeah so agreed um I know there will be an eight point or a rc3 um but I think expectations are hopefully that that's that's the one so time will tell but yeah excellent more to come very soon and should be full the cake should be fully baked shortly but there's lots yeah there's lots to talk about so let's dig into it because I know we we're going to try to we're going to try to squeeze this into the one hour time frame and not go over this time so um the first thing is uh in 884 which is a much anticipated um I wish there was like I need like CGI like fireworks shooting off right now is bring your own ESO um this is uh enabled an 8.4 and activated and in control 2.13 so it's gonna take a few extra weeks here for eight one three or two point one three firmware on in control to be released um but now with um 8.4 firmware we'll be able to bring our own esems and I've been testing this over the past couple days and I'm gonna do a real um demo of this um actually pushing an esim and activating it and showing you the user interface and kind of a a little secret that I found that it actually might exist in A3 but I'm really happy to have found an 8-4 so uh we're going to demo that nice yeah the East End thing is huge because like you said it's you know the the router itself has this e Sim chip on it and so you you know you need to be able to load an esim on there but then you know how do you do that at scale and so that's where the in control 2 side comes in so you can manage that connectivity there and yeah be able to provision those third-party esims remotely not have to insert anything so it to some it might sound some small but you know from a day-to-day operations yeah okay so fun to see Ethan finally like taking shape I actually had I was once again at this event and so I got a tech support call with a customer having a problem with one of the major carriers and I was like dang it I can't drive out like I'm at this event stuck inside of a big building and I actually just logged in updated them to 8.4 and loaded a a different carrier SIM card right into the router and so I didn't mean to do that but it it just it worked out really well and convenient um given the fact that I'm kind of sitting up here in Pittsburgh yeah I think I'll I'll talk I'll wait for the actual demo to talk more about that but yeah I love the troubleshooting aspect too that's that's a great Point yeah yeah it's pretty neat the next uh pretty pretty big announcement here is our starlink integration if you're not aware starlink has their own router and it uses a textile and I don't want to screw this up because we're live but I believe it's called grpc is that correct uh Travis I'm not sure honestly okay okay I believe it's called grpc and um and basically it's a programming language that are programming protocol that allows the starlink router to talk to the starlink dish or the modem to start to the to the router and so we are really excited to have integrated that technology into our peplink routers into 8.4 firmware which gives us insight into the starlink and the ability to actually submit actions so if you see down here you have this actions reboot and stow and so one of the biggest problems if you have a br1 pro 5G you got your starlink plugged into it and you've bypassed their router it's not easy to Stow unstow or reboot the Starling well now from in control remotely you can Stow the the starlinks as well as reboot the starlinks um and see the uid as well as software version hardware version um obstructions and more detail and so this is an incredible edit enhancement to the already amazing features inside peplink's ability to load balance and bond starlink but now we have visibility uh and control of the starlings themselves that I am I'm beyond excited about this yeah it it looks cool number one when you can just push that button and see that like it's just kind of a wow factor there but like we were talking about the the feedback that you get saying like hey there's a starlink outage and Peter will show some of this but it really kind of solves a lot of mysteries in terms of like seeing something down and understanding exactly what's going on right right away and so I'm excited for just you know the practical ways that that's going to be more useful for people hmm um so with the up and additional Institute star link um as requested by starlink Engineers we have added a new outbound policy and it is a least used policy based on Uplink so if we're trying to load balance multiple starlings together specifically like if you have two or three starlinks or 10 or 12 and you want to load balance your traffic Starling can ask us if we could instead of load balancing the traffic by download traffic which is the default least used algorithm they asked us if we could load balance based on least used on the Uplink um utilization and so now starlink or outbound policies with starlink we can have a new outbound policy based on least used on the Uplink and I will demonstrate this um uh where that is in the UI um it's it's really neat you just go to least use and then you'll have a new Option it says downlink and Uplink and you can choose do you want to least used on the downlink or least used on the Uplink and and it's it's it's once again this comes directly from starlink asking us for this feature and the idea is to optimize utilization when you have more than one Starlight um and you can see here um previously least used algorithm just had the connections and now we have this new least used mode with the by downlink and by uplink um another much anticipated feature that kind of announced Edge Computing a few months ago and um it's gaining a lot of ground especially in the docker space I kind of thought it would take gain more ground in the KVM space I I love the virtualization I've created a couple videos on this but um that we've added the ability to add USB uh support for the uh peplink device for backhand transfer your Dockers across devices so so now you can back up and use USB for Edge Computing capabilities and so um not much to really demonstrate there if you're into the docker and Edge Computing this is a nice that now we now have this capability um unless uh it's more to add on that but um I know it's been heavily requested and fearful that what do we do to back up our Docker images if you have this running on a router and so so that's I believe that's one of the key motivations behind this yep having you know everybody wants more you know there's lots of cheap affordable high quality storage options on USB so people you know naturally want that but I think the other cool thing is this just opens up the audience for folks that can actually now start using this capability if they have a router that has a USB port but maybe not that solid state drive inside now they can plug one you know plug a USB drive and actually get those Edge compute capabilities so I think it opens up more people that can start you know learning what they could do with it it's probably not something day one people will run with but yeah there's tons of things you can do with it so start playing now I have not um tested this yet I've been on the road since 8.4 and um building my lab for other scenarios um so I'm running on my ubr once my router boots back up I'm going to transfer back over to my hd4 so I can demo on the ubr but I just need to wait for my my my hd4 to boot back up here um so I am running on my my ubr but okay so so anyways I was asking about the the KVM support capabilities with the um USB I'm sure you already answered that but um for my own knowledge I guess I I lost you there mid mid questions so if if you would again please oh okay I was saying the USB support will it be for KVM as well as docker I'm almost positive it is yeah because I know there was a I mean I know one of the customers that really pushed for this feature was using KVM and they wanted you know just more storage and um on the virtual machine so okay perfect press play on a virtual machine myself using the storage but I know there's a customer using it yeah I haven't I haven't pressed play I played with with the docker but I have not actually tested KVM yet so I was uh and all of my KVM devices have that one terabyte nvme so it's it's kind of nice to have um yeah but but I haven't I haven't played with on like an mbx or anything yet um something else that comes more of an Enterprise request feature um from some of our our customers so we just we're kind of like bundling this in but we've added VLAN support on lacp so if you're if you're lacp trunking your Lan ports down into like a core switch or switch stack uh we now have um individualized VLAN support so you can actually go to vlan's custom uh on your trunk and actually choose different vlans um this request I know from one of my customers came back with 8.2.1 and so it's kind of nice to see that it's been added here um as a as a Bonafide feature um but yeah so the ability the idea here is if we're trunking or trying to get more than one gigabit of throughput on our on our RJ45 we can we can do something called lacp which will lag more than one ethernet connection together but once we did that it was a trunk all Port it would only trunk all vlans so this new support allows us to customize the vlans that can be trunked over an lacp lag sure that makes sense yeah kind of a nice little refinement yeah um so so the other thing is we have some netflow enhancements we've added some Source uh some destination ports um for netflow which I'll show you um and then we've added VLAN ppoe support um so the ability the availability sorry the availability to do ppoe over VLAN instead of just DHCP and so uh we'll we'll show you how that looks as well so on the lacp uh with the switch up link here you can see um we can lacp ethernet ports two and three and then when we go to trunk we now have the ability to click custom and we can select specific VLAN so if I don't want to trunk My untagged Lan down to a core switch but I want to lag those together I can now choose my apvlan and my VLAN 197 in this demo and can uh utilize that so very very nice yeah um with netflow we've added outgoing Wan support um this has been heavily requested um with some of our Enterprise customers especially when they're doing multi destination netflow and so now you can choose your outgoing win if you see that in the uh the right hand side of the screen here we now have the ability to choose your outgoing land so you have a particular server that you're trying to do netflow on you can choose a specific uh interface or you just continue to let us choose any and then also we can now monitor a particular Source Network so if you only want to have your netflow monitoring the untagged Lan for example you can then choose that as well so if you know what this is you're going to love it if you don't it's okay yeah this is a cyber security type of functionality for visualization into your traffic patterns I think the other cool kind of tidbit on that one is ic2 is becoming able to manage the netflow settings at in scale so that you can bulk set those network settings on the ic2 you skipped ahead a few slides I'm just here to steal the Thunder sorry Peter so yes we've now we've linked this up within control so we announced the in control 2.13 features later on I'm going to uh show that as well so it's now being manageable and in control which is a heavily requested feature um and so I'll show you that as flow um VLAN ppoe support I think the use case here is pretty slim in my opinion um but if you're using VLAN as Wan um we now have the ppoe capabilities and I believe that's primarily for like DSL and um like authentication to your ISP providers right yeah we've seen some some like dedicated internet access circuits some like um you know virtualized ethernet type of circuits sometimes use those things it's like you said it's very rare uncommon but sometimes it matters for folks so there it is excellent um we've also now I cannot tell you I believe it's been it has to be more than five years that I've been asking for this feature Travis I mean right I mean you're talking like seven one firmware that we've been asking for for more qos users I am very excited to announce that we now can support 10 qos user groups and if everybody's watching I I mean thank you peplink thank you um the ability not to have just manager staff and guests but now you can rename them and use them um in different applications and uh features inside the peplink router we so now we have the ability to have custom names as well as up to 10 groups um and there's got to be at least two or three people on this webinar that are just giggling happy right now um I love this one oh I think it's a great plug for us to summon because I think the summit really is what pushed this one onto the release schedule you know you get a group of users standing up saying this is why this is important you know it it it's hard to ignore and you know there it is so yeah it's a definitely a good plug for the summit to show up and and voice those feature requests there too and since we're talking about the summit if you just Google tech Summit 2000 or 2023 uh it'll take you to our landing page in November 6th through the 8th Travis are you joining me I think I will be okay so we're gonna have our our second annual Tech Summit in Savannah Georgia and this stuff comes right out of this I mean the ability to to provide real feedback and talking as a community um we're also going to do the PCA 8.4 training but more importantly getting together as a community and talking about features that we need um to improve our workflows and our and our capabilities um but yes these features do come right out of that and um this is definitely not a sales pitch for the summit so I'll stop it at that but it was you know this feature um it was heavily requested and pushed and it's it's nice to see that peplink not only listened but they did a really great job of implementing it they didn't just add the ability to change the names they actually put it through multiple areas of of the qos functionality and I'll show that off here in just a little bit yeah nice um the other thing is um Enterprise features uh Prime Care update certain models are now retain speed Fusion licensing after its prime care subscription has expired um and so this is really nice of peplink and that's the only thing I can say about that right something that's supposed to be a subscription something you're supposed to pay for peplink now says Ah you can have it forever it's okay and all I can say is just thank you peplink that's a really I mean it's just awesome it just shows the the type of company that they are um so thank you Travis because you're puffling so yeah I'm here to steal Thunder and take credit I guess some additional functionality and 8.4 and you can see why they've changed this to 8.4 because we're just going after feature release after feature release after feature release we now have um our sfc relay with access controls um so in other words now sfc relay is great for connecting your home network and getting you on board um like letting you use your home Wi-Fi so a while here at the event I used sfc relay to connect to my home network and actually was streaming the football game for everybody here and they just thought it was the coolest thing in the world and it looked like I was coming right from my house so my my provider thought I was coming from Gainesville Florida and didn't flag my account or say that I was in the wrong uh geo location um and so that's just one really simple use case but now they've added the ability to access controls which lets you control which networks you can access on that on your whole network um so it's a great additional security feature for something that was really intended just to act as a a bonding host for uh consumer access yeah um we've now added more applications to sfc protect so we've added FaceTime Google meet and zscaler um so you can now traffic shape um and uh by by DPI or layer 7 aware um traffic shaping with uh within speed Fusion connect protect profiles and I'll show those off in here in just a minute um we've also added a I actually don't know what qol means is that quality of life what that's yes I think that's what that was intended to be not my acronym but um yeah in the in the next firmware release oh Creature Comforts like hey just a benefit quality of life yeah like you know the poe on the on the WAN Port I mean you could have done it enough way before but now it's much more convenient um yeah just so in previously when I was testing the the Synergy mode with Poe I had to do way um uh VLAN and then and then Poe enable it and that way I could launch the the HD uh the caddy or the 5G HD1 uh Pro e on my mbx mini now you can actually just turn on Poe on that land that Lan Port so you don't need to waste a VLAN license on that um and additionally especially the fusion Hub a big complaint is the fusion Hub solo is free button it needs to be renewed every year and so paplink has made the ability to renew Fusion Hub licenses right from in control and that's that's great yep um oh good no we're good there okay and then and then finally like another little creature Comfort feature um InTouch has been growing dramatically at least in my world in the Enterprise world I've been seeing in touch adopted and replacing typical out-of-band management platforms and adding that functionality but we've had an increase in people asking for hey can we can I have a switch out in the field I've got an AP out of the field can I in touch using that other peplink device and rather than installing an entire router um and the answer now is yes so with the latest um 3.93 firmware and the latest 1.31 firmware from um on the switches in the AP respectively you can now enable in-touch controls from those devices so if you have an AP sitting behind a non-pepalink router you can actually in touch devices through that that AP and you can also um do it with the SD switches so just and further enhancing that out-of-band management capabilities of in control and in touch yep I love that because it could be anything router on that other side right and you just plug in a coupling access point pebbling switch and yeah now it's going to behave you know you've got that same exact InTouch capability yeah it's it's really neat so sfc uh relay access control um so we've kind of announced it so this is sort of what it looks like when you go into your sfc protected and go to relay mode you would select or um relay enablement and now you get this network access function this access control so you can say which networks are they allowed to access and your vlans will drop down right here you can do device access you can allow incoming devices and then you can um you can add their serial numbers and then you can also do allowed devices by serial number there so a little better access control um for the devices that connect to your environment as well as um what they can do and access um an sfc protect we've also added or enhanced route by Wi-Fi SSID so with the latest AP firmware um that 393 and the AP controller enabled on the router you can now do route by SSID and it'll work on the aps connected to your network so not not just the 20x and the built-in AP but you also now have like if you have an apax that's attached to your network and you're using route by SSID you can now that will now work on those external APS to your router we've also increased ethernet port status um support for various devices um allowing users to view the status of ethernet ports under status ethernet ports so um this has sort of been I don't know it's been around but not around enabled but not enabled on some devices over the past couple firmwares so peplink is increasing that capability to more than uh more more routers and adding some functionality like you can see that the device is up and that it's negotiated at gigabit so it's just kind of kind of nice you know visual um capability to see the status of your ethernet ports and I'll tell you from remote support I've had people plug a Wan Port into a lan Port often and I can pull this up and go oh I see that nothing's plugged into the WAN Port can you just move that over to the land the Lan port and then they move it over and sure enough the network works um so sometimes you just have it's just a nice visual capability to see what's going on speed Fusion bonding has been added with the following models for PrimeCare so the br1 mini Hardware three the core Hardware three and the transit Mini 3 now have speed Fusion bonding um with PrimeCare and so that's a great way to aggregate your cable modems or starlink with um cellular we can now Bond those together so that's just a nice little add-on feature there's no extra cost if you have a router and you have 8.4 firmware and you have Prime pure you're you're good to go you get this extra feature so that's that's really nice um we also added support for different priority levels and application cues and you can see there are a ton of features being added here um in this firmware it's just absolutely crazy um so we added application cues in 8.3 and that was really fun to announce um and I believe when we announced that Travis both you and I were like what like like kind of like the application utilization and ever since we announced it we've just gotten tons of positive feedback and and companies using it for teams optimization and and video streaming our broadcast customers can dedicate um application queuing for their their app their their broadcast applications and I'm sure there's tons of other use cases for it um and so but now it's can we add a queue but then give it a priority and so we've added priorities to the application queuing further making that even more powerful and useful for your business applications they're kind of neat more features we've added support for different priority levels in application cues um when they're deployed so now instead of just your queue being listed you can now have your queue listed in the priority um like I mentioned and you can see that here so you have your high high priority application cues your normal application cues and your low application application cues and you can see how that's applied to the YouTube application um so kind of kind of neat feature there and I'll kind of show that real quickly if we have enough time but I've got a couple things I want to show okay in control 2.3 there's been no spoilers on this conversation about in control 2.13 so uh let's dig into that in control 2.3 is currently in the in the beta phase uh means that it's on Venus um do not put your devices on Venus to play with this um if you're a partner and you're and you have access great but it is beta uh we we were doing some testing with Venus a couple weeks ago and it took some stuff down and customers or Partners were complaining that's what it's for do not run your your production networks on Venus it's just a little partner shout out there this is a consumer conversation but Partners be aware Venus is what that's how we test it so we need and sometimes it will break um if you want more reliable Earth is the most stable if someone the last um uh in controls to receive updates and so all production networks should be on either Earth or Mars and then you can run testing on Venus if you have access to business that being said 2.13 is a pushed out to Venus for testing and for allowing for us to demonstrate this and so we've added inbound firewall rules based on SAS applications this was direct partner feedback uh or customer feedback I should say um needing secure uh inbound connectivity based on these SAS applications and so we have now added this feature and you can see that now you can do um an inbound rule you can do Source SAS and then you can select the applications that you want to allow inbound so that's pretty cool I I think that was neat that that was requested and then very very quickly actually added yeah um outbound rules um I actually was making fun of this a little bit in my last uh my PCA training videos that I was making that peplink had this amazing ability to do client and um SSID and type in the GUI but it wasn't an in control and then about about two hours later I got a notification that 2.13 was out and sure enough there's client type and client SSID so peplink added the ability to do outbound policies based on client type so I could say hey phones follow this policy smart screens follow this policy so which that's a I don't know who came up with that idea Travis but that is really convenient to be able to tag the type of device that's on your network and if something's miscategorized you can actually click on it and change the category so you can re-categorize a device and fix it and I think that updates a database somewhere right like that actually kind of learns the devices it's just awesome to be able to say like hey Smart TVs don't use this when or do use a swan and yeah done and um I'm gonna get into a demo if you don't mind I'm gonna connect back to my hd4s to my qualities better um it's good enough now um so I'm just gonna swap back over to my to my hd4 real fast it's just going to interrupt my network mm-hmm but in the meantime I am just pounding away on these q a responses here so if you put questions in there and worry not we're working through them okay I'm switched over I think Zoom state right are we good yeah you're here okay okay I just wanted to get off the ubr because I'm going to do a demo on the ubr and I wanted to make sure I wasn't on the ubr um okay so so we've added the ability in in control now to do access control list client type and Associates Associated SSID so what I was saying was the outbound policy rules now in in control 2.3 we have access control list client type and Associates Associated SSID is now added to outbound policies and in control which is phenomenal because that feature was added to um started being added in eight three and now it's published and uh in control 2.13 which is very convenient e-sim Activation so we added esem support in 8.4 and in control 2.13 now has the activation and I'm actually going to demonstrate this and show you a couple of secrets that I found um that weren't clearly visible to Me Maybe other people would be but for me it was not clearly visible and so I wanted to actually do a live demonstration of esim support and how to activate that but basically you go to the router that supports esims you go to settings and device tools and then you'll see this e-sim Activation so if you have if your router is running 8.4 you're in in control 2.13 and your router supports esims you should see esim activation right here um once you do that you can scan you can actually open your camera and scan the QR code or you can input it manually then you activate it and it will tell you that it it worked then I will demonstrate that and show you how to then choose the e-sems on the router we've also added simple by all carriers which is kind of neat and this is I think really important for like mvno type operations right where you have something that can be ATT Verizon T-Mobile or any other country but you have 100 gigs of data the ability to say all carriers allows you to have to manage that a little bit better I would assume that's the real the main use case here um so um there might be others but I just think that that's a good use case and then uh We've also added netflow support directly into in control so now we can push um netflow information directly into in control and allow that to be centrally managed and that is heavily requested it's been requested for many many months for me or for my customers and because you got to log into every router and set those netflow options and so now that is centrally managed right inside device manager right with your SNMP your logging your url logging and everything else it's now right under device um uh system management and you can just scroll down to netflow and centrally manage your netflow options things are one of those little nitty-gritty things that when you're managing a thousand routers way better exactly so I'm going to show you a couple of these features um I we I did go through that enough to give us some time so I'm glad I get to do that so the first I'm going to do is show you um esim activation now I've already activated cellular one so I'm going to push cellular2 right now so you're going to get a code um that that you use that you can use to activate or a QR code um either one works this is just what I have so I'm going to copy that code and then in my ubr I'm going to go to settings device tools and then I got my e SIM activation and you can have multiple profiles by the way on each cellular so I could have a Verizon profile an ATT profile and a T-Mobile profile on cellular one um so you so that's something else I learned while playing around but I'm gonna go to cellular2 click input manually I'm going to paste my code and I'm going to hit submit it does take a second it's going to push that esem and program that I guess in the router so and you won't see it there it goes you uh profile activated successfully you won't see esim if the router is not online it will not let you the router has to be on and connected to in control for this to show up so once it shows once it's been pushed it says the esim uh profile activated successfully I can then go to my device details settings remote web admin and there's two things I learned here so I'm kind of excited to be able to share this because one of the things that I didn't know and it's probably been around for a while but until I started playing with esims or this is new in 8.4 so maybe Travis can shed some light but customizing APNs and cellular settings first for sfc protect um if you click on cellular2 which I've now loaded my esem you'll see here I've added this new SIM card BYO bring your own SIM card a I can load multiple profiles here but also what I've learned is that if on the down here in your cellular options if you scroll to the right look you get all the options for all the the different connections you have so one of the things I was always worried about was you had a and b but then what how did you program RSM and fusion Sim and the speed Fusion connect well if you just scroll to the right I don't know why I've never seen this and it's so funny but I wanted to show everybody you can see uh remote Sim Fusion Sim speed Fusion connect and then boom there's my bring your own sim a and I can now program those settings if I need to right here and that is amazing one and two I now have another I mean look at all the redundancy I have on a single modem I have semi symbi remote Sim Fusion Sim speed Fusion connect LTE and BYO esen a and if I added a T-Mobile there it'd be byos e7b and I mean I have I have more redundancy in one modem than most people have in their entire router yeah yep it's awesome yeah and I mean that you're right like that it's just hard to see right that that scroll window is unfortunate but yeah it's it's also great because it's there it and it's you know you can you plug those settings in so yeah the UI maybe has grown Beyond a little bit uh what it's uh capable of now but yeah great but now that I know it's there it's super easy yep it's there yeah um so really cool uh I I just really enjoy that feature um and then the other thing I wanted to demo was um the qos functionality so in that in that case I'm going to run over to my hd4 and the slides it's exciting to announce qos but I wanted to show you all the areas the qos applies and that's why I wanted to live demo this not just tell you about it but also once again the purpose of these videos is to to just tell you about new technology but then show you how it applies um and so if we go to our my hd4mvx 5G I can go to my Advanced tab and I can go to user groups down here and so now if you notice a big difference here is manager Staffing guests are now changeable so I could say um uh Finance it uh Warehouse uh guest Network or something variant there I just wanted to add a fourth and then you can add you have a total of 10 here um so you hit save changes and now under bandwidth control once I've done that I can now go to um individual bandwidth limits and look now I've got all my my tags the finance which is always going to stay unlimited um so that's that's there but um but now I can do individual um throttle limits for up to 10 groups with the exception of the manager which I just renamed Finance um you never want to throttle your Finance team by the way um yeah right um and so now I can assign up to 10 different individual bandwidth limits there uh which is really nice it does not affect the group reservation bandwidth this this gets we did some playing around it gets too complicated so group bandwidth reservations is only limited to the three so the 10 applies to individual limits but not group uh reservation limits additionally under application queuing we already talked about this a little bit we now have the ability to do um borrow spared bandwidth and priorities so I can create a group with bandwidth so I can have uh 10 megabits per second High and say this gets 10 Megs and it is high priority and then I could do a 10 megabits per second low and it gets low priority and that's the idea is I can create these application Crews uh cues and I give them priority within the application crew queues themselves and then once I go to the application capab here I can add an application and then I I now see that there's my cue that my 10 megabits high or my 10 megabits low so if I want to give them 10 megabits per second of low low priority bandwidth to my streaming protocol there I hit OK and then voila now they get 10 megabits but it's lower than the high like a high high application queue so I find that really really neat yep that's awesome um yeah yeah it's really really nice to be able to to manage that and have that capability to to better tune your your traffic and I think that just goes into that that kind of that I was gonna say exemplary but you know that like the the key differences between peplink and maybe some other uh Solutions is that you're really controlling that flow of traffic and data not not just on the land side but really like how it operates inside your network and the priorities that your users get in that that ultimate user experience yep yeah there's um it's kind of like qos on the win and qos on the land and there's you know different strategies speed Fusion is kind of qos on the WAN right traditional mechanisms in 5G and starlink networks but on the land side yeah you send it out the door and the priority and it just makes everything work better so the next thing I want to show you was um outbound policies by client type so I can click on my outbound policies here and here I just have a bonding policy going over speed fusion um my speed Fusion but my smart TVs and things like that if I didn't want them bonded I could actually create a policy smart TVs and I've done this by the way for a lot of my RV customers that are using starlink so that's what I'm going to do here I can say at the source is a client type and it's an audio video which it seems to classify TVs um so Source client type audio video um destination any and then here I could say uh priority when and I could send it over my starlink when one and so I'm saying hey if it's a television and starlink is available I want you to use Starlight like you know it's it's gonna it's gonna use TCP acceleration is not going to suck up my cellular bandwidth and it's going to dedicate more traffic towards my zoom and teams meetings and other business applications that might be dependent on that bonded capabilities and so um client type is a a really nice way to to just take a classification of device and send it over a Wan or send it out a different different path without having to worry about the specific IP address or Mac address yep um the other one is the client Associated SSID and so I have these ssids I could create another SSID called um Renegade bonding choose that SSID and then go send that traffic out my bonded connection and so then I just say hey if you connect to the bonded Wi-Fi you're going to get bonded like and it doesn't matter what your network is they could all be on the same network it's the tag so if I'm connected to this wi-fi and I'm also on the untagged network I can still control the flow of that traffic and that is really cool because you don't have to create a whole bunch of different vlans which affect like apple print like bonjour like apple and things like that all your devices can still talk to each other but I'm controlling how those devices use the internet yep yeah I think you summed it up right there you just make it so much easier to achieve the same kind of experience and yeah you don't break Printing and all these other things that everybody expects to work yeah and it's very common right it's like oh I want to control the flow okay we neither need a VLAN tag right or we need a DHC Reserve you now it's oh let's just create a bonded Wi-Fi and send you out or let's tag your device your smartphones or whatever and send that traffic out I've had customers actually use the smartphone for like especially like healthcare like hey if they connect to smartphones send it out the regular internet don't don't let that go over the VPN um and so we've had some really neat use cases where we're able to enhance security by by moving those devices off their um their their corporate traffic we have a few more minutes is there anything else we want to talk about or you want to go into questions because we have a lot of questions those are the three things I wanted to demo outside of highlighting function I think we'll do some q a okay yeah I think anything um anything on the starlink side is always good to show too [Music] um oh yeah let me let me show that there thank you so um so on my Renegade I'm inside a building which means my starlink is not going to work and this is really cool because you can see there it says starlink outage like I think that's so cool um and then I can show you how to turn this feature on so if we go to the uh my peplink router and I go to the network tab and then I go down to WAN so this is different than the dashboard where you see all your wands you can see right here you have these Advanced Wan options so we've all we've had IPv6 for a long time we've had DNS over https for a long time the WAN quality we announced an 8.3 a Synergy mode we announced an 8.3 and now you have starlink so starlink is now you can click edit and turn on the wands that you want to monitor with grpc and it'll actually check that wan to see if there's a starlink modem Starling dish Upstream um and so from that from that device another thing that peplink did is we now have Synergy over VLAN as Wan so under Synergy mode you can turn on VLAN as Wan right there so if you um it's been a heavily requested feature for Synergy over VLAN as Wan and so you can just uh check that box now and access um Synergy mode over VLAN is Wan um so those are kind of two new enhancements on the WAN settings within the starlink and then once you do that and in control you can see there's my starlink outage or my starlink connection let me drag this over if I click details I get my my starlink ID my hardware version my software version my uptime um my fraction of obstructions my outage uh the current utilization and then I can reboot my starlink or Stow my starlink and we've had issues with uh managing a bunch of different star links especially the the hp's and these standards where we had to unplug our pep link plug in the peplink route the the starlink router log into the starlink router and click Stow so we could pack it up and move it now you can Stow all your starlinks right from the peplink uh in control interface um so that's a really nice feature um that we've added in that and that um and in control 2.13 with the 8.4 uh Wan activation in starlink I love the mobility detection too because sometimes you just don't know it's like is this my Mobility dish or you know when you start working with multiple discs oh yes details that can just be hard to figure out in the moment and detail hope it's not it's not on the patient my Patriot has a as a starlink as well and it's it's up in uh Philadelphia and it might be driving but it's offline right now but the um yeah so if you're roaming it'll tell you roaming um and so um so it you know you can you get more details about the device um outside of just uh booting so um do you have any good I mean I see 40 questions um Travis how many of these I plowed through a bunch and answered them and then I then we got to talking again so let's see what else we've got in here funny one what are you doing at the in Pittsburgh and there's a trees and utilities I'm at the mobile Health Clinic Association so we're talking about mobile health clinics are a big deal for me and so I'm I'm at the mobile Health Clinic Association um for that one let's see when is ic2.13 going live like Peter said that is on it doesn't officially have a date yet um so 2.13 you can see right there um it's uh it was pushed out to Venus I don't have a a date a published date yet I think it's based on I believe it's going to be based on 8.4 GA is in my assumption show them that little thing that you just did one more time I want people to see that I think that's fun so any control um you click on the little notification you know if you watch uh you watch YouTube right click on notification um yeah you see the notification Bell icon in the top right hand corner it will not subscribe you um you click on that and it's gonna give you all of the changes um that have that have kind of recently released um and what's going on but it also gives you the release dates so we know when uh software is being pushed once again because there's no release date for 2.13 on Mars and Earth I believe this is associated to the ga and it'll be timed with the ga of 8.4 because they're very closely linked you really can't have 8.4 without 2.13 and 2.13 without 8.4 doesn't really do any good um and so I'm assuming that we're gonna see uh as soon as 8.1 8.4 firmware gets a ga date I I'm pretty sure you're going to see Mars on Earth um get their dates as well yeah exactly but yeah that's that's where that always is and you know even when you're not in a current you know a new release cycle you can go back and look at those notes up there too so nice little tidbit I just wanted to point that out um somebody asked a really neat question are we allowed to share good news from the peplink webinars definitely we are announcing this uh publicly um this webinar will go live and you're more than happy to um Post online the only thing I ask is that when we do these webinars live I am sharing my information and my routers um when we publish these we we mask out my my serial numbers and stuff um so please don't post my serial numbers online um if you do screenshot or something like that that would be the only request there um yeah I think one thing I'd say there too like um just the way it's worded there like the free speed Fusion announcement I would make sure that you know you're you're capturing what the announcement is and not just posting screenshots of slime yeah screenshots of slides really don't add context and they don't really explain everything that's um you know it's not free it's people that have bought prime or have a router that has Prime Care and then with 8.4 and then you know you're gonna keep that yeah uh yeah I I guess personally I'm hesitant to post screenshots of slides because it just isn't really that's not how we delivered it in the webinar and it's not an accurate representation externally so if you need materials you know based on a slide ask our marketing department those are things that we very likely could change slightly to I think really capture that message in a you know just a static image as well so yeah or um we've got a question and they move quick so yeah if you want help yeah let us know the great question here is uh 2.13 required for starlink Stowe yes uh 2.13 and 8.4 is required for starlink uh grpc integration um so those two things need to be working together for that to um uh to work someone asked for esim demo I believe that I completed that so we should be good there hmm Sterling power injector somebody was asking how you would do like do you have to have the starlink router oh so if you have an HP or an FHP you get a starting power supply um and I have a starlink video that I go over that if you're running a standard star link you have the router with a little USB dongle um and then you can plug that in there are um non-official widgets that you can buy that buy um starlink router for the standard that basically injects Poe um and there's a lot of different YouTubers out there that talk about that um and so this just allows you to interact with that but um you would with a standard star link you would need the router because that is the power supply so you would need to to somehow have a power supply if you have the FHP or the HP the flat high performance or the high performance that comes the power supply and a router and so you don't need the router in that scenario with peplink I think yeah that's a good point there's a lot of different dishes and combinations yeah and I do have a I do have a webinar that I released going over all the dishes and the plans and connecting them up so if you want to check that out at Republic University you can you can check that out like And subscribe um yeah like like And subscribe click that notification Bell yes so someone asked a really neat question is there a way to have two peplink routers one at home and one with me at a different location and make my home internet The Hub the answer is speed Fusion relay um that's uh so we just talked about that um speed Fusion uh protect relay allows you to set your home router as a hub or as the speed Fusion Hub and then your peers or your remote routers can then um connect to the home and it's all done through the sfc option and in controls or in the router so under sfc protect you can set up your relay mode so that'd be at your house and then you would set up client mode on your Remote device so you'd set up reload mode first and you're gonna when you do that like say if I just hit check here you're gonna get a a relay sharing code right there you copy that sharing code at your from your home router and then on the client mode you have automatic but you also have relay sharing and then you put in that code right there that's going to establish a connection using speed Fusion protect from your remote router to your home route and then you can do outbound policies and a bunch of stuff at kind of a different topic for this video um well we're running up the end of the hour here so I will just say we love to answer questions um Travis peplink.com Peter westnetworks.com uh and or you can comment on this video when it gets published on YouTube and we'd be more than happy to answer any additional questions um but otherwise I hope you enjoy 8.4 as much as I have enjoyed uh talking about it and the features and I look forward to sharing uh your feedback here soon when it goes live any final stuff uh for you uh Travis now just thanks everybody it's great and yes all the testing and feedback and you know feature requests so um it's just fun to see it showing up and yeah can't wait for it to go ga you're right so and follow I mean social media Twitter Youtube or Twitter and um like LinkedIn we publish all this stuff so if you want to know when 8.4 is going GA just follow peplink on Twitter uh you can also follow westnetworks on Twitter um as well as uh LinkedIn and um Instagram I believe and we we publish that information out there as well so if you just want to keep up with us on that um we're gonna we'll talk about it there as well thank you very much and have a great rest of your day yes have a good show Peter"}

{"topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "in this video I will demonstrate how to set up and configure route advertisement before I get started with the demo let me explain what route advertisement is the purpose of Route advertising is to share available routes that exist on the Enterprise Network with other routers this assists the routers with making routing decisions routing protocols facilitate the collection of neighboring router information which is then advertised for all other nodes via the network in simple terms this feature is used for routers to learn of the existence of neighboring routers allowing for efficient routing of data and packets therefore this feature is commonly used in Enterprise applications or deployments rather than for personal Networks peplink routers support several routing protocols including ospf rip V2 and bgp ospf and rip V2 are both interior Gateway protocols what this means is that they allow users to exchange routes with other routers in the network on the other hand peplink routers also support bgp routing which is an exterior Gateway protocol this means that it allows for the exchange of routes between routing domains on the internet that being said bgp can also be used for sharing internal routes as well so what is ospf ospf which stands for open shortest path first is a link state routing protocol that is used to find the best path between the source and the destination router using its own shortest path first as mentioned previously it is an interior Gateway protocol meaning that it aims to move packets within a large autonomous system or routing domain it is a network layer protocol that works on protocol number 89 and uses ad value 110. there are a few criterias for the router in order to use ospf the first criteria is that both routers should be present in the same area the second requirement is the subnet mask should be the same also the hello and dead timer should be the same the sub flag must also match for both routers and finally the authentication must match as well the advantages of using ospf are that you can use load balancing with equal cost routes for the same destination vlsm and Route summarization is possible unlimited hop counts are available you can trigger updates for fast convergence you can use loot free topology using the SPF algorithm it runs on most routers and finally it is a classless protocol now I'll briefly describe ripv2 rip which stands for routing information protocol is an interior Gateway routing protocol as well used by routers to exchange routing information rip uses hop count as a routing metric the maximum number of hops allowed for rip is 15. this hop limit essentially limits the size of networks that rip can support ripv2 is the second version of rip and differs from rip V1 in the following ways firstly rip V2 is a classless routing protocol whereas rip V1 isn't ripv2 includes subnet masks in the routing update ripv2 multicasts the entire routing table to all adjacent routers 224.0.0.9 the advantages of using rip V2 is that it is a standardized protocol it's vlsm compliant it provides fast convergence meaning that it sends triggered updates when the network changes finally it works with snapshot routing making it ideal for dial Networks last but not least I'll go over what bgp is and its advantages bgp stands for Border Gateway protocol this is a gateway protocol that enables the internet to exchange routing information between autonomous systems bgp takes into consideration all the different peering options a router has and chooses the one closest to where the router is each potential peer communicates the routing information it has and that gets stored within a routing information base bgp can access this information and use it to choose the best peering option a key benefit of using bgp is that it can find the best path compared to ospf which finds the fastest another benefit is the fact that it is extremely flexible and also has the ability to do load balancing before we get started it is also important to understand what speed Fusion VPN routing isolation is speed Fusion VPN isolation is essentially a method to stop exchanging routing tables automatically by isolating speed Fusion VPN peers from each other received speed Fusion VPN routes will not be forwarded to other speed Fusion VPN peers to reduce bandwidth consumption it is important to note that enabling the speed Fusion VPN route isolation function will only hide routing information between speed Fusion VPN peers if you want to fully block interspeed Fusion VPN traffic you should configure your firewall instead before I start the demo today I'll go through the network topology for the ospf demo our Network topology today consists of three peplink routers we have the max HD2 the balance 20x and the Max br1 Mini the br1 mini is connected to the Lan Port of the balance 20x and the balance 20x is connected to the max HD2 via one there is a speed Fusion tunnel between the balance 20x and the max HD2 the goal of today's demo is to make the max HD2 learn the routing from the max br1 mini ospf via speed Fusion the first step for me would be to create a speed Fusion tunnel between the max HD2 and the balance 20x as this video isn't focusing on setting up a speed Fusion tunnel I will skip this step if you want to know how to create a speed Fusion tunnel then please watch My Demo for that I've added the link to the description below so once the speed Fusion Tonneau has been set up between those devices I can go to the web admin page for the Max br1 Mini then I can confirm the network settings under the network tab after that I can go to the advanced Tab and then go to the routing protocol section here we have two options the first tab is for configuring the ospf and rip V2 settings the second tab is for configuring the bgp settings to enable the ospf or rip V2 routing you need to head to the ospf and rip V2 tab once you've done that you can define a new ospf area for ospf routing by clicking new ospf area after clicking that you'll see the option for creating a new area ID also you can decide the type of link you want to create whether it's broadcast or point-to-point a point-to-point network type is as its name implies a connection between two specific points or ospf routers on a point-to-point link a packet delivered from one of the routers will always have precisely one recipient it does not maintain a dbbdr relationship and it has a 10 second hello and 40 second dead timer least lines running point-to-point protocol and high-level data link control are some examples of point-to-point links the broadcast network type is the default network type for an ospf enabled ethernet interface it requires a link that supports layer 2 broadcasts it requires the use of a drbdr relationship and has a 10 second low and 40 second dead timer for this demo I'll be selecting the default option which is the broadcast link type below that you can also select the authentication method the options include none text and md5 the difference between the last two options are that text is not encrypted where clear text passwords are used but for md5 on the other hand it is encrypted with md5 md5 which stands for message digest algorithm 5 will generate a 128-bit hash value to make the password more secure for this demo I will be selecting none as it is just a demo finally you can select the interfaces this is to decide who should join the exchange the options will include untaglan VLAN Wan or pet VPN for rip V2 routing you can select the authentication method and interfaces in the section below the configuration options are the same as ospf for the max br1 mini since it is connected to the balance to ntx through the br1 minis 1 Port I will be selecting one for this option in the section below you can select specific networks which will be advertised over ospf and rip V2 if no network is selected all Lan VLAN networks will be advertised by default for the max br1 mini I've selected VLAN 33 and the untagged Lan that was shown on the network settings page earlier I will also enable static route advertising and insert the subnet mask for the balance 20x I will create the new area and the ospf and rip V2 page but this time the selected interfaces will be the untagged Lan which is the connection to the br1 menu and also the speed Fusion VPN option which is a connection to the max HD2 then for the route advertisement section below I will keep it the same this way all the Lan VLAN networks will be advertised with no network advertising is chosen finally for the max HD2 I need to go to the same tab on the web admin page for that device then for the interfaces under the ospf settings I will only have the speed Fusion VPN selected as it is the only route available for this device then for the final table it will be the same as the balance device except for the fact that I need to enable static route advertising and insert the relevant subnet mask once that is complete you will have finished setting up your ospf routing configuration to confirm that it is working head to the status Tab and check under the ospf and rip V2 settings here you can see that all my devices are aware of all the possible routes in this network and it is currently operating with ospf for my bgp demo as shown on the screen the network topology will be different for this demo I will only be using two devices I will have my balanced one TX connected to the Max br1 Mini the cable will be connected to the Lan Port of the balance 20x and the WAN Port of the br1 Mini the purpose of doing so is to make the b20x learn the routing of the Max pr1 Mini to set up bgp routing you need to head to the bgp tab under routing protocols the first step would be to create a new profile I will be starting off with the balance 20x model first for the bgp setup it is split into four main sections the first one is the basic bgp profile here you can insert a profile name select the interface and insert a router ID also it is important to input the device's autonomous system number also known as ASN under the relevant section then for the part labeled as neighbor you need to fill in a table the first two columns are for entering IP addresses the ASN and the other information for bgp Neighbors so here I will be inserting the max br1 minis one IP and ASN in the third column you have the choice to enable multi-hop TTL if enabled you need to enter a time to live value between 2 and 255. if the neighbor is not on the same network the fourth column is for passwords if needed you can insert a password for md5 authentication over the bgp session if a password isn't required you can leave it empty the final column is for as path for pending here it makes you insert a comma separating local ASN to be prepended to the as path when propagating routes to Neighbors the next section in the bgb profile configuration is for setting up hold time this is the time required to wait for a keep alive message from a neighbor before considering the bgp connection is staled the value needs to be in seconds and must be either zero which is infinite whole time or between 3 and 65 535 inclusively the default setting is 240 seconds The Next Step would be to enable or disable the next hop self setting this is the option to advertise your own source address as next hop when propagating routes the final two configurations for setting up the bgb profile are ibgp local preference and the BFD the ibgp local preference is the metric advertised to ibgp neighbors to indicate the preference for external routes the value must be between 0 to 4 billion 294 million 967 295 inclusively but the default setting is 100 finally enabling the BFD is to add bi-directional forwarding detection for path failure detection all directly connected neighbors use the same physical interface and share the same BFD setting all multi-hop neighbors share the same multi-hot BFD settings you can configure bft settings in the bgp profile listing page after this option is enabled the next section on this page is the route advertisement section the first row allows you to select the type of network that will be advertised the next row is for enabling static route advertising which is the option to advertise land static routes here you can input additional routes to be advertised to the bgp neighbor the next row which is called advertise ospf route which if enabled can provide you the option to advertise ospf routes the final part of this section is set community this assigns communities to matched prefixes the next section of this page is for Route import here you have the option to filter networks for this configuration there are four options you can select none accept reject or exact match by selecting none then no networks will be filtered by selecting accept listed networks will be accepted if you select reject then listed networks will be rejected finally if you select exact match then only routes with the same networks and subnet masks will be filtered otherwise routes within the network and subnets will be filtered the final section in the bgb configuration is for Route export this section has been split into three parts there is the first part which is to select the filter mode the options are the same as the route import section then there's also export to other bgb profiles this is the option to export bgp routes to other bgp profiles finally there is also the option to export bgp routes to ospf now that the balance 20x has been set up I will move on to setting up the bgp profile for the Max pr1 Mini when I go to the bgp tab for the max pr1 mini I will see the bgp profile that I already created on the web admin of my balance model now I have to add another profile but this time I need to input the max br1 minis ASN in the appropriate section then for the section about neighbors I need to put the balance20x's Lan IP and ASM then I also need to export the network by adding the IP address in the network advertising section in my case I need to add the VLAN ID so that the devices can communicate with each other and share routes finally to check the bgp status head to the status tab on web admin and click on bgp here you will be able to see the status of the profiles you set up it is important to check on the imported or exported routes and the Lan and one IP address if I'm looking at the bgp status for my balance20x's web admin page then I'll be looking at the imported routes if I'm looking at the bgp status for my Max br1 Mini then I'll be looking at the exported routes in both cases for me the number should be one since I only have one other device"}

"transcript": "in this video I'll explain what high availability mode is also known as ha mode I will also demonstrate how to set it up ha mode allows a slave unit in the Lan to take over the role when failure is detected in the corresponding Master unit providing Hardware redundancy aha failover between two routes is based on the vrrp which is the Virtual Router redundancy protocol this is where a heartbeat is sent out from the master device the router configured as the slave device the router configured as a slave will then take over the master device's role and the heartbeat is missing for example when the hardware failure or the router with the master role is disconnected from the LAN this feature is very useful for industries that require stable connections and cannot afford any downtime in their Networks my network topology is as shown over here two balanced 20x devices will be used and they are both connected to the switch the first balance 20x is the master device while the second one will act as a slave device to set up the master device the first step is to go to the web admin page for that device then head to the network or Advanced tab depending on the device that you're using next under the miscellaneous settings you will see high availability click on that here you need to enable the mode and select the preferred role whether it will act as the master device or the slave device since I'm setting up the master device I will select the master option then you can also set up the group number and virtual IP address as shown here a virtual IP address is an IP address that doesn't correspond to an actual physical network interface the virtual IP address is the default gateway for all hosts connected to the line segment it is important to remember that the age a pair must use the same group number another crucial point to remember is that the ha pair must share the same virtual IP address this virtual IP address and the Lan Administration IP address must be under the same network there's also another option to resume the master role upon recovery when this option is enabled the original Master unit will take over the master role from the original slave unit after rebooting when this option is not enabled the preferred slave unit will remain as the master until it is powered off then you can go ahead and save the settings and apply changes the next step is to set up the slave device on the web admin of that device so I can go ahead and do that for the second balance 20x the steps are the same except for the preferred role setting make sure to select slave there are actually two options for slave configuration in Nat mode the two options are configuration sync and manual when configuration sync is enabled the slave unit will obtain and apply the configuration changes from the master unit every 5 minutes alternatively you may also configure the slave unit manually for configuration sync the first step is to click and choose slave as the preferred role then choose the box to enable the configuration SYNC feature once you've done that you can enter the serial number of the master unit before applying these changes it is required to change the Lan IP address and set it to a different one from the master unit to do this go to network then under Lan settings change the Lan IP address once you've done that you can go ahead and click save and apply changes to activate the settings once the configuration sync succeeds you will find the successful message in the event log of the slave unit once the slave unit is configured to automatically sync configuration from the master unit the web admin of the slave unit will be locked changes can only be made after you've disabled the configuration sync function for the manual method the first step is to go to the systems tab for the master device web admin page then click download under the download active configuration section then you have to save the configuration file for the slave unit to do this you need to go to the system tab of your saved device then go to the configuration section and choose the configuration file exported from the master device make sure you upload it under the upload configurations from high availability pair and click upload before applying these changes it is required to change the line IP address and set it up as a different one from the master unit to do this go to network and then go to Lan here you can change the Lan IP address then since we uploaded the configuration from the master device the configuration on your slave device will be set as master so to change this go to network and under the high availability section you can change the preferred role of slave balance from Master to slave finally you can click save and then apply changes to activate these settings the failover takes place with a typical recovery time of 10 to 15 seconds after the slave unit changed its stroll to master all line connections will be re-established again to ensure that the AHA mode has been successfully enabled you can head to the web admin page of your slave device then on the dashboard you will be able to see the AHA mode has been enabled"}

to be the router UI um see what the next slide is here because it might have it uh the router UI nope okay it's just in control okay so we have like the router UI in control an old tool that Travis and I were laughing about the router utility before in control is even out and then we have but then we have like the sfc app and we have um the uh the in control app and we have the sfc cloud and we have the pool manager and and so we wanted to like introduce these tools as a single webinar so anybody new to the ecosystem or anybody that's just going how do I manage all of my devices uh you know how do how does how do we do it how does Professor P do it how do msps manage thousands of users or customers all over the world um and uh and this is how we do it and so kind of getting a little back-end access here but also something that is close to home for uh Travis and I because it's something we've seen develop from the in control one uh with the pathway Keys all the way to you know an entire sd-wan ecosystem and so uh thank you for joining me and I'm really excited to have this webinar today you're muted yeah I think this is a fun one because there's just so many different uh perspectives out there in terms of people using peplink like you said there's there's individual rvers that have a single router and they are in their RV using it and we have you know the biggest companies in the world who have thousands and thousands of peplink routers and so the way that each of those different people uses our products is different for sure and we've got different tools for those different people and it's a little bit hard to kind of process all the different things out there when you look at it all at once but again it's different tools for different people and you know kind of how you're looking to to use our devices so yeah let's dive in yeah so in control two is obviously the core part of our stuff and it's that control two is what a lot of our other tools use to connect and so in control two is our centralized management platform for for vlans and outbound policies and firewalls and all of our devices our APS our switches um and it's like an extension of our peplink web admin our local web GUI but then it brings it allows us to manage a bunch of devices and push configurations and that and I think it's really important about peplink we are pushing a configuration to a local device so if the in-control cloud goes down your device maintains that configuration and so that means we're going to have increased reliability increased Cloud stability um and and really allowing for different security models there are some companies that say hey we can't have stuff connecting to the cloud but we want your sd-wan that's not a problem for us we have the tools to manage those routers we also have the GUI the web GUI to be able to play with those routers and configure them as if um and not not as convenient as in control but being able to do that all in one place and so in control two really just ties everything together and becomes a centralized reporting and management and pushing configurations uh capability now there are some things in in control that are um Cloud dependent um actually I'll say is we have some databases so we have some SAS applications that the big databases of like Microsoft and Google and things like that so if you want to do SAS based policies or firewalls um you need to have you need to be connected to in control and then we have Regional capabilities you can say you know allow and this is a us-based uh webinar so I'm not insulting any any country here but you say allow us but block other countries or if you're in Europe allow Europe and block other countries Etc um and and so the um but the idea is there's Regional databases and those SAS databases those are managed inside in control the other thing that in control brings that is cloud dependent is our content filtering database so if you're using our content filtering on the routers to get those updates on on whenever they're pushed down you have to be connected to end controllers um on in control to receive those updates otherwise you'll get whatever database is just stored on the router when it ships and all I'm saying all this right right Travis I mean so far okay um and so so there are things that need in control um for enhanced capabilities but the core functionality of every router can actually be Cloud independent and so that's the whole purpose of this webinar is to show you these tools and capabilities we have to help help users manage the routers and program them an example like with simplified management is you know using in control two and speed Fusion we can we can basically create a zero touch configuration on the the VPN or the speed Fusion connectivity um which allows us to manage a lot of sites from a single pane of glass it's really clean and easy but but you could have in control two you have the web admin that you can log into those devices and then we have speed Fusion connect for outbound policies and bonding So Last Mile a lot of people call that like Last Mile connectivity right if you're connecting up to your headquarters you have dual fiber lines and you want resiliency on those dual fiber lines you can use speed Fusion connect to make your voice and video applications um is really reliable I even redundant across those that you know those highly reliable connections then we have peplink ID so peplink uses peplink ID to basically to unify connectivity or unify access to all of its different tools and so one of the things that I actually didn't know until this webinar I've seen it but I've just never really paid attention to it was peplinkid.peplink.com and peplink idea if you go to peplinkid.peplink.com and then you log in with your username and password it takes you to this this page and this page is really cool because it it gives you you can just go to the partner Pavilion if you're a Microsoft if you're a peplink partner or you can go to the training if you want to enhance your training you can log into the forum or the ticket system then you can access in control or speedfusion.com speedfusion connect or what we call sfc.peplink.com or even the e-store for licenses and renewals and things like that um and and so all of these things are tied together including the in control app and the sfc app that I'll show you shortly are all tied into your peplink ID and so I am going to give you a little bit of uh tips and tricks on that as well with the peplink ID for securing that account and you can see here that you could click on these and launch these apps or different web web portals um and access these systems and it's all integrated into this single platform then we have the in control app the in control app pulls some of the functionality of in control to your device really what's really powerful about this is notifications um if you have the if you enable notifications in in control and then you have the in control app those notifications come right into your phone and then you can click right on a device and pull up those statistics almost instantaneously um and it's very powerful um for for using the in control app for configuration is not as powerful as in control and I'll show that um but for notifications status reporting that is where where I live in that uh being able to to see oh um Wan failed at the site let me click on that real fast in seconds you're just clicking you're pulling up the device you're looking at that way and health those Wan Health settings um and so the in control app takes in control and all of its configuration capabilities and brings reporting and status and notifications right to your phone I it does have some configuration capabilities but we're going to keep it to reporting and status for the purpose of my training um I find that to be what it's really good at yeah a lot of people would just love the uh remote web admin yeah yeah and so remote way on which I'll show off is is exactly you click it you can see it and you go boom remote web and you're right into it yeah then we have the sfc app and this when it first launched I was really confused by and then I saw how how neat it is for the consumer and I really do see it that way um this is say you are an rver or a work from Homer or um you're just a small business or just have one or two routers that you just want to be able to have and you don't want to deal with all those configuration capabilities and in control in the complex web UI the sfc app basically creates a zero touch sd-wan configuration capability instead of creating speed Fusion tunnels between your locations you're creating you're connecting to speed Fusion connect protect you're bonding your cellular or your cable modem with your cellular and you can create the different types of connections like you know bonding jitter-free connectivity like Wan smoothing and and then you know um just making as fast as possible and so you have like um you it's really simple intuitive and easy to configure but I wouldn't recommend it for anybody using speed Fusion or with uh an Enterprise or business where they want to fine-tune firewall policies and outbound policies and things like that this is really designed for your rver your SMB that has one or two sites and they're just trying to simplify the management and using speed Fusion connect with potentially the speed Fusion connect LTE service uh Slash 5G service because you can re-up that and see that right from the speed Fusion Connect app and I think we did a webinar on speed Fusion connect didn't we we did yep yeah so so if you want to learn more about this particular app you should definitely check out the um the sfc app um uh video where we actually I actually loaded up 10 gigabytes we set up the five the the my balance 20x I go this is my my sfc balance 20x um and I kind of keep that on there so I can play around with it um I loaded that up with some sfc LTE data and you know brought it online set up a Wi-Fi um and so it's just nice because you log in and you can see here I've got one wired Wan one cellular Wan I've got one wired land device right now connected to that device I've got two Wi-Fi devices I've got 100 gigs of sfc bonding I've got 10 gigs of 5G LTE you know and so you can pull this up you can update the router firmware just by clicking that upgrade available right there if you have more than one router you can actually go go to the little menu bar go to routers and then actually choose those routers so it's really easy to select but can you imagine having like 30 or 40 routers this would be really complicated that's what you want to kind of want to switch back to in control but but a few routers it's very nice you can see quickly your sfc protect and your SS sfc LTE 5G data um and then you can go into your speed Fusion settings and easily app say hey my zoom calls I want to be bonded or I want to be Jitter free and so you can do those outbound policies which we have another YouTube video on outbound policies and you can use the this intuitive GUI to basically create outbound policies um and it just simplifies that and then you can actually purchase plans right from the app so you can re-up your sfc protect and your fi you're at 5G slash LTE right within the app it launches up the sfcc store and you can just simply purchase um more data and then you have a simplified report viewer that then allows you to monitor your data and usage and and so I find for anybody that's really kind of in the RV Market the only thing that I think that this needs which I believe is coming is Wi-Fi Wan a lot of people in the RV World they need Wi-Fi when and unfortunately when you add a router to this right now you lose the ability to Wi-Fi Wan um and so I believe it's already been reported and it's coming soon um but that would be if you are an rver and you're heavy into the Wi-Fi Wan do not use this app yet because that is not currently available you'd want to stick with the router utility or the in control or just the web UI the router utility this is pre in control um I I used this for years before end control came out um and it was my my only means of connecting and it was so hard because I'd have you know four or five hundred devices and you have to VPN into the devices and log them up or you have to have them all going back to like a fusion or like a centralized router and then you can connect to those IPS so if you have a corporate Network and you're connecting like a hub and spoke environment you can VPN into the main router and then you boom you get the status of all of um those those routers that you have but the the um or you can connect into the WAN um so by putting the public IP address username and password and then access all those routers um but the router utility is non and unCloud connected you're literally logging right into that router via an IP address username and password um there's no Cloud broker um so you have to be able to reach that router whether that's connecting to a VPN and using a lan ipg just or enabling the WAN IP address access on this router um on the routers that you want to connect to yeah definitely an old tool but you know for certain use cases I could see maybe maybe using this still yeah right I mean it was fun for me because I haven't used it since end control too really um and I used to have hundreds of routers in my in my router utility and and I'd have it by customers so I'd have all my you know customer One customer two customer I'd use l2tb VPN on on my my phone and then I would Connect into that customer's Hub router and that would bring up all their routers so I could quickly see all the routers that they had I know some people connect right into the the WAN interface but there's some security uh concerns you know having the WAN UI just open um but but I've seen other people that just simply have all the way all of them connected to be a win and you can see the status right there from the internet as well and now I'm going to show these off um so kind of quick overview this is a really simple um uh webinar actually the so first off I'm going to show off peplink ID so if you just go to peplicid.peplink.com you sign in you can literally click on any of these items that you have authorization or you know if you're not a partner that's obviously well I guess I would launch your customer portal but like I can click on this and it's going to load up in control um or I can go to this calm and um and then sign right in and so it gives you all the access that you need and you're signed in you don't have to worry about it um and so it's really a nice place just to if you don't know what you're looking for you can go right into peplinkid.peplink.com so um the next thing is the web UI and I'm going to kind of cheat I'm going to use in control to show off the web UI um just because my my corporate router and I don't want to I'm going to use my peplink University router so we're going to do a pretend here let's just pretend I'm typing in 192.168.50.1 in the top uh address bar so if you're locally connected or on a VPN or connected to your device in the address bar you just go into 192.168.50.1 or whatever the IP address is of the router you're connecting to and then you can log into the web UI the web UI as you just saw can also be accessed via in control which is very very nice but this is actually something I really I for in control before the router utility app before this is what made me fall in love with peplink it really is I I mean before they had bonding before speed Fusion existed the ability to just log into this UI and at least for my intuition this this design made the most sense of any route I've ever logged into and to this day I believe it still does on the dashboard it gives you your status I can see what my connections are I have my interface uh priorities so you can see I've got my highest priority my priority two my priority three and then disabled if I drag something down into property three then priority 4 will become an option as well I've got my my La my land my router interface IP I've got my Wi-Fi I can turn it on or off and go to a status I have my speed Fusion connect protect and the status how many terabytes I have free when it expires and then I have my overall system status at what firmware I'm running how many days it's been online CPU load uh temperature power a b and terminal block what my throughput is like from a troubleshooting and tech support scenario that gives me almost everything I need to be able to see the next is just what the performance of those guys are um and then you move over a tab I've got my sfc protect I can quickly and easily configure my bonding and then route by application create an SSID or a lan client and then I go to my network and I have my Wan and My Lan configuration that's my network and so I can configure my vlans and my um my DHCP options um outbound static routes not outbound policies uh I configure my ports for my vlans ACCESS ports and trunk ports I configure my wands I can enable if I go to WAN down here I can scroll down I can enable IPv6 on a Wan I can enable DNS over https or Wan quality monitoring Synergy controller starlink so if I have a starlink plugged into uh wan1 I can click this choose when one hit save and it's going to monitor win one for starlink that by the way is beta 4. so if you don't if you have running 8.3 you won't see that um but it's just to me it's like I have my dashboard I have my network and then I have my Advanced features and advanced features I've got my my connections so I've got my speed Fusion ipsec GRE open VPN and then my outbound policies are traffic shaping and then I have my port forwarding then you have Nat you have your Edge compute you have your quality of service your firewall your routing protocols VPN options and then miscellaneous settings and so you just work your way from the network tab to the advanced Tab and work top to bottom and program it and it's like to me that makes sense and I've always appreciated that about peplink um how simple that is and by the way I've got one hour to do a whole bunch of tutorials so I'm literally shoving this down your throat um I have an entire one hour video just on in control two but what I'm trying to do is Showcase the utilization capabilities of these different apps as quickly as possible I'm giving myself just a few minutes per app I hope that's okay uh Travis absolutely yeah um and so so and that I mean then you have your AP controller so if you have a whole bunch of access points or you want to set up your ssids we have an AP controller built in and then under system settings you can configure like did you want to allow it to report to in control your SMS controls which by the way is really cool um SNMP event log email notification specific times and we have these tools and it's funny um these tools seem so simple but I had a customer that was blaming about latency to a fusion Hub and they're like oh this you know the peplink is not functioning right well I went to the trace route did a trace route between the the peplinks WAN interface and the fusion Hub the first Hop was 90 like 70 milliseconds of latency I said well that should be like Point 0.5 milliseconds that that means there's a fiber cable or an ethernet cable going from your wan to the Gateway to your ISP and if that's taking 70 milliseconds there's a problem um and so trace route shows you where the performance is along your your internet path from one destination to the other and it's such a simple tool but it's incredibly valuable especially when you're talking about multiple internet connections um and then Wan analysis if you've never seen this tool I've got a YouTube video on it incredibly powerful tool for monitoring the performance of all your lands um all built right into this web that is not required for any Cloud connectivity you don't have to have in control you don't have to have yeah literally just log right in and you can access these tools speaking of that click on the in control but tab there on the left I will just I like to show this because to your point you can set this up for absolutely zero Cloud connectivity yeah so you can some people are very sensitive on that and there's good reasons for that and you can disable all of that just right there yeah so you go to in control you can disable you can also restrict to status reporting only status reporting only if you if I had click applied changes I will no longer have remote web access literally it just reports the health of the device to in control and that's it you have no other access no configurations it can't push firewall policies or content or um outbound policies or speed Fusion profiles or anything um and then you also if you have a private ic2 or you can actually click that and then put in the AIP address or host name of your private iec2 as well so um once again real quick not not a web UI training more of a uh just an overview of that that capability um next I wanted to show off the let me next I wanted to show off speed in control so we have the web UI to manage multiple devices or centralize the management of multiple devices and so we have our dashboard um so you can see the status is this device is online here's my name my any tags Associated how Wi-Fi is configured it's configured at the group level which means Wi-Fi is being provisioned here at the wi-fi at the group level the product how long it's been online what my internet connections are so you can see I have two Cellular Connections and two ethernet connections so I've got two ethernet devices connected and then two cellular devices connected my firmware which has become really important lately my Wi-Fi channels my usage number of clients my firmware for the actual router and then the last time a configuration was applied but you can also customize that so if you go to column customization right here you can actually select a bunch of different things so if you're using speed Fusion connect I can select that hit OK and now I can see the status of my speed Fusion connect which we'll we'll propagate here in a minute uh there it goes and so you can see my sfc so so if you you can customize these columns to fit your needs then if you click on the device I now get a better view of this device and it's very similar to that other dashboard I can see I'm pulling two Poes these are actually my vlans that are powering my my br1 Minis that are my two ethernet wands um and you can see right there VLAN is wan one and VLAN is wan two um you can see my speed Fusion connect established what routes I know about my in control detected IP address CPU load temperature just like you would get in that router dashboard um but if I go back to the speed Fusion Rebel and I'm at the group level I can configure my speed Fusion settings I can configure my web my Wi-Fi SSID settings my radio settings my output power I can configure outbound policies traffic shaping and I can like I said use that Regional in that SAS space I can say Zoom use sfc protect when smoothing but my my um my video broadcast use sfc Ford error correction um and so you can use outbound policies to shape that traffic you can create firewall rules and you can create firewall Rules by SAS applications by region or by standard source and destination and protocols we can create grouped networks which is groups of IP addresses um that allow you to sim IP management so you can create a group of servers and say and then on access control list which is a group of Mac addresses you can say here's an authorized PCS you can say these authorized PCS can talk to these servers and it becomes centrally managed so you could have 400 sites with a group of 300 servers and 8 000 uh laptops and then basically it doesn't matter which site they're at the access control list database is being centrally managed and it's not going to allow access um you can then manage your vlans your routes your Lan network settings route advertisement ospf and BG or ospf not really bgp on this on the route advertisement but ospf and rip um you can set up your captive portals and then you can create connection test reports this is how you can actually tell hey every morning at 7am speed test my network and then tell me if it's less than 10 megabits or if you have you know a gig circuit tell me if it's less than 800 megabits per second or whatever it might be and then you get a report that shows you the pass and fails of your network all from within in control too you can manage this you can then centrally see all your clients you can click on this and see all the clients and then you can go and go into our reporting which is incredible so we have like device reports Wi-Fi reports usage reports SIM card reports which is awesome um captive portal dashboard reports captive portal reports connection test reports so those reports the the connection tests run you can view the connection test reports there centralized event log across to all of your devices and then you can see all your tags and and where those tags are being deployed and then you have your settings the settings is overall capability so you can see I've got my device management so which devices are there and um add and remove those devices to add devices device IP settings literally IP address management for all of your lands and your vlans complicated super powerful I did a project where you deployed like first and I just created an Excel spreadsheet with all the serial numbers the subnets and then putting all the settings and put it there literally brought the routers online boom they all got programmed in a matter of seconds it was really cool system management allows you to configure the device password randomly generate passwords for device so it makes it allows you to push PCI DSS compliance change the username disable the the guest user account set up the portal the web at the the port and protocol the vlans that can access the device so it's about how the device can be accessed and what the device is able to do um certificate management is what it is captive certificate control options allows you to lower down how much bandwidth is being consumed notifications allows you to send notifications so you can make multiple notification tabs so you can say hey I want notifications going to my it team on a router up and down but I want a notification go to my finance team if I consume too much bandwidth so if my if I get 90 of my um my bandwidth uh use for My ATT it's going to email the finance team and make sure they they update your check that account report emailing allows you to send reports daily monthly and weekly about the health of your network firmware policy allows you to centrally manage firmware so you can push out and update all your routers at one time device schedule which we showed you on the device on the web UI allows you to actually set a schedule and turn on and off features or assign tags so I literally like my my I it's kind of a funny joke that goes around if you've been around me enough we own an ice cream store and so the ice cream store is open from noon to not to nine or ten and the Wi-Fi is on from noon to nine or ten whatever day it is and then outside of the schedule the guest Wi-Fi shuts down so people can't walk up and just try to get into my my Wi-Fi network at night uh geofencing allows us to do geofencing and tagging and turn on and off Wi-Fi so another good example that we've always used is that we have our speed Fusion fleet vehicles when they're in the parking lot they get tagged as in off uh and and office and then the Wi-Fi gets shut off that way they're not broadcasting Wi-Fi and my employees don't accidentally use the starlink or the cellular network they're using our our Wi-Fi network in our office and then bulk configure allows you to configure the push one configuration to a bunch of devices so if you have like a br1 mini or br1 Pro 5G and you want to deploy it to a thousand you want the same config to a thousand devices configure one device save the configuration file upload it to Vault configurator and say assign it to bulk tag or whatever tag you want to assign and literally you can import a thousand devices assign them to bulk configuration tag whatever tag you assign to that and then when those devices come online they will get that config if someone makes a change it'll revert back to that config so it allows you to ensure compliance of your devices and then add delivery service that is only based on subscription it won't show up everybody won't have that ad delivery services peplink's uh really cool capability to add ads to captive portals and Wi-Fi the uh Speech and then group settings just as like usernames passwords who's allowed to access the group um and things like that but all of that centrally manages all of your devices at one time and and so you can have um I like peplink University is my org and then inside the org I have all my my groups and these are different projects that we're working on or training scenarios we're working on within peplink University so we have like my speed Fusion Patriot Rebel and Renegade um those are our three RVs you know we have like you know um br2 case I'm testing some new br1s um PDX epx case you know so anytime I'm testing stuff I throw into peplink University make a video about it and so that's the the organization level we have organization reports organization settings organization centrally managed speed Fusion across groups and then you can go into that group like the rebel and then you have your those settings and then you go into the device and then you have device level settings so you can have device level Reports device level speed Fusion device level Wi-Fi clients and then the settings and that lets you remote web admin so if you go into the device hd4mbx5g settings remote web admin then you can log into that device remotely so um so that's in control in a 10 minute nutshell like I said I have a uh a full hour training on my YouTube peplink University YouTube channel and you can um play It's My peplink University playlist under West networks and then you can um watch the full one hour training but I want to be able to get through all of this today um next I have um the speed Fusion sfc.peplink.com lets you manage speed Fusion connect related stuff so this is sfc protect and sfc LTE so I can see here here's my that hd4 mbx 5G that's peplink University and the rebel I have 2.5 terabytes of sfc protect I have zero sfc 5G LTE so if I wanted to I could select on that and I could actually buy or assign data by a pool um and and assign it to this device and so what's really cool to kind of talk about pool data for a second Travis it's sort of a little offset but yeah go for it so what's really cool now is peplink now has pooled sfc LTE data and so you can buy a one terabyte pool and it is only assigned I believe to an organization right that gets pushed to an org and then from that org you can actually assign data to devices so now you can you can buy one terabyte of sfc data if you have 150 250 whatever devices or or one and my and well I've got more than one in my my org but you can assign data to that group and so that's under sf's 5G pool management and you can see here's my pep link I don't have any pool data I did try to buy some uh for this training um but I don't know if I have to refresh it or not but um I did try and then you could basically add devices to a pool so under um Pool Management you once you have your pool once you subscribe this would say I've got you know one terabyte or whatever I bought available and then I could add my speed Fusion Rebel and then it would then have um that data and you have your auto top up so it's basically it's going to add 500 megabyte increments and it's going to top up once you hit below 100 megabytes and that way you're not it's basically assigning data to each of these SIM cards or each of these devices without consuming no you don't have to buy hey I'm gonna buy a 10 terabyte plan for this router and a five terabyte plan for this router and a one terabyte plan for this router it's I can just buy the data on the on for the organization and then have it automatically top up those routers that might configure amount and if jobs I don't know if you want to talk more to this but yeah the big difference I think you just said it there is you're not paying per month for each SIM card for each router right you're pooling the actual usage across however many you have and you just buy that one bucket of data and everybody gets to use off of that so it's it's a different format right it's a different model altogether than what people are used to for buying data you know either used to paying per month per Sim and then on top of that having some sort of either pooled or per sem limit and so yeah I I am refreshing to see if it loaded as I pause my screen sharing just for a section so it has not loaded yet um so anyways I did try to buy it for this uh this but just hasn't hasn't pulled in yet but um okay um and so yeah so anyways but you just you just click the little ad here and you can buy data and then and it'll process through the backend system and then it'll show up um but it's really really nice because you no longer have to buy data per device you can buy data for your entire organ just to Auto auto set it up um so we also have our mobile apps and I downloaded this uh cast program so hopefully this works today so I've got my uh my little phone here um so the first app so we've got three apps that we can we have um on the phone we have your your in control app your router utility and the speed Fusion Connect app so if I look at the router utility I've added my my router this is actually my router to my my Wi-Fi network because once again you have to be connected or accessible um so I have my sdx I can click on the sdx I can see um I've got my Cox Cable in standby I've got some speed Fusion profiles My Lan interface um I can pull up and I can see if I have speed Fusion connect I can it looks like I can set up speed speed Fusion connect I could say automatic and hit save um system information event log so I can see my event log and see what's happening there I can pull up a client list and see all the devices that are connected and then I've got this settings and I can enable um this router will will not send notifications so the default is to send notifications but if you don't want it to send you can turn that on um and so it's a pretty simple tool but it gives you access to um easily manage your routers if you're if you're if you don't want to use in control um then we have the in control app so if I pull this up here once again here's my speed Fusion rebel I can go back to the peplink university and I can see all my different groups that I showed you there um and so there's my speed Fusion Rebel so I can click on that there's my hd4 mbx 5G but I have my event log so I can see what's going on there I have my clients and I can see the clients connected to the rebel it's probably just the Samsung TV but um and then um I can see it online offline I can click on the um hd4mbx5g I can see that there I can swipe over and go to my network and there's my connection so there's my VLAN as Wan my cellular 3 Cellular One um I can show disabled connections and see all of all the interfaces right there so there's uh USP USB one and two there's my vlans my Wi-Fi wins my Wan one and Wan two um there's My Lan interface and so what you're seeing is really good reporting right I can I can quickly see the status but one of the most powerful capabilities here if I remember how to do this do you remember how to do this how do I oh tools so if I go to tools I can reboot the device I can turn off my wireless LAN I can turn on off remote Assistance or I can launch remote web admin and that's going to bring up the remote web admin inside this app so I can quickly log into this device via the app and do Advanced troubleshooting so the app gives me status and then I now have in control two right or I mean the router web UI right inside the router utility so I'm not I'm not 100 like additional authentication I don't have to worry about extra access I don't have to worry about remembering a whole bunch of passwords on my um my my browser it's all right here and I can pull up this router and I can see everything that with a web UI has I now have that full control from the the end control app did I miss anything on that um Travis Scott okay I just want to make sure um got that covered but I I love this app it runs on I mean I've got my my production phone I've got my lab phone that I'm using for this video um I've run the in control app I love the notifications that it provides and that quick status I don't have to wait for the web UI to load if I'm if I'm out in the world I can simply just see what's going on with my devices um and it really allows me to provide really great tech support as well as just peace of mind that my Network's running um and then we have the sfc app and we talked about that a little bit um uh earlier I've got you know basically and the the screenshots pretty much gave you everything so I'll quickly just because I've got it up and I like this this screencast feature but um you got the you got the I got my 20x um you can see I'm running the latest firmware um right now the router is offline but I've got my wans my lands my Wi-Fi I can see that I've got 1.1 terabytes of sfc protect available I've got 9.4 gigabytes of 5G available but it's expiring soon so it's saying hey view plans go ahead and update that if you want and that's I wanted that's why I wanted to show this is because you know if it it's not always easy to know when you have these you know Soho devices especially if you're doing a big work from home initiative you know you can manage that beta right there um I can choose my cloud location right now I just do auto so it's Auto connecting to Dallas um I can choose my apps and then program how they're being protected so you can see Dropbox is going to to Dallas because it's Auto um exchange goes to Auto FaceTime is not so I can choose FaceTime and say configure Cloud location Auto hey save and now FaceTime will be protected by speed Fusion protect I can choose Google meet by the way these are new they've been added recently and I can say Auto and hit save and so you see how easy it is to program an outbound policy based on a SAS application I just did FaceTime and Google meet in a matter of like nine seconds and I didn't need any programming I didn't need any web UI I didn't need to know how to do outbound policies or how to log in I simply just went to the speed Fusion Tab and selected the apps and and what's really cool is as peplink adds more apps they just show up here and you can protect those apps and I find that to be a really cool cool feature I really do um and then it even tells you speed Fusion protection is ineffective two-wan connections are required so it's saying hey you only have one cellular modem connected to this thing um that you're really kind of not doing anything right you need to plug in another cell modem or you need to um uh plug in Ethernet or Wi-Fi Wan or something like that um and if you click on digital devices you can actually pull up the the devices and then I can protect your laptop so I can say hey I want my laptop to use speed Fusion connect because a lot of times especially with speakers you connect you might it might block Netflix or Hulu and things like that so you can just select your laptops have it protected but your smart TV or your Amazon Fire or whatever it might be just let it do load balancing that way you don't get blocked by you know that you're on a VPN um and then you have your reporting capability so you can pull up your reports and it's going to give your Wan quality reports and your data usage reports and then you can pull up your users and this is kind of neat this is user saw like here's me I could hit invite user type in Travis peplink.com and then Travis then has sfc app and then he can log in and so I can share this with other people and I find that to be a you know so it's just a really nice Soho consumer version of like almost like a lightweight version of in control in a sense yep yep and that's I think I think you hit it right on the head we're trying to give an end user a powerful centralized you know simple management tool that doesn't go into all the weave but lets them do the big things quick and easy so um that that's where it's at right now and there's gonna be a lot more effort put into that app and I think you'll start to see more merging of the tools too or or um maybe not merging but um more compatibility between them so if you've got like Amanda service provider that has a thousand customers they can start enabling more control for their end users to have the ability to prioritize these apps or change their Wi-Fi network right start to let them use in control to manage the big settings but let the user control the little side exactly more and more you'll start to see us move in that direction I believe with with this app but again really focusing on that end user experience being simple easy to understand and you know powerful for that that audience being the goal and it is really easy to add a new device so if you go to select router click the plus and then you can put in the serial number it's like right there and then if you click the supported models these are the currently supported models and so that's also important to understand is that so it you know and once again this app is being updated we're adding more you have more support models are coming soon um but right now it's your br1 mini Hardware three the br1 pro 5G the way the br1 pro LTE um 20x the br2 pro 5G um Transit Duo Pro and ubr plus and so um those are the only apps a router supported by this sfc app right now um but if you if you ever need to if you ever want to see if your router model has been added you can just check there and see if it's been added um I think that covers all the tools right Travis router utility web UI and control app sfc app in control sfc.pep link peplink ID and pool management so I think I think we've got there are some other things that that are outside the scope of this conversation like you know but uh but but that that's pretty much um the tools um see if we have any questions here well um question from someone said well private hosted in control get these database updates yes um if you're running a private version of in control um you can download the updates and you get the features as well um it's just a little bit behind the production updates but you can you can reach out to your partner and get that and see so even if it draws up automatically oh I don't know uh that's a question for Travis Travis um uh Jacob asked uh if we're using the pool management is there a way to set a cap so a particular router can only pull so much I think you would probably set that in that router like the you know the Sim oh yeah you could set the Sim cap yeah um where it shuts off after 100 gigs that that's my knee-jerk answer on that one yeah we'll have to research that one Jacob that's a good question um yeah I and once I get this once I get my my pool activated here on peplink University that I bought I'll I'll actually check that and play with it maybe I'll release a maybe maybe Travis and I can do just do an off-grid pool manager video that's a good idea just a training video on pool management and we'll get we'll actually pay for it activate it and play with those features um SSC apps in the app also available through in control outbound pause so um uh Richard asked the question I don't actually try to figure out are the sfc apps in the app also available through in control outbound policy so I'm in control if I go to my speed Fusion Rebel and I go to outbound policy and I can create a rule add a rule and I could say if my destination is SAS and then I'm going to get all those same same apps right there yep um and so they're like Google Zoom z-scaler actually that's actually not listed on the other one exchange and so you can choose your apps like zoom and Google and uh WebEx and then I can say connection uh priority speed Fusion sfc and then now basically if if the source is any the destination is zoom Google or WebEx go out the sfc as a priority and then actually say hey if that's not existent what do you want to do drop it or just fail to the next Rule and then if the sfc app sfc VPN is established go ahead and move that traffic back over or don't um so that's how you would do this and that's how you would do that same thing that's available in the sfc app on individual and yeah basically those are the same lists there might be one or two here or there as this or that's updated you know out of sync but yeah for the most part that is the same list yeah they should be um approximately the same Richard um that sometimes like your weight you have to wait because we can't just update um sometimes they have to push an update um so they might be queried for the next update cycle um but but pretty much it's it's going to be the same list or very close to it because I don't I don't see uh one of the things that I didn't see or I saw in the app I don't see FaceTime here so that's I guess that's where yeah I don't see FaceTime here so I'm assuming in the next iteration of but you could also uh and we show this off almost every single time click the feedback app feedback button and literally you can say if it's gonna show up Maybe it's supposed to pop up with with the tool I can say we picked the glitch Let me refresh feedback let's try oh okay well that I am in Venus on peplink University so I'm going to toss that up to Venus right there um but yeah if you click the feedback app and say please add FaceTime um I'm sure they'll add it for you and if you have other apps you can use that feedback button click the feedback button and say hey can you add whatever app and that helps the community as a whole um any other questions if if not we'll uh we'll call this uh uh a good good webinar I think a good webinar if you have any comments or questions um you can also have to Peter westnetworks.com or Travis peplink.com um if you have any suggestions for for a for a webinar that you'd like to learn more about um once again please reach out to Peter westnetworks.com or Travis peplink.com and we'd be more than happy to to add it to the queue we're always looking for good topics and we tried this the first Tuesday or the second Tuesday of every month is our goal um and so Travis what's up man thanks so much Peter as always so well thank you everybody for joining sorry for missing last week I I really appreciate everybody for for joining today and this well we'll put publish this online here shortly so thank you all right thanks folks take care foreign"}

"in this video I will demonstrate how to complete the sales registration for your device how to check the status of the warranty of your peplink device and finally how to renew your warranty it is essential for customers to complete the sales registration process to maintain an accurate warranty status of their device if it isn't completed properly or on time this can lead to inaccurate warranty termination dates devastating issues can arise from improper or late sales registrations such as termination of Hardware warranty and restricted access to special features therefore this process is absolutely crucial it is also important for users to learn how to extend the warranty of their devices this can come in handy for renewing the warranty if it is close to expiring it is also useful if a device were to malfunction at which point the user can notify us to receive a new device also extending the warranty can ensure that the device still has access to certain features allowing you to unlock your device's full potential and to supercharge your network the first step for successfully completing the sales registration is to find the serial number of your device this can be found on the bottom of your physical device on the main dashboard event control 2 is shown over here and finally even on web admin in the device section under the status tab once the serial number has been obtained you can head to the sales registration page to get here you first need to head to the support page on the peplink official site then click on login under the customer portal and product registration page here you need to input all the necessary information such as the serial number the date of purchase the point of purchase your name phone number and finally your address once you've submitted all the relevant information you will have completed the sales registration now I'll show you how to check the status of your warranty device there are actually a lot of different ways to check and confirm the status of your warranty to see whether it is still active or has expired the first method is to check in control 2. to find your warranty expiry date on in control 2 you first need to head to the main dashboard here you need to select the device you're inquiring about this should take you to the dashboard page for that specific device if you click on show all then you'll be able to see all the relevant information including the warranty expiry date near the bottom of the list depending on the subscription packages and care plans that you opted for your dashboard could say the following warranty expiry date Prime Care expiry date or essential care expired date if you're unable to find the warranty information you can also submit an inquiry to the peptic support team via the online ticketing system if you're unsure how to submit a ticket please watch the demo video for that the link will be embedded below to make things more convenient for you we will also send you an email to notify you when your warranty is close to expiring this should provide you with sufficient time to extend your warranty it is best to keep in mind that purchasing an extended warranty is only possible for users that still have an active warranty renewing or extending the warranty of your device is another crucial process that users need to be aware of peplink provides a one-year standard warranty at no additional charge this warranty period can be extended if desired the extended warranty covers hardware issues and gives users access to firmware upgrades and in control too this is because only in warranty devices have access to in control extended warranty packages can be purchased for specific devices on the e-store subscription packages include essential care essential Care Plus Prime Care and Prime Care Plus each care plan except for the essential care has a one two and four year subscription option essential Care on the other hand has a one and two year subscription package available I will first briefly explain the difference between each care package before demonstrating the steps for renewing or purchasing the subscription the basic package is the essential care package this package comes with a standard RMA for defective pieces the essential care package also includes consistent firmware upgrades access to sfc protect and in touch and technical support during work hours this package isn't available for PrimeCare models antennas and other accessories there is also an upgraded package called essential Care Plus this is for devices that are eligible for the essential care package but provides additional benefits the First Advantage for purchasing the essential Care Plus Package is that it comes with the Advanced Hardware replacement RMA this means that if a user has a defective piece of Hardware then the user will be provided with a replacement unit prior to us receiving the defective unit in doing so users can drastically minimize their connectivity downtime the second key difference between the Plus Package compared to the standard package is that you will receive 24 7 technical support another package is the prime care package this package includes all the features from the essential care package and more therefore this is a top tier package exclusively for PrimeCare models the one key difference is that for PrimeCare you will have access to speed Fusion bonding Fusion Hub piers and other Prime Care features whereas for essential care these features are licensed separately finally there's also an upgraded PrimeCare package called PrimeCare plus this package includes all the features from the essential Care Plus Package the PrimeCare package and more except for the fact that it is exclusively for PrimeCare models to check which package is suitable for your device you can click on buy at the top of the peplink site then click on the Amazon store once you've reached the site you can scroll down to find your device after clicking on the device you'll be able to see the software that is available for your device you can even enter your serial number at the bottom in doing so the website will direct you to the e-store and provide you with a list of subscription plans and software licenses that are available for your device another method to renew or purchase a specific care plan would be to visit the peplink e-store the link can be found on the peplink official website to visit the store click on buy at the top then click on the pep Link store once you've opened up the e-store click on the search bar and search the serial number for your device this will allow you to view the compatible care plans and feature pack options now you can select the care plan which is suitable for you and click add to cart the final step would be to click on the card icon on the right and click check out there is also an auto renewal option for your subscription this can be set up by taking the auto renewal box before checking out but to be eligible for this option customers need to pay with a credit card that being said we recommend that customers use the auto renewal function on in control 2 instead as the generated renewal would be automatically activated by in control 2."}

get started let me briefly explain the network topology first you need two devices that are capable of using speed fusion with a public IP on at least one wand connection if it isn't a static public IP you must register it with a supported ddns service allowing you to create speed Fusion to the WAN ddns host name now let me briefly explain how our speed Fusion technology works so that you can fully understand how the speed Fusion VPN works speed Fusion is a bonded VPN technology that allows you to aggregate multiple internet connections together to create session persistent and reliable VPN connections between endpoints our unique speed Fusion technology is the combination of the most advanced Network Technologies currently available our speed Fusion technology can enhance all aspects of your network connectivity for both your personal and business needs to seamlessly transfer from a primary connection to a secondary backup connection without any noticeable interruptions our hot failover technology has got you covered to aggregate your multiple internet connections together and combine their individual bandwidths you can utilize our bandwidth bonding technology you can also create a jitter-free data stream for experiencing smooth and uninterrupted Zoom calls and team meetings with our Wan smoothing technology to have access to these speed Fusion features you must first achieve two endpoints to create a speed Fusion tunnel these two endpoints are usually two physical peplink devices if two peplink devices aren't available then an alternative is to use speed Fusion connect protect also known as sfc protect or you can also use Fusion hub these are highly affordable and versatile subscription Services provided by peplink the key difference between both of these is that sfc protect provides speed Fusion as a service while Fusion Hub accomplishes this as a software Appliance essentially these Services act as or give you access to Virtual endpoints allowing you to create speed Fusion tunnels with just one physical peplink device sfc protect is a service that gives you access to peplink hosted virtual endpoints all around the world Fusion Hub on the other hand is another alternative which can allow you to utilize speed fusion with your peplink device and an existing cloud-based service in this video I will demonstrate how to set up a speed Fusion VPN between two physical endpoints my balance 20x and my Max HD2 let's get started now as you can see I have two and control tabs open one for the balance 20x and another for the max HD2 also I've assigned a local ID to both devices so that both devices can identify each other this should be done under the speed Fusion VPN local ID section as shown over here the default local ID is usually the model name combined with the device serial number so first I'll start by going to the tab for the balance model and create a new profile under the remote addresses section there are two items that you must input in order to have access to the pet VPN this includes the name and the remote ID and pre-shared key the remote ID for me is the local ID for my Max HD2 device which can be found on the advanced page of my second tab the remote IP address or host name is optional now you can head over to the traffic distribution section right below for the latest firmware 8.3.0 we use the dynamic weighted bonding as the default setting we also offer additional options for experts with specific configurations in mind for the one connection priority section the default setting is for all the wants to join the speed Fusion VPN if your device supports VPN bandwidth bonding then you can assign multiple ones with the same priority otherwise it supports hot failover only once that is complete you can click save and then click apply changes now we can move on to setting up the max HD2 similar to the first device you need to create a VPN profile so that you can connect to the first device which in this case is the balance 20x the items that you have to input include the name remote ID and pre-shared key and finally the remote IP address or hostname this time the remote IP addresses or host names is not optional because the second device needs to find the VPN hub the IP addresses can be found on the first tab under the one connection status section once that is complete click save and apply changes your speed Fusion VPN should be good to go now to determine whether you have successfully set up the speed Fusion VPN head over to the dashboard under the speed Fusion VPN tab you will be able to see whether the connection has been established in order to analyze the performance of the speed Fusion VPN on each device you can conduct a speed Fusion VPN test separately this test can help you to monitor the rxtx lost red and latency chains for an individual device during the test"}

connected to a router to achieve these Network types first I'll explain how to configure your WDS Network to start you need to head to your web admin page for the root AP this is the AP that is directly connected to your router then click on the AP tab at the top now you can head to settings on the left here you can configure your specific AP configurations and settings to your liking then head to the WDS on the left here you can press add to add your AP to a WDS Network and select the frequency band that is suitable for your network use now head to the web admin page for your second AP device then head to the AP tab at the top and click on settings on the left this section allows you to configure your WDS settings for the second access point after that head to the WDS tab on the left and add your AP to the WDS Network to monitor the status of your AP device and the network go back to the root AP web admin page and then head to the mesh WDS section on the left here you can monitor the type of network and device the pure Mac the protocol the recovery rate the signal strength and finally the uptime duration if you want to monitor the event log then head to the event log on the left here you can observe the paths created from node to node and also the user access the same actions can be performed on the web admin page of your second AP to monitor its status as well now I'll explain how to set up the mesh Network for the mesh Network it is vital that the main router is connected to the WAN Port of the root AP to start the setup head to the web admin page for your root AP this time you need to head to the AP tab on the top then go to wireless mesh tab on the left here you can set up the wireless mesh Network to do so you need to create a mesh ID select the

speed this can be done by conducting two different tests the pet VPN test and the wine analysis before we get started I will briefly explain what these speed Fusion features are hot failover is a specific feature of peplink speed Fusion technology that offers the opportunity for you to maintain session persistence this is achieved by seamlessly transferring traffic from one wand connection to another in the event that the first one connection fails or disconnects this is extremely beneficial as users won't experience interruptions in their Network or for online applications such as VoIP Google meet Microsoft teams and zoom another speed Fusion feature that I will help you set up today's bandwidth bonding this feature allows you to combine data at the packet level enabling you to combine the speed of multiple connections this is especially useful in situations where bandwidth is scarce this technology allows users to gain access to the internet in remote locations providing companies with the opportunity to create branches in different locations as they will have high speed and constant contact with the headquarters great so now that you understand what the technology is I'll briefly explain the network topology to achieve a speed Fusion tunnel you must have two endpoints meaning two devices are required one device is the host which usually has an Ethernet cable and a fixed public IP if you don't have a static IP on this one connection then you can also register it with a supported ddns service to create speed Fusion to the one ddns host name the other device usually has an Ethernet or Cellular Connection with a dynamic IP in this demo I'll be using two separate balance 20x routers to achieve a speed Fusion tunnel also to achieve speed fusion and manage your speed Fusion tunnel you need to have access to in control 2. so make sure that you have an active subscription for that the firmware needs to be either 6.1 or 3.41 which is the bare minimum but to have access to our latest features make sure you update to 8.3.0 and 3.9.3 as mentioned previously our goal in this demo is to achieve a speed Fusion tunnel and set up the hot failover and bandwidth bonding features then at the end we will also conduct tests to make sure that these features are working properly great so let's get started now the first step is to log into in control 2. make sure you've already added your devices to your organization once you've logged in head to the speed Fusion VPN tab at the top then click on configuration here you'll need to enable the speed Fusion configuration and add a profile you can choose the topology you want to create for this demo I'll be creating a star topology then head to the hub devices section here you need to select which device will be the Hub or the host device and you need to input its IP address then for the endpoint devices section select your endpoint device now head to the profile options section here you can configure your speed Fusion VPN settings such as setting up the VPN encryption and the type of bonding whether it's normal bonding or dynamic weighted bonding for this demo I'll be disabling the features like wand smoothing features and forward error correction once you configure your speed Fusion settings to your liking click next your speech Fusion tunnel should be ready now let's start doing the speed test before we start it's important to note that the speed Fusion overhead is 19 of the total transmitted data this means 19 of the overall bandwidth will be dedicated to setting up the speed Fusion tunnel and the encryption speed Fusion uses a fixed number of bytes per packet transmitted an additional 80 bytes therefore speed Fusion bandwidth bonding is much more efficient when transmitting larger packet sizes for example for a packet size of 1 500 bytes speed Fusion adds just five percent of bandwidth overhead but at a packet size of 40 bytes the speed Fusion overhead Rises to 200 percent first we're going to start with the one analysis test to do this head over to your web admin page for your Hub or host device then click on the system tab at the top now you can head to Wine analysis which is under the tools section on the left here you can choose the type of test you want to conduct whether it's TCP or UDP you can also choose the direction that you want to test whether it's upload or download speeds finally the duration of the test can also be customized before you start the test you also need to input the local one connections under the data streams section on my second device I have a 1 and a Cellular Connection so I'll input both and also put in the remote IP address which can be found on the dashboard of the web admin page once you've input all the required information you can go ahead and click Start once the test is done you will have access to a table and a graph to see the results on the table you can also see the overall pure one-to-one speed now I'll demonstrate how to conduct a speed Fusion VPN test first head to the web admin page for your endpoint device then head to the status bar on the top now on the left you should be able to see speed Fusion VPN click on that after that click on the arrow on the top right this will take you to a page where you can see the status of your speed Fusion VPN in more detail to start the test head to the speed Fusion VPN test configuration section and click on the type of test you want to conduct whether it's TCP or UDP the direction you want to test whether it's upload or download and the duration of the test you can also disable one of the connections to isolate the connection you want to test so first I will test the speed Fusion one one connection so now I have to disable The Cellular Connection once you've done that click Start after the test is complete you'll be able to see the speed Fusion vpn11 overall speed which in this case is around 32 megabits per second now I will disable the one connection and enable the cellular2 connection to test the speed Fusion VPN cellular to speed after that you can start the test as you can see I've got my speed Fusion VPN cellular to speed which is around 16 megabits per second finally I can test the speed Fusion VPN bonding speed to do so I need to enable both the one and The Cellular Connection after the test is complete I can see that the overall speed Fusion VPN bonding speed is around 40 megabits per second this is much faster than the speeds obtained from the individual Wan and Cellular Connection meaning that we've successfully achieved bandwidth bonding to obtain faster speeds now we can move on to the final test in this demo the hot failover test for the hot failover test I will disable the cellular one connection on my second endpoint to see how fast the connection can switch and transfer the traffic to the main one connection to keep the speed Fusion tunnel alive to start you need to First head to the status tab on the host device then go to The Client List here you can see the IP address for your different devices after this open up the command prompt and confirm the IP address for your device that is connected then figure out the path to the internet including how many nodes or hops now you can keep checking the destination while disconnecting the one cellular it should show request timed out for a brief moment before all the traffic is switched over to the one connection but the speed Fusion tunnel will still be alive the whole time also the time it takes for hot failover to work and for the traffic to be transferred to the wine connection will be shown on the command prompt page clearly it's very fast as it's in the millisecond range now when I remove the ethernet cable as well the wand connection will be down and the speed Fusion VPN tunnel will be disconnected"}

a ticket and contacting us we have also provided a few resources for you to look through in order for you to get your answer and clear your doubts faster so without further Ado let me show you the steps you can follow to get the support you require first head to the peplink site then go to support which is located on the top right corner when you scroll down you will find the submit a ticket section click on log in here you can find the steps previously discussed for resolving your issue or clearing any doubts in a quick and simple manner the first step would be to check out the knowledge base peplink has a large and loyal community of users that are constantly sharing their experiences or knowledge on peplink devices might be a chance that your concern or inquiry has already been solved by one of the active users on this forum the fastest way to check if there's any relevant information to your inquiry would be to head to the search bar and search for a key word pertaining to your issue so let's say I need some support related to outbound policies then all I need to do is type in outbound policy after that an advanced search column will drop down make sure you select the knowledge based category you can also filter your search to a more specific level by selecting tags the date posted and controlling the order you see your results this will help you save more time now let's say you have some concerns related to Firmware but your Hardware is absolutely fine then you can move on to the next step which consists of checking for any firmware updates provided by pep link our Engineers are constantly providing firmware updates to fix any software bugs that might be present this link will take you to a page where you can find out what the latest firware is for your device also you can find the user manual and other notes for each firmware furthermore if you need to download the latest firmware for your model or device you can find the download link here as well if you're not familiar with the different series and cannot find your exact model here are a few tips for you if your model has an X in the name then it'll most likely belong to the X Series if your model has the word balance in the name then it's probably part of the balance series if your model has a cellular modem then there's a high chance that it comes under the Mac series although the ubr and Transit models are an exception to this rule if you aren't sure about which firmware you're using then you can head to in control 2 or the web admin to check on in control 2 if you select a specific device in your organization and go to device details then you can find the hardware revision and firmware version of your specific device for the web admin page if you scroll down to the bottom you'll find the firmware version installed on your model in case updating to the latest firmware was not the solution to your problem then the next step would be to obtain a diagnostic report to do this first you need to connect to the web admin interface with a web browser if you have a Max router then you can type in 192.168.1 to access the web admin page if you have a balance router then you can visit 192.168.1.1 to access the web admin page then go to status and click on device here you can find the download button next to the diagnostic report field finally if you still haven't found the solution to your problem you can go ahead and submit a ticket the support team might ask you to enable the remote assistant service so that they can better diagnose the problem and assess the situation the steps for enabling remote assistants differ for each model for the balance Max Fusion Hub and surf Soho models you need to go to your web admin page and then if you scroll down on the main dashboard you will find the option to turn on remote assistance if you're using a pepwave AP1 AP Pro or Flex AP then you must go to the status tab on your web admin page then click on device and under the system information section you will find the option to turn on remote assistance now I'll explain how to use pep Link's ticketing system there are some boxes that require some input in order for you to use the ticketing system this includes inputting your name email ticket subject type of inquiry inquiry details country deployment status and allow changes or reboot device for the inquiry details if you submit a file like a picture or PDF then you can click add attachment to make things easier you can submit the diagnostic report so that our customer support team can have some context with the status of your router once you input all the required information you can go ahead and click create then your ticket is officially submitted and you will be issued a ticket number to confirm whether your ticket was successfully submitted check to see if you have received a verification email the verification email will contain all the information you have submitted in your inquiry it will also contain a link which will lead you to the ticket thread to access the ticket thread you need to log in with your peplink ID or you can use your Google Microsoft or Apple account after you've logged in you will be able to see that your ticket has been assigned to one of our customer support agents now all you have to do is wait for our diligent support team's prompt reply if needed you can also initiate a chat with them to further clarify any doubts"}

"in this video I will demonstrate how to set up a variety of zero touch configurations and other settings on end control 2. the zero touch configuration essentially is a method that allows you to configure your peplink ecosystem for various applications remotely in control simplifies this form of network management by aggregating Network information and presenting them an easy to read reports you can now push configurations and firmware updates to hundreds of devices with the click of a button and apply schedules to ssids Wi-Fi radios and SD switch ports there are a wide variety of different features and applications included in peplink's zero touch configuration through in control 2. seven features to be exact this includes bulk configuration Remote device IP configuration bulk outbound policy configuration bulk firewall policy configuration centralized firmware management centralized SSID options and finally customized captive portals first I'll start off with the bulk configuration features bulk configuration is the option that allows you to manage all your peplink devices that are connected to the same network simultaneously this is achieved by pushing a master config file to all your devices this feature is commonly used in businesses and institutions that are using multiple peplink devices in their Network by using this feature businesses and institutions can conveniently manage all their routers with the click of a button now I'll begin the demo the first thing you need to do is log into in control I'll start off by introducing how to set up the bulk configurator to enable this you need to head to settings then head to bulk configurator then you can press upload new config file here you can upload the config file that you want to install on all your devices you can also select which device you want to upload it on and also schedule the date and time that you want the config file to be uploaded next I'll go through the Remote device IP configuration Remote device IP configuration is a feature that makes it easy to manage specific devices by using the IP address of your device this can be done remotely and involves pushing a pre-built config file to your peplink device with the specified IP address this feature is also commonly used in businesses and institutions that want to manage devices with a specific IP address like for example the devices from a branch office or a specific Department to set up the Remote device ipconfiguration head to the settings tab again this time you want to click on device IP settings here you can import your IP settings a template for each device series is also provided once you have the IP settings ready you can go ahead and upload and push the configuration to multiple devices now I'll be going over the bulk outbound policy configuration bulk outbound policy configuration provides the opportunity for you to apply traffic steering rules from a master config file which can be pushed to multiple Pepin devices at the same time this feature can be used in every industry or even personal networks as different users have different network priorities and requirements to enable bulk outbound policy configuration first you need to go to the network settings tab at the top then click on outbound policy and tick the Box manage outbound policy on balance and Max devices after that you can go down and press edit this will cause a pop-up window to appear where you can control the preservation of outbound policy on devices the default setting is for the outbound policy rules to be preserved on the device rather than being cleared out once you've done that you can click save then click create rule set this will open a window called group setting outbound policy here you can set the outbound policy rule that you want and the devices it applies to after you fill in the required section click add rule then another window will pop up allowing you to customize the enablement source destination protocol algorithm local distributed weight and availability keep in mind that the algorithms are what determines how the traffic is distributed the different algorithm options are the way to balance algorithm which allows you to distribute the traffic across different one links based on their weight their individual weight is a priority ratio that you can designate for each one connection this algorithm is commonly used in cases where a user needs to assign more traffic to a faster one connection or send less traffic to a connection with a bandwidth cap the priority algorithm which is another algorithm allows you to Route traffic to your preferred link as long as it is available priority links need to be arranged from highest to lowest priority the priority algorithm is commonly used for scenarios where a user has a main one connection to use and leaves a secondary one connection as a backup connection the enforced algorithm is an algorithm that restricts outbound traffic to a particular connection regardless of whether that specific link is up or down this algorithm is commonly used for scenarios where users only have access to a specific IP or to a server this algorithm can also be used in conjunction with priority meaning that selected traffic can be routed across VPN connections with a priority and enforced algorithm the low latency algorithm is another algorithm where all new traffic is assigned to the fastest connection based on the connection latency time the fastest connection is determined at predefined time intervals during which test data is sent to all healthy connections to calculate their respective latency times this is commonly used for time-sensitive applications such as professional online gaming the Overflow algorithm is another option that prevents traffic flow from slowing down when the connection runs out of available bandwidth the Overflow algorithm is most commonly used in cases where available bandwidth is low but the performance of the network cannot be jeopardized this is especially important for maintaining traffic flow speeds this algorithm can also be used with the least used algorithm and the lowest latency algorithm to ensure optimal utilization of all ones the next algorithm is the persistence algorithm this is similar to the Overflow algorithm in that it prevents traffic flow from slowing down when the connection runs out of available bandwidth the key difference is that the specified types of traffic to be routed through the one links is based on the source or destination IP address this algorithm is commonly used for eliminating the possibility of session termination related issues for e-banking https and other secure websites the least used algorithm is when you route traffic to the most available one link according to the download usage this algorithm is commonly used to ensure that the user is routing traffic using the connection with the most available bandwidth and finally the fastest response time algorithm sends the traffic through the fastest connection based on session response from that destination this algorithm is quite popular for online gaming as well since it is ideal for time-sensitive applications once you've selected your algorithm and input the additional information you can go ahead and save the settings moving on to the bulk firewall policy configuration this is the ability to extract firewall policies from a config file to apply to your peplink devices this is especially useful for industries that have a specific firewall requirement such as the finance sector and are utilizing multiple peplink routers in their Network this way the specific firewall requirements can be met and installed on all pepting devices at the same time this can also be beneficial for individuals who are trying to achieve a very secure network to apply the bulk firewall policy configuration you first need to head to the network settings tab on the top and then click on firewall rule this will take you to a page where you need to select the devices that the firewall applies to and below that you can find the section to apply a configuration file containing a rule set after uploading the file you'll have the option for device selection and the option to further choose the outbound inbound and internal Network firewall rules as well as enable the intrusion detection and dos prevention click save after setting up the configuration options as for the centralized firmware management feature as the name suggests this is a configuration that will allow you to create and manage firmware policies for your peplink ecosystem one of the key elements of this feature is that it includes scheduling firmware updates for all your peplink devices this feature is extremely useful for users that have implemented multiple pepting devices into their Network infrastructure and want all their devices to be up to date this is also useful for industries that cannot have any downtime in their Network and can only install firmware updates on their routers during specific periods of time now to set up the centralized firmware management configuration click on the settings tab on the top and head down to Firmware policy this will take you to a page where all the devices in your organization will be listed along with their respective firmware here you can select which firmware you want your product to use which product you want to upgrade and you can even include custom firmware if necessary once you've done that you can also select the schedule and then click save changes for the next feature I'll be focusing on the centralized SSID options with this feature you can create and manage Network wi-fi options this includes SSID Security Options and more this is a crucial feature for all users and is applicable to all Industries this feature is commonly used to customize the network SSID and implementing a password-protected wireless network to control the SSID option feature head to the Wi-Fi AP tab at the top then click on group wide SSID settings on this page you can enable device schedule management then you can press add this will open a pop-up window where you can Define the custom schedule after you click save you'll have the option to configure your SSID settings such as choosing the devices to broadcast the SSID at the bottom you can also select the previously defined schedule the final feature of the zero touch configuration is the customized captive portal this allows users to create manage and completely customize landing pages for their network not only are users given the chance to design their landing page but they can also add different settings such as enabling social Wi-Fi login for guests this feature is useful for industries that have a specific Network for guests and would be applicable in areas such as airports shopping malls and even offices to set up the captive portal head to the network settings tab at the top and then click on captive portals this will lead you to the page where you can set up new captive portals we provide a variety of access modes such as social Wi-Fi login Open Access guest account login token email and even SMS also if you click preview and customization on the bottom left you'll be able to preview the custom portal and customize the entire custom portal screen to your liking this includes selecting the text font colors and background for the custom portal"}

{"topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "thanks again everybody for joining us this is another installment of our peplink University series I'm Travis durik with product manager with peplink and as always we've got Professor P Peter West here to talk to us about GPS and all the different ways that you can use GPS within the peplin products yeah I'm pretty excited to share this too because you know a lot of the work we do especially with mobile Health mobile command vehicles and um you know Fleet Tracking with like ambulances and fire trucks things like that we uh we get asked a lot about the capabilities of our GPS and so being able to create a single video that shows off the just the magnitude of features that pebbling has built into their ecosystem with GPS is going to be a lot of fun I think it's going to be a really enlightening conversation because I think you think oh GPS it has it on the map and it shows some where it is but there's a lot that peplink has built and it's going to be um you know really nice to have all this encapsulated into one video yeah yeah I mean it's just exactly there's so many different layers and different things will matter to different people but you know it's all related to that location aspect and you know just how you want to use that and different ways that you're able to so yeah let's jump in sorry mine slides there um so one of the the first things is I uh that peplink wants us to highlight which I think um is probably one of the coolest unknown things about peplink uh GPS is this GPS dead reckoning um and when I say unknown like prior to a month ago I didn't know um you know it was when we were planning for this webinar and they're like have you played around with the dead reckoning and I'm a little spoiled uh you know being being in the public ecosystem I don't have any vehicles that aren't using mbx 5gs I've never installed a br1 mini on any of my fleet vehicles and so I've never even noticed that that this wasn't even a this was even an issue for some people um and so but I think it's really cool that peplink has this and and basically with this dead reckoning technology on our dead reckoning supporting Hardware the um dead reckoning automatically estimates your current track and fills in the gaps based on last known position Direction distance and speed so if you're driving if you're driving and you go through a tunnel it'll simply just keep that going assuming that you're going that that you know 50 miles an hour or whatever it is trying to help you through the nogi guess space and what's interesting is is when I drive around you know I drive around in my speed Fusion vehicles um the Renegade and the Patriot um and I do go through tunnels and my GPS never does drop and so I know that this works I just never knew that it didn't work on on other routers if that makes sense um yeah so it's it's kind of a cool feature that peplink has added with kind of silently um which is which is neat and yeah oh on the positive side is it silent and that you don't have to do anything it's on and it's working and you have it but we've been silent about the fact that it's there and that's just not okay we need people to know that that's that's available that's something that happened you know in a lot of cases they've already bought so yeah and it works as as low as the br1 pro 5G so so we have the br1 pro 5G the br2 pro the um the max HD2 which is kind of cool um I mean that's uh that's right I wouldn't have expected to have that technology and then you have the obviously the mbx you know uh HD2 and hd4 the mbx mini the Dome series and the PDX um and so all of these support that GPS dead reckoning so you don't have to have a twelve thousand dollar mbx um you could have just a br1 pro 5G and have this dead reckoning on your police cars or ambulances or um you know things like that as you're traveling around but it is I mean that's a really neat feature that uh they definitely could create value especially when you're trying to compare GPS features with the also the speed fusion and other benefits the ecosystem that peplink offers yeah I mean like on that br1 Pro 5G again you know that's under a thousand dollars it's a 5G router that's ready for mobile environments so if you're going up against a either a cheaper device or a more expensive device does that have dead reckoning support you know if it's a mobile environment that might matter a lot exactly um the other thing that peplink has is GPS 40 and and it's important here that we should say that it's GPS forwarding to multiple destinations with multiple different configurations um and so you can have for example reporting to your CAD server you can report to a to a GPS tracking server um or whatever so you know you can have multiple GPS destinations with different time intervals different protocols um and then you have your your Nema and your uh tie app um yeah I always spell that one up once again on top of dead reckoning now you can have GPS forwarding and so you you not only you can have in control Cloud management but we have this the ability to send multiple GPS destinations for your Fleet and or um different systems that might need to know the GPS location you don't need to have a whole bunch of GPS receivers you have one pep link sending to multiple applications tracking those your Fleet of your Fleet and I think that creates a lot of value as well yeah I mean if you think about like a public safety scenario you're going to have like a centralized CAD server that that system at dispatch that needs to know where all the vehicles are and then in the vehicle you're going to have the the cad console for the for the officer on their computer in the car and that thing would like to know where you're at too so yeah I mean you need to feed this to multiple locations and it's all right there pretty straightforward well we had a really cool scenario too where um people were um different divisions so you have like um the county and the state um we've had it you're sending to different different groups as well um oh yeah like kind of like your your little local section versus your your larger overview um where they're collecting all the information yeah that's a good point because a lot of these agencies they don't answer anyone but they work with a lot of different departments co-working with other people yep uh sorry my there we go uh geofencing uh is another neat thing that peplink has built into with our GPS so if you're using in control and then you're also using uh our GPS capabilities you now have the ability to do geofencing which lets you add notifications um turning off and off uh turning on and off uh Wi-Fi applying tags based on on where you are and and this allows you to do a lot of different things one of the most one of the most things that I use it for um on a regular basis is when I pull into my building my property at my office I don't want my what my uh my devices using my my speed Fusion Renegade or the speed Fusion Patriot Wi-Fi I want them using my West Network's Wi-Fi and my building so what I do is when I enter the zone of my prop my my parking lot the Jeep the Wi-Fi on those devices gets shut down so it turns off the Wi-Fi when I enter uh the parking lot and then when I leave the parking lot the Wi-Fi turns back on um and that just prevents me from accidentally connecting to the wrong Wi-Fi um when I'm in my building because you know if you have a a 42 G on the roof of your vehicle broadcasting Wi-Fi it'll easily go inside your building and you'll accidentally connect that using cellular data instead of um you know your nice high-speed Wi-Fi data yeah just you know the fact that you can make tags either appear or disappear you know because tags drive so many different configuration parameters in the system so then you can kind of sequence those things in to have you know all kinds of different changes happen when you enter or leave an area and um I think the other thing is just really cool is just firmware updates like don't do a firmware update if this vehicle's out in the field only do it when it's in the Geo fence back parked at Depot right so if you've got you know critical Vehicles out there moving around you're not going to interrupt them because you don't know when they're going to be back you just know where back is and yeah just easy way to use the GPS and then the email notifications allow you to see when something enters or leaves an area if you have a multi hundred thousand dollar command vehicle or or you know mobile operations you know you might want to know hey is this does this leave the area on an unapproved time they have sent an email a note to the uh whoever's in charge of that area to make sure that vehicle is supposed to leave um yeah I just email or those you know HTTP https notifications so you can tie this to some other system too so you can do the integration if you need that trigger to you know set some other thing in motion yeah so geofencing is definitely um neat especially like I said with the tagging and the Wi-Fi and the notifications and I've had customers get really creative with the tagging functionalities um the uh I've had some custom you know customers get really creative with tagging you know because if you're tagging applies to you know to outbound policies firewall policies um you know bolt configurations and so we've had some really interesting um use cases where they've gotten really creative with geofencing and tagging and making changes to the device based on based on where it's located yep which can make you know if you've got a thousand locations you can automate a whole bunch of stuff again and get back to that kind of zero touch provisioning concept and just use the GPS as the differentiator then and then you know the next thing that peplink GPS tracking does is uh Fleet Tracking so if we are using peplinks in control two uh in combination with any of our GPS or mobile devices you you now have the ability to have Fleet Tracking built right into in control too and it is incredibly powerful and there's some features in this um that not only can you use it for tracking and knowing where your devices are but you can also see um you can click on that little blue line which I'll show you during my live demo but you can click on that blue line and actually know how fast the vehicle was going what the cellular capabilities were at that location um and so there's a lot of data that's actually being tracked at the same time which gives you a lot of visibility into what's going on one of my most my most beloved story is related to this is I was working with a company out in Arizona well funny enough I'm in Arizona right now but I was working with a company out in Arizona and there if you go out into the the Northern parts of Arizona it's very rural and and so there's only a couple cell towers for a very large area and the customer called me and um they said hey look I'm having a hard time you know we were on the internet we were working and now we're not we're just dead in the water and so I pulled up the the Fleet Tracking I clicked on when when performance and Wan analytics saw that the cellular connectivity was green and then went yellow and then when it blew and then red and and I was like oh I think I see that you're right next to a building can you back the vehicle up a couple hundred feet and oh yeah it's a big parking lot let me move to the other side and I said yeah if you move back about 100 maybe 150 feet um I see that you were connected and sure enough they backed up and then the vehicle got connected to the the the internet and they were back up and running so even though I was in Florida the vehicle was in Arizona I was able to use the GPS Fleet Tracking capabilities in the cellular tracking capabilities to be able to see that when that router went offline and where it was when it went offline and so hey if you can move to that other area you'll be able to get reconnected it was just kind of a really neat thing for me because it was one of the first mobile peplink routers this was years ago but it was one of the first ones I deployed and it was like boom this is amazing feature just was available to that you know to solve that problem yeah I love that because so many times you go to look at these maps and it's kind of like you're looking at a chalk line right it's like why did It suck is is all that I'm able to answer like oh because I lost a signal right but in this case you're using it to make it actually work again not just explain why it didn't work and so yeah that's a great uh great way to use that and be able to actually give them some you know quick advice out in the field that mattered and the details that it provides is GPS Fleet Tracking is pretty pretty intense I mean you can see the speed the altitude um you know uh and and even more details about where we where where this vehicle is and what it's doing um and it's all I mean what's crazy to me is it's just there I mean you know I kind of beat up on the the licensing stuff but it's just there this is just part of the ecosystem this is part of what dumpling offers and and I I it blows my mind um some of these features that they just add yep and that's exactly our purpose is like this this feature that feature won't matter to every single customer but if you're in warranty and subscription you've got it you don't have to think about it it's just there um and I mentioned this just a few minutes ago but part of our Wan analysis capabilities or when quality reports is the ability to use that GPS tracking to actually see very specific detailed land quality reports uh using the GPS and so you can track and I love I use this when I'm doing for site surveys if someone calls and says hey I want to do a site survey of a particular area I'll say okay give me four or five um addresses I put I put I take my my speed Fusion we're in a gate I'll have Verizon T-Mobile um and ATT as well as my starlink and then I drive I just get in the car and I drive I drive to each destination then I pull up the GPS tracking and I can see the quality of ATT Verizon T-Mobile and starlink as I progress through that area to see where my my disconnects occur and so and I can tell the customer hey this part of like this part of the parking lot is better than this part of the parking lot or if you were to you know as I was pulling in I noticed that this area was much better than that area and so I can I highlight specific areas where the connection might be better for them to park or to to location for the day um and and I and for me it's so so easy I mean the the mbx is installed in my Sprinter I've got the antennas on the roof I just I just I just drive and then pull a PowerPoint and copy and paste um and so I find that to be you know a really powerful capability especially for troubleshooting if you're managing a large Fleet of vehicles it's so hard to go every single minute of every day what's going on and this allows you to go if someone puts in a ticket hey I lost internet well you can see the date and the time and the person so you can pull that vehicle up go to that date and time and see what were they doing where were they what was their connection what was what was what were they what internet connections were they on and you can see this historical information that allows you to understand what happened yesterday so if I don't get to that that incident ticket until today I can still have that data from yesterday and that's important that's really important for for help desk operations the other thing that I really like is just even if you don't have that absolute Clarity of like this is the time when my problem was if you know just roughly you can use the tools and really narrow it down to only the places where there are problems really quickly so you don't have to have all the information to really get into the to the weeds of it and find where the problems are quickly um the other thing that I thought was really cool um it's been it's been around for a little while since they integrated the time server I don't say like uh what seven seven one two I think we've had times we've had time server for a little while but you know now we have this GPS time source so you can actually use GPS as your time Source if you'd like to um instead of syncing with like uh an online presence and this is really good especially if you're in low bandwidth requirement areas you know you can sync with GPS and have you know much less bandwidth utilization or reliability on on the internet to to use for that time source and so being able to choose your GPS as your time sync is a is a great feature on these Max routers yeah it's ultimately probably going to be the most accurate time Source you can have out in the field and so you know use that first if you've got it and that's kind of how it works too is if for some reason GPS isn't there it will fall back to the traditional you know network-based synchronizations but if it's got that GPS clock it'll it'll use that more precise Source then and then we also have the GPS net clock server um so peplinks added our own ntp server so not only can you sync your GPS time now the peplink can be a time server for other devices and that is just I mean we talk about once again these this ecosystem or these features you know the ability just to sync with time have a great time server now your pebbling router is your time server so your time your peplink router which provides you internet also is your Fleet Tracking and GPS synced time server and so you can actually turn on the time server set it up and then in um DHCP if you just turn on your you know point to the uh the pep link as your time server then you'll be able to do that yeah if you've got cameras phones um or or if you're in you know Public Safety or a healthcare environment where you know the time stamps of those systems matters too you can point all of those devices to that Lan IP of the peplink and that can be your authoritative accurate GPS based net clock so you've got that on device you know basically bulletproof time sync so that you know you're you're recording every little incident at the exact time that it happened yeah I think especially everything moving to SSL these days I mean time stamps and time accuracy is really important for certificate management so keeping that accurate and having it locally on the devices just another another great feature that peplink has added to the ecosystem yeah absolutely so um so those are the basic features now I'm going to just kind of show where these are because that's part of what I like to do is advertise the features but then also highlight where these things exist in in the real world um and so um I have oh that's my ubr for today okay so so I'm using the Renegade the Renegade is my uh my uh Vienna Renegade uh little peplink Sprinter unit if you haven't seen pictures of it I've got it on you know kind of LinkedIn and stuff and you can see about My ATT my T-Mobile My Verizon and my starlink FHP and I can see that it's sitting here in in Gainesville Florida right now um and so I the GPS tracking here so I went uh to the device and I went to last Friday when I was up in Chicago and you can see here's my last Friday when I was up in Chicago driving around if I click on so full screen icon here oh there it is and then I can zoom in and if I click on a piece of time right here I can see the date stamp how fast I was driving my lab too longitude and um my altitude um and so I can see where this vehicle was how it how fast it was going at any point time which is kind of cool because if you're worried about you know Fleet Management and speeding tickets and or where you are you you literally can see exactly how fast this vehicle was going as I went down the road which is I mean it's especially with a large Fleet that's a that's a pretty neat deal um because you get the exact time stamp and the speed but if I go up here and go to reports when quality reports I can get a little different view of this information so I can choose last Friday like I mentioned already and then let me just say show all and so this is my starlink but so I have my starlink My ATT my T-Mobile and my Verizon so I pull up My ATT there we go and I can see my ATT connection there and then I can see this heat map that is the entire trip that I took and so you can see right here um this is My ATT service and so what I like to do is compare like ATT against Verizon and T-Mobile and you'll see these dots they have um three three rings you have the the outer ring the inner middle ring and the center ring and that is your and you might be able to correct me if I'm wrong here uh uh Travis but it's your your signal strength your quality and then your signal to noise ratio right yep okay um and so um so we have that you know right there and we can see that and then I can click on that spec and now I've get um let me see if we can zoom in on this one before you guys there we go so you can see right here it shows me what cell IDs are there what carrier what bands I'm using Band 2 14 and 30. um I've got my um signal ltea my latitude longitude and you have all of my different um signal quality and latency um specifications right there for that location and so I can dig into these locations and see exactly what's going on with at T at that location and then once I once I Look to analyze ATT I can scroll down and look at Verizon for example wait for it to refresh there we go so now I have Verizon and I can zoom in on this area and see that same details for Verizon and what it's doing and so the WAN quality reports are incredibly nice because that links with that GPS but it also lets me know what the quality of those services are as as I'm traveling around and I find that to be just it's infinitely valuable for the type of work that I do especially when I'm trying to figure out the best carriers in an area um and what's going on and why they might not be because you know if you notice all these have a green Outer Circle I mean they're almost all get a good signal it's not the signal it's the quality of the service that matters um and that's where it's really really different um you think that it doesn't matter but it really does because the um um and that that outer that you think oh I've got four bars I got three bars well how good is the signal um Beyond just this the bars and then I can pull my favorite my favorite thing to do about the map at the bottom there I want to just have you try it uncheck the filters just leave latency checked but just check uncheck the rest of them so what I like to do here is this this is showing basically every spot where your latency went above that threshold then so you've got a 500 millisecond threshold or yeah so then you get again you can get right to the bottom of like okay here's where I probably had problems right and then you start kind of look at that conversation backwards like was it signal or was it something else right yeah something impacts my quality here that's crazy but you know sometimes that threshold can be harder or easier to find try go try doing the greater than 500 on the latency yeah here we go so now now those are where you know that carrier had problems or potentials this is where this is where T-Mobile had a greater than 500 milliseconds of latency at yeah and usually it you know aligns heavily with signal or something like that but not always right so yeah and you can see what well what is nice is you can see that the signal actually at these areas all of them have a red Outer Circle so they all have that they were all not so great on the uh the signal quality yep not very mysterious right we know why that went high on that one um yeah so then um for and then so then I'm going to move over to geofencing just to show this off geofencing is absolutely crazy so um so in it so once again speed Fusion Renegade um settings and then geofencing and then here I I create I you have this disabled Wi-Fi and so it's just around my office here and so what I have is action enable disable Wi-Fi and it says on Leaf enable on leave disable and enter and so as soon as I enter this area so I you know I pull in pull in the street and as soon as I hit through this area the Wi-Fi turns off and that way it's not interfering with my devices that are inside my building but I also have the ability to do email notifications so I can say send an email to Peter westnetworks.com if um if I'm if if if I enter or leave this area um I can also do it uh like uh Travis was saying we can do an https uh notification so we can push this to our to our system if you have a support desk or or um uh event log tracking system that supports Json pushes you can just push that right there and that way it subtracts hey the vehicle enter the vehicle left now you have time stamps of when the vehicle came and uh entered and left the particular area um this could be really good I think for public service or Public Safety right you know yeah the vehicles at the the police station or or the hospital wherever and then when they leave it creates a sense of a notification to their system and documents that time stamp and when it comes back it documents that timestamp mm-hmm um and then you have device tagging and so this is kind of neat so I can say for example uh enter um tag stick tags to add on enter so I can say at office tags to add on leave I can say um you know uh deployed so if I enter that area it's going to add a tag at office so if I have a whole bunch of vehicles and I want to show all the vehicles that are at the office I can just filter by that tag I can also apply policies like hey turn off speed Fusion or disable uh you know around because if you're at the office I don't need this um and then there's this checkbox allow apply firmware so if I have firmware scheduled only turn on the firmware only allow firmware pushing when I'm at the office that way these guys are out in the field they're not getting firmware pushed in the middle of doing a deployment yep yep I'm at the office I'm just going to use the Wi-Fi as wan to connect my vehicle to the office instead of burning cellular gigs when I'm right there next to my landline and Wi-Fi network yeah and so then it pushes that out and now I've got that GPS tracking capability for the GPS tracking too um you can add zones um so for example I can say um a one I can add so I can add a circular area a circular area CSV upload or path um and so so you can define an area like I Define the city of Gainesville by a path and you know draw draw a path and say hey if I'm inside this area um that's my area or I could just draw that Circle so if I wanted to get really particular I could draw a path that's around that that block of my name of of the office and then have it turn off or enable based on that path or if I want to say say my my vehicle is only supposed to this particular vehicle is only supposed to cover you know Alachua County which is the county that my city is in I could draw a path around Alachua County and basically say once it leaves lasso County send an alert notification like hey this this is left just jurisdiction jurisdiction or um it's going where it's not supposed to go yep and those are things where I've seen people you know use existing geospatial files that they've got and we've been able to work with them to get those imported if if they're that specific but yeah there's it's just a lot of ways that you can use that to just not have to like draw something that's not very precise if you've got the better data we can figure that out usually exactly um and then we have GPS forwarding um so GPS forwarding is um is the ability to not only work within control but also work with your own CAD system or whatever platform that your application that you might be using and you can add a lot of destinations so you know so you know um the one thing that you can't change is whether it's going to be Nema or a tie up so you do not tie up and PV and CP or you could do Nema and then you can check your your uh sentence types um and then so you can't do those individually per destination and then you can add a vehicle ID if you'd like you know like the uh the Renegade um if I wanted to and then I can add my destination your your IP address your Port um TCP or UDP and then the uh report interval so how many seconds you want it to send it um and then whether or not the stationary right there so there's your stationary uh options as well um and so once again you can send this to a lot of different destinations based on on your your company's need uh solving those you know those unique challenges from needing a whole bunch of different GPS receivers to serve one purpose if you're a programmer peplink has one of the coolest apis in the world at least I think they do I'm I am biased uh they don't call me Professor Pete for nothing um but there is a full-featured API and there's actually two apis we have the in control API and we have the balance API so you can write your API to integrate to interface within control and use in controls authentication protocols and or you can have it right directly to that router and and query uh GPS and things like that but and since it's a GPS conversation I'll talk about just about GPS but I just did a little quick search and you can see there's eight different uh sections here for GPS and so if you're curious about this you can simply literally just Google peplink in control API it'll take you right to it um hit OK and then you can you can see all the different commands they have um but you can query the device's location if it's a fixed location you can actually update the location on the GPS location via the the API and so there's a lot of things you can do inside of the API and I just wanted to Showcase this as well um showing off the just the the breadth of capabilities that exist um with the GPS and in control as well as the balance router yeah and the API thing is something we've seen people use in so many different ways again we've got people with you know either robotics or Vehicle Systems where they're using the local API to you know utilize that GPS feed somehow locally and then again other people using the cloud side everything that you've shown here Peter already is available via the apis to you know get all those maps all that cellular signal data that's all yeah available on the back end too so and that's important right in control is basically the API into the devices and so everything you see on in control is just an API and we've had customers write their own interfaces I mean their whole entire kind of in control for their own private use and so that API is open and available to be used and that's just crazy that peplink just has that available um without any licensing or anything like that yeah um good question from Jose is that uh GPS dad Reckoning is not available on the max HD2 Dome well the HD2 Dome is brand new so I'm gonna assume it is because it's based on the br2 but I think you've probably got we've had an HD2 dome for a long time on the LTE oh the LTE Dome I was thinking the new 5G sorry yeah yeah um so do we know if it's available on that I'm the newest ones if it's 5G yes most of the 5G radios don't have a GPS chipset in them and so we're putting an external third-party chipset with that debt Reckoning support on those devices so the old one probably doesn't support the dead reckon correct yeah okay I would expect the old one does not the LTE versions of the domes um somebody asked about um 8.3 and GPS not working that's more tech support if you want to reach out to either Traverse or myself um or your partner we'd be more than happy to help you troubleshoot that um but yeah we you can just open a ticket or take a look at your your configuration for tech support purposes yeah definitely yeah is there a limit on the number for sure yeah uh is there a limit with the number of boundaries that can be set set up via geofencing I don't know I've never been I I don't know if they're I mean I'm sure there's some sort of Technology there's some limit but yeah I don't know where that is yeah not anything that we've ever hit I mean we have customers with a lot of geofencing policies um so there there might be a some sort of you know item limit but not not anything small it's not going to be a small number sorry I can't use that exact specification we could probably reach out to Michael and ask if there's anything you can always push the feedback button in in control and highlight the thing that you're curious about that because yeah that actually is a really good point um if if you uh an in control let me just pull this up go to GPS if you just click this feedback button right here in the GPS geofencing you can simply just ask that question right here and the in control team could be able to answer that so you just click this and just say hey is there a limit to the uh the number of geofencing uh locations and then they'd be able to answer that question uh for you you know the vehicle stationary so let's continue huh that one uh the guy asked he said if a vehicle stationary and it loses connectivity it can trigger a left geofence or enter geofence um I don't really because because it's losing connectivity I'm not exactly sure how that's handled do you do you by any chance no Travis I think I don't have a good answer I mean yeah I'll have to I'll have to follow up on that one because I I I hate to say that but I'm always I've got you know 12 different internet connections I'm like online I don't I don't really lose internet for me to I've never experienced that particular issue there but it shouldn't though because when it's offline like if you have a router that's offline the GPS shows it in that area yeah it's odd that it would like register a movement if it didn't have a precise fix that said I would say that that might be a really good uh report to Michael as well is just clicking that feedback button here and just letting them know that you're getting false reports based on offline status because it shouldn't the GPS it saves the last known location um so it's going to stick that last known location so there might be some scenario there where it's picking up incorrectly I've definitely seen scenarios like it especially in Northern latitudes where you know you'll get some odd drift if you're parked next to a big obstruction and you know you can see some weird kind of like zigzaggy patterns on stationary objects sometimes but you know maybe looking at like they actually did move but not so much related to startups shut down at all it's something different than what described there I think but anyways um so dead reckoning is not an enable you can't turn it on and off it's sort of just on um so so if you're if you're having gaps uh that might be related to connectivity not GPS like if it can't report to in control um so you might want to look at that the the WAN quality alert and see if you're losing connectivity or devices going offline um otherwise open a ticket and and maybe check your settings because yeah you don't turn the GPS dead reckoning you don't turn on and off correct Travis this is definitely a question for you do we have a small low-cost device that can only do GPS tracking without Wi-Fi would that be a like a a br1 mini core the cores don't generally have GPS so yeah there's just not really um you know a beer One Mini would be the closest device but is the SG does the um does the SF does the sfe have it oh no because that's not low cost radio yeah those are kind of expensive yeah I would do the br1 mini right and then just turn off Wi-Fi is what I would do because that's gonna be your least expensive sometimes especially to devices are a little bit more expensive than the just just turning off the Wi-Fi yeah where you can even just physically cap the Wi-Fi Port if it's really that big of a concern yeah um [Music] uh this would definitely be a question for Travis slash the uncontrolled team I do agree with you uh Chris on this um but um uh Chris asked a really good question about the how long this data stays if Chris says he knows the date range isn't uh in control or limited to 30 days it'd be great to remove this limit um like visualizing a full full trip of logs for for boaters and rvers um the only thing I would say Chris is that that's probably that GPS forwarding So like um we actually play around with that ourselves and and I just send that that data to uh to a GPS receiver and then I then I play with that data myself um for long-term travel um but I don't know if if peplink would have any interest in removing the the data limit the storage limits there yeah I mean a lot of data to manage for us so I mean I think along the lines what you were saying Peter you know some way to automate the export of it or you know get that out there in a way that you can still use it but um yeah I don't know I don't know I'm not trying to shut it down but you know yeah in its current state it's just a lot more data yeah there are free GPS receivers out there um literally you can download it and then send that GPS location and then you could create um I know that my marketing team because we have our our different speed Fusion installation Vehicles we're looking at creating live maps that that show like oh Peter's going here then he's going here and and so we're looking at creating more long-term um because once again that even querying the data is um on on a shorter date range it's like today or yesterday and so I want to be able to say hey here's my trip this week and then you know oh we installed a br2 and we did this and we did that and so um so we're using the GPS forwarding feature to go into our own GPS software then we just put that into Google Maps API yeah maybe it's maybe it's more you know maybe it's more about the goals of what Chris is looking for too of it's not so much all the details from a year ago I just need to know know where I was a year ago and we can drop the rest of the details after a month I I don't know right I think again I think there's probably a better solution here for sure but it's not just as easy as make the date range longer I guess that's all I'm trying to say um Sam asked a good question he says does the geofencing turn off the Wi-Fi when or just the Wi-Fi Lan I think it turns off the Wi-Fi which would turn off when because I think it's triggers triggers no yeah I don't know I will uh Sam if you don't mind I would love to answer that question for you if you want to email um Peter westnetworks.com or Travis peplink.com I'll I would love to answer that question for you uh more specifically um I do apologize I I actually don't know if it turns off because I know it triggers the off it's like when you when you do it it triggers um I know it will shut the app for sure yeah so it shuts off the AP which I would assume would turn off Wi-Fi when um but I actually have never tested that um yeah if anybody's in in this chat that's that's watching I'd love to know but um yep there you go Sam just said I try to turn off both yeah I was thinking it would I didn't want to say that for sure but it does turn off the AP so um if if you don't want it to turn it off then that's where tagging comes into place because you have Wi-Fi ssids that go by tagging so if I did a tag like for example I just added this tag if I go Wi-Fi on some devices with the um deployed tag well now that that SSID is only applied to the deployed and so literally when you when the deployed tag is removed the SSID removed that would keep the Wi-Fi radio on if you want Wi-Fi when so so that's where you could use the tagging to keep the Wi-Fi radio on but but turn off the Wi-Fi SSID yeah and I actually like that um distinction or the ability to have that distinction because I know about well I've got one customer who has a whole bunch of devices that end up at a Depot right next to a military base and they do not want that Wi-Fi energy coming off off that bus depot and so in that case it has to be shut off the radio not just you know shut the SSID off so it yeah I can see why you would have two different ways to get almost the same result there yeah um uh any like I said anything else um you once again you can email Peter westnowers.com or Travis at peplink.com um if anybody has any other questions uh related to this I'd love to answer those we do have a couple more minutes otherwise we could give you guys back a few minutes of time so I'll wait just a minute for any additional questions but yeah so but otherwise I think thank you so much for joining um if you have any suggestions for our our next month's topic um if we choose your uh uh if we choose your suggestion we'll send you some cool swag um oh hold on one second somewhat unrelated okay on one second I would Joseph asked a question that's sort of not related um Joseph uh I would either reach out to your partner unless you are the partner um or if you want to reach out to to myself or just peplink support we'd be more than happy to look at this your scenario should not have happened um so there might be some sort of configuration issue and or failover scenario that that didn't didn't get set up properly but we'd be more than happy to troubleshoot that for you that by definition of the failover that shouldn't have happened so just either reach out to peddling support your partner or or My if you don't have anybody you can reach out to me and I'll be more than happy to help you get get that looked at awesome well thank you yeah thank you so much everybody and once again if you have any uh topics uh for a webinar if I choose your webinar I'll send you some free swag um so please email it to either Travis peplink.com or Peter westnetworks.com and be more than happy to to take that if you have questions or need support once again you could reach out to either one of us as well and we can get you in contact with the right person we understand this is a um kind of an open-ended webinar so if we can't help you we will definitely get you in contact with the person that can help you absolutely well thank you so much Travis thank you for for posting this with me and yeah yeah thank you now have a great have a great day I'm gonna go I'm gonna go install some br2 Pro 5gs this afternoon so yeah all right folks take care have a good one"}

today we are happy to introduce you the in control of cloud-based management system that said coupling solution apart from our competition So within control you gain access to a comprehensive management platform that empowers you to efficiently overseas paddling device and networks from a single interface to show you the unique features of peplink and the benefit of the in control of the network monitoring so we have invited two passionated partners of mountain sandwich is our certified pce trainer and also um Josh is our certified pcss trainer so um to uh they actually come from End to End Surfing the Australia and New Zealand Market uh they start the business or start selling pipeline for for the past two years MTM actually has been growing per person after my family uh it is growing very fast so we're exciting uh to introduce them and let uh invite them to share the opportunity for bringing that link to the market and we believe many of you may not yet are aware of the potential of benefits of yeah how to of starting a partnering business so now I passed the time over uh to them thank you thank you uh Cassie yeah and uh look what we're going to talk about today is uh a little bit about our experience um as Cassie introduced uh M2M has been uh relatively new to the uh the peplink uh family and uh we wanted to share with you some of our experiences of how we've taken the peplink technology to Market and what we found at a high level there are two groups of customers that we talk with there's groups of customers that have who have been dealing with pebbling for a long time and actually have a really good understanding of the technology and then there is the net new customers that haven't heard of peplink and they haven't heard of um uh the product seat or the suite or what the the technology can do so it's a completely new engagement for them so what their presentation is going to be today is going to be uh what we do when we talk to customers predominantly new customers to the pebbling story so in essence what does how does Pep link differentiate itself from the market and when we look at that in control 2 is a very very key feature of uh of that uh of the product suite and our first point is as a sales organization for peplink we always lead with in control two two first we do not lead with the hardware we talk about the capability of the solution not an individual product so let's dive into a little bit about what does uh how how do we position peplink in the market so people use this marketing uh slogan called that they position themselves as they supercharge connectivity I put my own spin on it I I I'd say to customers pebbling provides the best internet connectivity for any point on the planet let me say that again pebbling provides the best connectivity for any point on the planet now I know that that is a provocative and a bold statement so how can I make that statement and the answer to that is very simple using the peplink Technologies pebbling takes all the available Wang connections to any point on the planet be it on land they're in a vehicle being on a boat even in the air and it adds little bonds it together to bring all the available Wan connections together to provide one stable and reliable internet connection so peplink isn't just an SD Wang company it's almost Bolder than that it provides supercharged connectivity everywhere so what we'll do is take you on a journey as to what that actually looks like I'll talk about it from a theoretical point of view but more importantly we're going to show you this in action and you'll be able to see how this technology can be deployed so what does peplink do as I've alluded to in my introduction it bonds together or brings or combines together all the available Wan connections that can be obtained at any point um where this device where the edge device is situated so combination of fiber and Broadband uh 4G 5gb a private or consumer satellite technology you know be it starlink or one web or even Wi-Fi as Wan is you can combine all of those available land connections to provide a faster more reliable internet connection anywhere and that is the Core Essence of what and the core proposition or differentiator of what peplink does so if we overlay various market segments and we look at the connectivity through a couple of lenses we look at it from Wireless connectivity where at an entry level and then there's incremental need for better connectivity better than eventually to essential or even a mission critical connectivity and then we overlay key industry verticals what you see here is a very high level map of where pep link plays and the first takeout on this slide is it's a very comprehensive view of the connectivity Market probably the biggest exception from here is peplink doesn't play in consumer so we're not positioning the product as a consumer based solution but anything from smaller medium Enterprises up that's where peplink really comes into its own and the solution that we talk about when we talk about bonding and we'll get into that in more detail is the same application fundamentally just been deployed in different degrees uh in each of these levels of connectivity and we'll demonstrate this more and more as we go through the presentation some customers ask me when I talk to them about pebbling they say I've never heard of the company tell me about it pedling's been around for nearly 20 years so it's a long-term player in the edge infrastructure environment and now I refer them to the Gartner magic quadrant for sd-wan and show them the pep link is part of this Elite and esteemed group of Industry players playing in this uh this market so this is a a document that you can refer to with your customers in detail if needed and peplink's position in that is strengthening over time and I believe will continue to to play a more and more um significant role in providing reliable Communications in the future so what is the peplink product Suite how does it how does the whole stack look well in the middle you can see pebbling offers a range of Hardware so that's be it uh wired or Wireless or a combination of both so there is a piece of Hardware that will fit a particular environment and today's session we're not going to get into that just take it that yes there is the right piece of Hardware that'll do the job sitting above the hardware is a control platform uh called in control too so the the predominant and most common deployment is the cloud-based solution and this allows you to manage and configure uh and monitor your peplink devices it's good to note though that the purple Link in control 2 can be acquired as an on-prem version so where data sovereignty is an issue for your customers you know be it in government some military type customers you know local government as well this is a really an important consideration so paplink provides a solution for both of these situations the key differentiator for peplink is the bonding which I've mentioned and that is marketed under the term speed Fusion Technologies and the next couple of slides I'm going to talk to you in a little bit more detail about what this is and how it works and the benefits that it delivers your customers and it's good to note that the peplink technology can run on any industry Cloud platform you know that you and your customers are using you know be it AWS or Azure or whatever the case might be so what is speed Fusion technology the most significant one and the key point of this presentation if you're not taking anything else away take this point that is when um bandwidth bonding and this is where you take multiple Wan connections so you might take a fixed connection and two uh Cellular Connections one with carrier a and the other one was carrier B so you've got three active connections and you bond that together and you bond that together from The Edge device to another pedaling piece of equipment or software ahead end so between the head end and the edge device you've got a bonding scenario so in layman terms One Plus One Plus One will give you a throughput but out of 2.6 or something like that there is an overhead for this bonding but it does deliver increased throughput and better reliability to your internet connection and the beauty of this bonding technology is that it can stand alone and the device can act as an sd-wan for your customers deployments or it can slot into existing customer sd-wan Solutions and be configured in a pass-through or a bridge mode and solve connectivity for areas within the customers existing sd-wan where they cannot get connectivity and so the pep link can be used in both of those scenarios so again when bandwidth bonding is absolutely critical and it just provides the best internet connectivity so where would you use that right what would what would trigger a customer to say hey where would you why is this important we'll take for instance the starlink phenomenon that has occurred in the world in the last six months starlink has just taken off and styling by itself is a very good Wan connection but in isolation it's not bulletproof it has its ups and downs so you can Bond a starling which is a ultimately a best efforts network with another best effort Network better 4G or a 5G and you bomb those two together and you get a robust stable and reliable internet connection with any dropper dropouts automatically been compensated by the pebbling algorithms that provides the bonding so that is a real life application of where you can use bonding today with your customers so peplink have taken the bonding concept one step further and they've caught they've called this a dynamic weighted bonding and this is where the pebbling technology analyzes each and every Wan link and looks to optimize The Waiting or the amount of data traffic that it sends down each wan to give you the customers the most reliable and fastest configuration possible from all the individual Wan connections that exist this is powerful and it's this technology that allows pebbling to be optimized on these new satellite-based technologies be it you know one web or Star starlink this is allows you to get the absolute best out of these available internet connections another concept within the speed Fusion Smorgasbord is the idea of Wan smoothing and the concept here is slightly different to bonding but it's really on the same Spectrum just at the other end and in this scenario every configured Wang connection can be set out act as a a to send a copy of an individual data packet down each Wan link simultaneously so that packet a goes down you know where they a goes down packet line B but at the other end the first package that arrives becomes the the packet that's kept and every subsequent copy is discarded but what this does is it provides a single jitter-free data stream where speed's not critical but reliability is most important and that is very useful in um you know Mission critical uh M2M applications uh can be very useful in broadcasting applications both up and down so the pebbling technology in smoothing is very very useful that also within the speed Fusion solution you can almost set up a parameter that that's a combination of bonding and smoothing so it's almost like a Continuum and you can configure again for your optimal connection last but not least is hot failover now this is not to be confused with industry standard failover hot file over has the speed Fusion technology all running but data is only traversing down one active link and there's a second link active but on standby and if the first uh link drops for whatever reason or hits whatever parameter that you set you set for it to trigger the alternative Wan link it kicks in but without dropping the session without the requirement of having to create a new IP you know connection so you get a continuity of service and yet you've completely transformed the pathway of that internet connection so this is also a very very powerful configuration option these individual options can be configured in isolation or in some cases in combination again a very flexible platform so how does all this work does how does all this magic come together so peplink have created uh their own um pep or VPN tunnel between each of the edge devices and the head end which they refer to as a pep VPN and the system does that and it's very easy to configure but once that's established then you can turn on these wonderful configuration options and enable these features it's important to note that paperlink Solutions do behave and act like any industry standard Enterprise grade sd-wan solution so you can configure your VPN networks you can configure uh load balancing and quality of service and routing protocols you can do all that as well as turning on the speed Fusion options that we've just talked about and you can set this up to provide the optimal configuration for your customer so how does pebbling do that what are some of the terms well we touched on some of this already the first is the in control 2 platform so this is a subscription-based service that is bundled in with one year up front with every Hardware that you buy so you automatically get one year upfront with the hardware and this allows you to manage your platform and as I mentioned you have the option of getting this tool on-prem if you choose to I mentioned earlier the concept of a head end and peplink offers a number of solutions for the head end it can be another piece of paperlink Hardware but more commonly it's a piece of software which we refer to as the fusion Hub and this uh Appliance can be deployed in the customer's data center or if you're a MSP you can host it on behalf of your customer it can be hosted in the your own cloud or your customers version of the cloud or pad link also offer a publicly available version of that I'm not going to go into a lot of detail here about it but it is a very flexible and it's a very cost efficient way of deploying and making you know the solution come together and peplink is a subscription-based service so after the one year you can renew your license and the hardware warranty also is automatically renewed when you have all your product in in license so in control too at a high level is an amazing tool the first thing that I want to highlight is that in control 2 is designed as it's Grassroots it's DNA other being customer-centric so it's designed so that you configure the network environment for your customer it's not as like some of our competitors designed around the hardware or a hardware family rather it's designed around what the customer needs and every peplink equipment can be then applied to and and managed using the once off deployed customer configuration option so it allows you to configure once and deploy many times it does have sd-wan capabilities and it has a plethora of reporting tools that you can use to Monitor and control your network so when we look at you know the zero tax there's a lot of configuration options to make it very easy for you to uh configure and manage the devices and all the policies and all the things that you need and that your customers need to manage their devices can be set up and very easily deployed there's even features like captive portal which allows for information to be presented to any new person logging on to an SSID or a Wi-Fi connection again this can be configured and utilized as part of the solution the easy way to deploy and manage the device it's very scalable you can give access to groups and customer segmentation and you can give different priorities and access rights to various users so again very easy to deploy very easy to manage and make it work for what your particular customer is requiring each of the um the peplink devices that have a modem in them also has a GPS so you can enable this and this gives you a lot of uh Geographic functionality that you can use and um and then monitor your customers Network and there's a whole range of uh tools and Reporting and diagnostic um information so you can use to optimize and get the best performance out of your network pebbling also offer a version that you can download on iOS or Play Store and you can then manage remotely the peplink in a very very easy way as well as dialing in through the web portal so let me summarize here about what's going on what we have is an edge device that's out on site and that device is providing Land Services Lan or Wi-Fi services for your customers environment and from there it is then bonding multiple Wan connections together might be two cellular and affixed it could be two cellular and a satellite it could be it could be half a dozen uh starlings together there's no real practical limit for what you can do to provide that robust internet connectivity so between the edge device and the fusion Hub engine is yeah that's where the bonding occurs and then from the fusion Hub that that can be deployed out on the data can then be pushed out out to the internet or can go into a private Network so that's how the solution hangs together but there's nothing like seeing it in real life so I'm going to hand over to Satish and I'm going to ask him to show you what bonding is all about over here mate thanks Josh uh as we have seen through the presentation so far that definitely consists of in control to Fusion harm and devices in control to Elizabeth's cloud-based device management platform and as you can see once you load into it you'll land to this page this is design keeping msps in mind and you can see the organizations and groups over here so organizations and groups reflect roughly to accounts accounts with customers and groups within those accounts let's go on to look into one of the demo group accounts and organization and find out what it looks like so in the organizations as you log in and go into organization you can see the iconography change to Orange and that orange denotes that you are on the organization level you can see that it can customize a logo of that particular organization and add to this particular instance of your control too overall the organization there is a summary that you can see the devices that are online within this organization offline Services expired and actual total number of devices if you scroll down a little bit you see the groups that would have been created by the administrator and these are again towards totally towards administrators discretion there is no restrictions uh with relate to creating a group you can create a group and add any doubling family device into it such as an access point a switch or router and you can manage all of that from that field if you scroll down towards the bottom you see the grouping of devices within that in control to organization as to where the devices in that organization you can do a lot of policy based configurations on the organization level and its hierarchical model let's look into one of the groups and see what it looks like So within the group you can see the iconography change to Yellow that denotes that you are on a group level in the group level again it gives you a quick summary of what devices are available in the group and with the online offline I said earlier it's not agnostic and you can actually uh Define any devices as said on the switch router access point you can control all of them from here if we scroll down to its bottom again you have a grouping of devices as a GPS enabled device as you can see where the device in this particular group are located scroll down a little bit towards the bottom you can see in touch if you have configured in touch I'll touch upon it in a few in a second but if you have configured in touch you can access those in touch based devices from the book level itself and you have some even though underneath here all the devices are represented in accordance and with that columns you can customize those columns to new as you would like to see such as serial numbers you might want to see what sort of from where they are and you can see that and customize the volumes as per your requirement most of the computations on the devices will be done on this group level essentially create a template once and deploy multiple times so you can create the template of maybe SSID firewall tools Mainland networks and so on and deployment also times on different devices you can create multiple templates and add to a device and you can create multiple templates and deploy to a large group of devices based on tags or you can apply as a blanket to every device you can do the VPN configuration the step VPN configuration from the group as well as organization level and there are multiple ways of configuring the device so one of them is template based the second one is bulk configuration where you create a device template configure the device once that device is configured use that as a golden template and deploy multiple to multiple devices in the group if there is a specific requirement for each respective site then we go into device IP settings and that's another way of configuring the devices there is also policies that you can Define for the root level such as firmware policy or reporting or notification policies and you can apply to that let's look into the device and what it's look like so go to device level page you can see a lot of detail on the device level page and the iconographic change to White so now we have moved from orange to Yellow to White that is just a hierarchical model from organization to group to the device in the device level on the left hand side you see the physical characteristics of the device such as serial number the model cellular how long it's been up for how long it's been online for when it first appeared you also see that Society configurations on it also towards importantly explore down a little bit you see the event log and the configuration backups for whatever configurations you would have done on this device so far towards the bottom left you see there is a group of Port information and in that you can see which ports are connected that's representative of whether it's connected whether it's drawing power your choice is green if it's not connected it will just not light up the clinical if you scroll a little further you see that there's a GPS map over here if this is a vehicle application in moment while the vehicle is moving you can see that rough play out in this particular section in real time and any event that occurs at a particularly given point in time on a particular location in the map where the vehicle or the device is it will flag it and that flag will show as an event here and you can go through that location and find out if your van was down something occurred at that critical location where the device went offline came back from line back again you can identify that it's quite a handy feature for Fleet Tracking of the device all the vehicles towards the right right hand side you see the VLAN configurations these are the local networks that you have configured and also a huge amount of details available in terms of Bank configuration such as cellular you get a huge amount of details such as the IP configured which the card is in use what network is connected to what's the APN whether it's connected to a 5G or a 4G depending on the hardware you have and the list of frequencies that is active and this point in time So currently with that frequencies listed it also shows you what's the quality of signal you're getting what's the signal strength what is the signal to noise ratio all that information is very handy or troubleshooting and understanding whether your device is performing well towards the bottom you see the speed Fusion VPN configuration and in that you have the information such as what is your you know head and the fusion Hub and how this particular device is connected to it and if you scroll down towards the little bottom you see the actual character in terms of CPU load temperature power consumption at this point in time and keeps fluctuating as you as the router is being utilized further and further you can also go into remote web admin directly from the platform let me take you to the program button and find out how it looks like so this is a local page and of the device that we could we can directly go into from the platform and in this local page I'm just going to demonstrate what the speed vision technology is all about so if you see my connection if I have to run a quick download test you'll see that there is about two ethernet based down and connected to this you have four Cellular Connections inbuilt in this device it's HD core mbx and you have a USB based brand we have connected a 5G peptic adapter to it and you have a total of four plus three connections at seven connections and if I have to run a quick download test you can see pervan connection I get a certain download speed towards the bottom you will see the aggregate download speed this is the throughput you are able to achieve with these amount of links available and aggregated together so they are bonding together to provide a bigger pipe a larger bandwidth on this device and this is achieved through the speed future Technologies and at any given point in time on the edge device if you are to lose a certain connection so if we lose for example a couple of the same cards over here your session will not get disrupted your traffic keeps moving on however you lose a certain bandwidth because you've lost the number of links but when the Links come back on into the device they will start participating in the speed Fusion VPN and you will see that the bonding starts increasing again with the added Prime width of the of the links that were gone down and come back so overall you can see the bonding here and similarly this is a symmetrical link so if I have to just cancel this particular session of download and run a quick upload you can see that per device you get a certain upload and at the bottom you get the aggregate upload this is quite significant uh in terms of what you can achieve with multiple brand links if it's a single cylinder bandwidth you can achieve only an x amount of upload you can't reach that and if you lose that you lose all the connectivity in the bonding you can aggregate multiple warnings uploads and actually get a higher throughput this is significant in terms of what you can achieve with the throughput and similarity if a particular band link goes down the session will not get disrupted but you will lose the bandwidth because you've lost a couple of Van connections but when they come back on they will start participating in the uh plan aggregation bandwidth bonding and you will see the bandwidth boost up again once they start by so this is a quick quick demonstration of what a bonding can do for you and what you can achieve through quantity going back there's a couple of things that I would touch on uh is the reporting of the device the reports are available the device level the group level and organization level what I'm demonstrating is a group level what we refer to commonly as one of the reports that we commonly refer in our presentations is around quality reports what you see from the bank quality reports is you've got information about all the brand connections that you can utilize for understanding how your each of the land connections are performing what you see from my screen is the starting connection you can see there's High degree of variability in the starting connections there's huge amount of latency is at certain points some somewhere and it can identify compare that to a Cellular Connection and you will see that the seller connection is much more reliable compared to starlink however they're still best Networks and the beauty is one point that we have noticed is when you connect to starlings next to each other they don't behave alike and you can see the second starving has had and run up and down even in the same window that we have this and the beauty of speed Fusion Technologies is that when they are all bonded together a particular Landing going up or down will not affect the entire connection it will just drop out of that boundary and then participate back again when it comes online and you can you can see that having a combination of multiple networks will help you have much more reliable Communications and aggregated networks so that you are not losing connections at any given point in time and it comes continue on from your remote site to your head and or to the internet smoothly this another feature from peplink uh which is part of plan management which is one of a really good feature that you can utilize uh for connecting into devices that are connected to peplink so it could be a third-party device what we have today to demonstrate is a printer and a switch so basically this is out of band management from peplink definitely calls InTouch but out of band management why it will control two you can connect it connect to any device connected behind piplink uh as far as an high period IP related device it is network reachable and you can connect to that device and make sure that you can view it or do some troubleshooting anything it could be a PC it could be a HTTP based web application it could be uh SSH page app based application you're just doing a shell uh login to your server for example you can do it from the control two uh and also as I said it doesn't have to be a coupling device it could be any third-party's device and you can log into it for example here is a switch and you can configure that switch in case there's any additions needed or any new configuration needed while they don't have their own management platform it could be an unmanaged switch but there is a way to get to that switch through peplink through InTouch through autopilot management and access it configure it and so on thank you very much Satish for taking us through uh in control too from a a normal an initial introduction we typically don't go into a lot more detail uh we do offer often get customers to ask us very detailed questions and we'll go through and explain that but as an introduction and overview what we've demonstrated is in control too how it can be used very easy to manage a network and also show the bonding and you know people suddenly get this bonding and I just want to re-emphasize the bonding is brilliant when you're downloading but it's exceptional when you're uploading and particularly if you are a broadcaster or you were trying to get data away up from a remote location often the pebbling bonding solution is the only thing really available that can do that in a very cost efficient way so it is a remote solution so let me just share my screen again and we will just quickly do a quick wrap here so what we have talked about is what peplink has done but in fact peplan's been doing this for years and providing the bonding and the smoothing and and actually providing connectivity for places that just didn't get anything really but in today's uh day and age what's really important is reliability because there's more and more applications it's more of Our Lives just depend more and more on connectivity so you need to have that reliable Connection in all situations yeah and as we reflect back on Emergency Services you think about that life-threatening Mission critical the only real reliable connection is not to rely on any one connection you need multiple connections and you need them to be working and getting the best of everything that can be thrown at a particular location and that's what peplink delivers today and it has the right level of devices you know we've got the hardware that is suited to particular verticals you know we've got devices that are created perfectly for the brand we have devices that work exceptionally well in vehicles and there's a maritime range of devices as well for the harsher environment so the the peplink solution can be deployed pretty well anywhere so that concludes today our quick summary an introduction to peplink its key differentiator I.E y pep link and a little bit of an introduction into the income in control 2 platform in the meantime if anyone has any questions please feel free to enter them into the chat and if you've got any technical questions or any marketing related questions please uh yeah please ask how does peplink's dual SIM structure work within the devices every peddling device that has a single radio has dual SIM one is active and another is passive but if you have dual radios such as VR2 Pro 5G for example uh has 205g radios in that case you've got four SIM cards two per radio but at any given point in time you can have two SIM cards active so two active connections two cellular towers basically it could be different carriers and two passives you can have the second recent cost as a passive connection so when the primary goes down the secondary will take its uh the radio reboots and connects to the secondary SIM card but if you have two active connections even if one fails you have that one minute time for it to re come back online while the other continues to uh go on with the connection yeah it's very very useful and you can also optimize plan configurations as well uh using uh these tools well I want to thanks everyone for their time and attending and if you've got any questions please reach out to your local paplink sales team thank you very much thank you very much hey thank you everybody for joining our webinar today so you can stay tuned for the recording and the slides thank everyone"}

exam many of them can pass easily if they study the materials seriously and then before the exam however some of the questions seems that a little bit more difficult and to help the coming challenge to go through this so we that's why we organize this formula so today uh I really invited our certified pcss trainer Joey actually Joey this is on tmdb so uh he has good experience for helping our different partners to how to get food exam so now I will pass the time to Joey and explain some of the questions if you have any questions uh throughout the webinar so please feel free to leave the comments out in the chat or you can um uh yeah you can remember this and then we can ask it in the end at the end of the webinar so now I passed the time to you Joey thank you hi everyone a huge thanks for to the pebbling team for having us welcome everyone I will discuss the new pcsis exam today my name is Joey senior technical engineer with Frontier beefy before we start a few house rules the webinar will be recorded and available on the Forum on a later date and we will answer all of your questions at the end of the webinar so let's start with an overview of the pscss exam this is a new exam version of peplink's certified sales specialist exam this course is focused on getting familiar with the backlink products and Advising the best possible solution within the budget and requirements made by your customer the exam covers a wide range of topics including paplink's product portfolio Network design and basic troubleshooting the public certified engineer exam is a certified program designed for individuals who have a strong technical background and experience in the deployments and management of network products and solutions the pce certification is a step up from the pampling certified sales specialist certification and is intended for engineers consultants and I.T professionals who are responsible for Designing deploying and maintaining public networks so you would like to start your pcss course first you go to training.paplink.com login with your peplink ID and select a pcss course before starting the exam please read the guidelines and supplementary here you can find all there is to know about the exam and some study guides or handy links for studying the pcss exam consists of five modules and the questions are still multiple choice and practical scenarios multiple choice questions test your knowledge of Concepts and features while practical scenarios test your ability to apply that knowledge to real world situations how to tackle those questions we're going to explain how to work the questions find the keywords in the questions make sure you write them down and make the question easier for you to understand we have created a few examples to show you how you could tackle those questions with finding the keywords while doing the exam keywords consist mainly of products or product lines markets like Public Safety or what a customer is trying to achieve what their goals are so the first one the keywords are product line and Poe output this gives you the requirements within these questions the ubr is a product not a product line and according to the data sheet there is no Poe available Hardware therefore it will never be able to have Poe outputs enabled antennas are a product line but have no Lan Port capabilities and this leaves the SD switch as the remaining answer and the correct answer question two the keywords are in control virtual Appliance and Public Safety and so one is partially true because in control virtual Appliance could be hosted on privately hosted cloud service however in control is never an endpoint for your speed Fusion VPN tunnel therefore this answer is not correct answer three in control virtual Appliance doesn't allow you to have a private link for a pair of devices only it allows you to cover way more devices than a pair of devices so this makes answer to your correct answer and coming back to the keywords Public Safety with many projects within the public safety sector privately housed applications are required to comply with safety standards question three this is a long question and again we are looking for the keywords of this question the keywords are complete as the one ecosystem and replace their existing mpls because this is what the customer intended with this case study and allows you to answer the questions better and so one peppering routers are not carrier dependent therefore a peplink is independent from any carrier answer two the goal of this implementation is to replace and install a complete sd-wan ecosystem so no Integrations into the existing Network answer 3 is the only remaining and correct answer you can find this in the case study too and this is the exactly what coupling Solutions can offer here are some tips for preparing for the pcss exam one study the PCS exam guide thoroughly the study guide contains all the information you need to pass the exam all study information can be found on the general pcss 3.0 page take the pcss practice exam this will give you an idea of what to expect in a real exam and help you identify which modules you need to work on and four practice the pappling community Forum this is a great resource for getting answers to your questions and learning from other peplink users next up most common questions and how to answer them question one the Max hd2mbx has four Sim slots how many SIM cards can be used simultaneously peplink's Max series routers have the most occasions we've done in Sim slots with one sim slot does not equal one modem you can find this information in the data sheets or the max comparison the HD stands for heavy duty and the number represents the amount of meridians so HD2 if you have a customer would like to have four active SIM cards an hd4 and BX with four active SIM cards could be a good option again HD stands for heavy duty and 4 represents the amount of modems so answer B would be the correct one question two referring to the broadcasting case study in Germany on the paplink website the mobile broadcasting Studio would like to conveniently upgrade their current network with 5G what solution would you recommend so to rephrase this question and get to keywords the customer is looking for upgrade to 5G conveniently upgrade at 5G are your keywords answer C balance 380 and 2500. this answer is incorrect because the balance 380 and 2500 don't have integrated 5G modems you can find this in a data sheet answer B replacing the HD2 and hd4 with routers that have less modems and less convenient upgrades to answer hey adding a Max adapter is the easiest way to upgrade 5G with existing setup before finally answering this question I recommend to double check the Run options for the HD2 and hd4 devices question three an Enterprise with an established Network management system wants to add the capture portal to the network for guests to use which approach would fit this scenarios best this is a deployment strategy question and you need to know what the customer would like to achieve the customer would like to add the getter portal to their Network so looking at the options giving sidecar approach is more like a backup or a secondary solution full Network Gateway approach is a full network-wide change therefore adding a feature like Capital portal into an existing network is an inline approach as the current setup keeps for the majority the same structure so let's start with the most difficult questions and how to answer them question one referring to the super remote Sports case study although designed for transport deployments Subaru uses a Transit router for its broadcast and live streams so what makes this transcript useful for this application again like the other questions first find the keywords in this case features Transit referring to the transit duo in this case study so again like the previous part question one with the amount of SIM cards in HD2 and bxd Transit has two active and two redundant Sim slots and only one ethernet web port looking at the statistics and pictures of the data sheet there's also no mention of any USB web ports in that same data sheet you can see that the trans2 has options to be powered through micro USB ports so answer C is the correct answer question two an owner of an old hd4 router installed in a mobile vehicle wants to replace the device with a new multicellular 5G router but keep the current antenna which model would you recommend again the keywords are hd4 mobile vehicle replace or upgrade 5G multicellular and keep the antenna setup to start answering this question first we need to understand the old antenna setup the hd4 has of four modems and each 4G modem that is a cat 12 or lower has two antenna connectors this this means that four modems times two connectors is eight antennas the customer would like to go from multicellular 5G router answer a the balance 310 5G is a multicellular router but only offers one 5G modem and one 4G modem therefore not 100 compliant with the customer and succeed the ht1 done pro offers you one-time 5G modem and changes your antenna layout and so B looking at the mbx mini data sheet it has dual cellular 5G Modem with every 5G modem having four antenna connectors with two modems that is eight antennas and therefore you don't need to change the antenna layout question three a financial institution recently experienced a network outage they are looking for a new approach with a backup failover option in case a network audit occurs again which approach fits past this scenario again this is another deployment strategy question and you need to know what the customer would like to achieve the customer would like to create a backup Network for failover to their Network so it's looking at options given answer C full Network Gateway approach is a full Network wide change and this will replace the current setup completely answer B the inline approach is adding a feature into an existing Network as the current setup keeps the for the majority the same so answer a the side core approach is adding a second feature in this case a secondary or a backup solution to the existing Network operating them side by side and not interfere with the existing Network next up sample questions yes okay so we got today a few sample questions for you and you can answer those questions in the um and in the chat uh we give you a few uh seconds to to put the answer in and then I will explain uh why this question uh and why this uh answer is is the correct answer um so let's start with the first uh question so when smoothing is one of the features of speed Fusion when enabled the public device duplicates ends since redundant packages across multiple Vans to make up for the packet loss and minimize latency so for what applications would this technology be useful for so put the answers in the chat and we'll wait for a few seconds and and try to help with the keywords and try to understand the question because it's a very long question so it's really reasonable to uh book case I see a lot of questions already that's good everybody's very fast um let's see what the answer is all right and so B I think most of you all got it right um so the reason why and so B and and going over the keywords when smoothing speed fusion and uh enabled applications so um the the keywords here tell you in this very long question what did what the what the most important things is and one smoothing is of course a feature speed Fusion that allows you to minimize packet loss minimize latency um therefore it's really useful during VoIP video stream zoom and team calls to have that live stream going really really good all right let's go to the next question if three seller links are required for your network which model would you choose so again looking at the question then question and looking at those keywords you have three Sellers and required so the customers is requiring you to have like three subtle links he wants that that's his his goal and how do you say want to achieve that he wants to have them both active at the same time so look at it really good and see what uh what the answers are all right see what the answer is okay yes very good so the b01 mini has one sim card active BR stands for business ready um and the one stands for one modem active so so one modem will be active at the same time the bl1 mini has two or Sim so you can place two SIM cards in it the HD2 Dome has HD stands for heavy duty and the two stands for two or modem two modems so this will have four SIM cards but you only have two active at the same time so this will not be viable for the customer so the only option is the max hd4 even though the four cellular modems you can still use Three Links there's only two dual or or quad modem for the max series if you really want to only use a free modem but this is not the answer given you can also go for the sdx with a triple 4G modem all right let's go to the next question so private yard uses vset connectivity as a main link do it limited bandwidth the owner wants to adult 5G connectivity when the vessel is by the coast but still retain vset connectivity when sailing away from the shore which model would be best for this network right go ahead type in the questions find those keywords let's see if you can get it a hundred percent score today that would be great all right seeing a few questions coming in all right let's see what the answer is and so a well done well done to everybody um so again looking at the keywords vsat 5G adopt and retain vsat those are the keywords you want to take out from this this very long question again and the given answers the balance 310 for example doesn't have a integrated 5G Network you can find this in the data sheet or on the balance comparison on the peplink website the max adapter as well looking at the data sheet and um on on the comparison the Maxis data 5G doesn't have a Wan Port so you still want to use that reset connectivity you need a Wan Port therefore uh answer a is the correct answer so let's go to the next question uh it seems that uh this one is very easy we're gonna make it very easy for you guys today but again uh I'm gonna explain this one then uh for the tourism and hospitality industry guest Wi-Fi is offering a basic expectation which of the following pep link Solutions addresses this pain point so looking at this and also looking back to the uh deployment scenarios you want to integrate something and you want to keep the current Network so in this case you want to know the keywords and that's tourism and hospitality and guest Wi-Fi so guest Wi-Fi is really important in in those Industries and peplink routers support guest networks via Capital portals and this allows you as well to advertisement and data collections um from from those those devices so even though benefit building provides affordable high-speed connection via multiple multicellular routers um this is guest Wi-Fi we're speaking about they want to um give a little bit of simple and easy to manage controller so get portal is the best way to do that and and so a peplink's infrastructure provides device for all requirements at different price points that is correct but it is not going to help for this specific industry because this question is for this specific industry and um I guess Wi-Fi is designed and and the captive portal is designed to to help especially for the tourism and hospitality industry it can be used in in many more scenarios but one of those key Industries for capture portal is the tourism and hospitality industry and you can find this in the capital Portal information page on the website as well all right so let's go to the next and last question okay so users can access different different backlink platforms after creating a coupling idea with their email address but instead of remembering a new password coupling offers possible alternatives to continue the login process which of the following is an alternative all right let's see if you know this one this is a this is a tough one all right see something answers incoming let's see who can retain that 100 score I'm wondering how many people now go into the uh peplink ID page and looking up so the answer is hey well very well done I just do all see very good answers really impressed um so yeah this one uh you can log in with your Apple uh account as well um if you go to the weblink ID website or you go to any pipling website like the Forum or in control uh or speed Fusion connect Services you can see that um you can find the Apple logo and you can log in with your Apple account as well um yes so for for Facebook and Linkedin there's no login possible um there might also be different login possibilities but those are not mentioned in the question or in the answers so yeah we'll see how it goes so um those are the sample questions um that's it for this presentation so if you have some answers or some questions I can answer them in the Q a um okay what would be the presentation percentage to pass the exam and I'm gonna retry the exam for pcss I think is 80 yeah 70 okay um is still still a cost for the exam uh Cassie do you know the answer for this one uh not yet uh tested for this so you can go to just like what it's like in the beginning of the slide saying that going to the training.com so the pcss has five modules and then you can just uh take the modules uh one by one when you have time in case you are fail either one of the program you still don't worry about this because uh you if you do not get a passing Mark in module 2 for example uh we we check for the overall Mass so if the overall you get over 80 percent then there should be no problem so you do not need to retake the exam you can also got a shirt if you can of for example other modules you got the full mask only one more juice you cannot take it and if the average can pass it and then no problem but in case you want to retake the exam please feel free to send an email to marketing at public.com uh saying that or certification at patlink.com so we will continue that extra we try on the exact so that will be no problem and for the cost actually are we if you join this webinar if you know about uh this that you can if you are our partners then you can also send email to us we will waive your costs for uh for for any retakes or for any uh things that you want to join again yeah yeah so yeah partner to sign up to take the test actually you uh just I said just go to thetraining.partling.com that should be no problem yeah they have some promotion is actually in the previously uh the training dog of having.com actually have two only two exam certification modules in the landing page but um let's see if my teammate can share the screen for the new current training portal so that you will see uh currently not only have two exam listed there but we also have listed out all many verticals information there if we kick to any verticals and then you will see a lot of organized materials yeah so you can see that uh the landing page once you log in us just like the questions you can log in with pathway ID or with your Apple or with your Google Gmail account so once you uh chat inside and then you can see the top selling freshly and tell operations are trained trending vertical market and also if you want to study uh individual one just let's see if we click on the main tag then you will see the solution page our wallpaper the vertical notes case study and we have another specific specific mpce and suggested model from information like this so these are the latest we update the platform so that the partners or end user even can just go here and then try to find out the materials easily yes okay is there always one possible answer in a multiple choice or sometimes more than one that's a very good question actually well pce actually we still have the multi answers way to choose so when we ask the questions then uh it does not specify how many credit or how many rounds are there and people would think that this is too difficult but the pcss for the sales engineering uh with some that maybe uh we want to mainly we change the focus we are not testing of picking the all correct answer but in pcss we only got one single and correct answer in the multiple choice questions this is what we want to uh more concentrate on the key message for the pcss so so pce yes there will be multi multiple choice answer for the multi-mc questions but for pcss no you just got one single correct answer yeah okay all right okay sorry I must have not got the care I was thinking I don't have the answers or those and some possibilities in my test but uh then uh yeah because there's of course a cycle of a lot of questions and that is very very nice um I got one more question uh what would be the best way to a partner to sign up and to take the test well I think you just go to training.papling.com create if you do not have it yet create a pathlink idea and you can also find again those uh Apple uh logo for example and I believe Gmail as well so if you don't want to have a new password you can log in with that as well um but also if you struggling with the with the questions or you have failed the first try don't hesitate to to reach out to one of the trainers on the publink website like me there is there are more uh people around that can help you out um so and also just go to your uh people that that deliver the backlink if you really want to get a training and there's always somebody to help this community is very very helpful I believe so um so how many times you can take the test um there is a lot of possibilities um like Cassie already said you can go to uh send an email to marketing if you failed and we can uh make a make some changes to it but in general it's every two months or three months correct me if I'm wrong uh Cassie but uh that's uh how much time it takes to to get a a new um uh try for your exam so I think thank you very much for joining to explain the questions to us and then I think he shared a very important skills is uh for the questions look at the keywords and then search for the related information from accounting website or from our trading materials this exam actually is not difficult but maybe sometimes just maybe you go for the questions maybe kind of answer very too quickly and so when if you have any uh mistakes on the questions don't worry uh if we can you can try to retry and then send an email to us and then we will try to reset it for you so we the example itself actually is just one of the partners to have better understanding of public differentiations and our basic important knowledge so um any things you want to go deeper than yes as Joey said go to our public.com and then the training tab to see what others pcss trainer is nearby to you and encounter them and then yeah we will try to help so thanks for your time I've spent everyone times today if you still have any questions please feel free to or any webinar that you want to uh listen or you want to study more and then let us know we will send out the survey uh after uh this may be a couple weeks a couple days uh maybe today tomorrow or next beginning of next week so uh any feedback thank you so much for joining us today thank you very much thank you very much thanks Joey yeah all right have a good day bye-bye say bye"}

I'm Travis Derek with peplink I'm a product manager here at peplink and we've got two guests today with us to talk about Laura Wan we're going to talk a little bit about Lauren in general and then we'll talk about the pep link um the peplink solution for Laura Wan and so we've got our two guests today we've got David Smith from get wireless he's the VP of iot solutions he's got long history in the iot world and specifically also in lorawan so very happy to have Dave with us today and we've also got Mike Anderson from get wireless he is the senior director of product management at for the pebbling product line at get wireless he doesn't like that senior word but I threw it but funny things we just talked about that you threw it in anyway awesome I had to do it I'm sorry that's great so yeah we've got a good panel here today and like I said we're gonna dive in and talk to you about Laura when technology overall and what the peplink solution for Laura Wan looks like okay yeah so uh uh thanks Travis and I figured you know kind of put a little bit of agenda together for this session uh the first thing I thought we'd talk about is the architecture right you know what what does it entail you know what do you need to get Laura win up and running and then talk about some Laura win examples that are out there uh and all the different things that you can do with it I have a couple of things set up today and maybe show you some stuff and then talk about what makes peplink different with Laura Wan um why peplink right and then get into a demo and then open it up for Q and for Q a and you know see what people are asking out there um so I hope that's a good agenda is that we okay with that anything else we want to add I think it's great but as always folks feel free to chime in on the chat we'll probably take most of those questions at the end but don't be afraid to throw them in there now and we'll be happy to talk about those as as we get to the end I'm a little new to zoom so I don't know where the chat is but that's okay I'll find it all right I'll manage that stuff for you okay thanks I'm like I don't see a chat all right all right so let's let's kind of talk about the Laura Wayne architecture it is a little bit different um but uh um you know it's pretty simple um so this is where Dave and I can you know kind of interject but the first thing you need is that application server you need something that to communicate with that Laura Wan then you need the network server and then where peplink will fall in is in the Gateway side of it and then that's got to communicate with the base station and then you get all the sensors so uh to me you know the the way this is set up it seems a little bit you know uh right to left um and I think I normally go left to right so it's a little bit different because the when you deal with Laura Laura type stuff um the sensors are the most you know the thing that's out there that's the that's the most visible thing um so I have a handful of sensors here I have a motion sensor or a vibration sensor I have a temperature sensor and then I have a push button sensor and you know again that's going to talk to um the I have it connected to my balance 20x and in the 20x I have that Laura Wan module plugged into the back so those that's how the sensors are talking to the Gateway and then from there it's going to go to an application server um Dave I don't know if you want to talk about anything in network architecture wise um yeah just kind of quickly went over it happy to the whole basis for Laura Wan is considered like a hub and spoke so you have an end device a sensor and it's going to go generally through a gate way and then having its traffic sent up to the cloud and then the network server that big cloud thing there is generally in the cloud doesn't have to be and there are applications where it's not but generally it's in the cloud and that is the opposite end of the communication channel the other end is the sensor so if you think of like two tin cans and a string One Tin Can is the sensor the other Tin Can is the network server the Gateway kind of sits in between and is kind of like the string right um once you've set that up you get a lot of really good benefits one of the benefits with Laura Wan is that all of the data is encrypted from the sensor until it gets to the application and that's very important for a lot of different applications right but beyond that the network level traffic is encrypted separately from your application Level traffic so that means that whoever is carrying your Laura packets from your sensor that Network cannot see what the payload is of from Those sensors that is not decrypted all the way until it gets to the application side so the great thing about that is you can rest assured that this is a completely secure architecture from end to end which is very important in many things today so awesome just to kind of zoom out here I think for I think a lot of folks on the call probably understand this but the Laura sensors are a wireless technology right it's a long range that's Laura long range and so you've got much longer reach it's similar to Wi-Fi in that it's you know decoupled from that device there's no ethernet cables but much longer range right than we're talking about with anybody who's used to Wi-Fi yeah Laura was the uh unfortunate result of letting Engineers name a technology so hello for long ra for range you know I don't know if a girlfriend was involved or not um but uh you're right it uses so gigahertz radio technology it's wireless um that's sub gigahertz radio technology just in general um is got awesome propagation characteristics right it can go really far it can generally penetrate deeply into buildings and other structures and things like that but built on top of that is the Laura modulation um and then built on top of that is the Laura Wan protocol so that stack of Technologies gives you a signal that goes really far or penetrates deep into buildings so basements and things like that car park structures they still get good signal and you get it done reliably which is one of the key things with iot right you don't want to lose contact with end devices um ever if if at all so that's part of the nice part of Laura Wan it's a stack up of Technologies from the radio frequency to the Lora Hardware to the lower wind spec it all creates a very good strong communication Channel it seems like I mean I think there's been similar Technologies in the past that have even used that same those same frequencies but I think what you're saying here it sounds like is this is really an evolved version or an evolved spin on that and there's more to it than just that that radio link there's a lot more behind their technology than maybe previous attempts had well it's based on chirp spread spectrum and sherps Spectrum was actually developed near the end of World War II uh radar so okay you imagine if you're trying to make radar and you want to be able to see something very far away right and and reliably bounce a signal off it and then be able to understand that signal when you receive it you know a lot of those requirements are very similar to what we have today with iot and lpwan and that's where chirp spread Spectrum was originally developed now the version we have today is is better definitely but this is um this is technology that has been around and proven for a long time very cool yeah just to just to give you an idea um I was messing around with some of the sensors here that I have and uh I drove around I went about a little over a half mile away from this and I was still able to get some reads I've seen in some cases where I've gone or where you've gone over a mile and you can still get some information off the sensors um some of the the local or the the co-ops the electrical co-ops they use Laura and what they can do is instead of send somebody out to manually read a meter they can jump from one meter to another meter and it could be miles away and still get that read off of it so they can save time on that so again just to give you an idea of the distance the long range that you can get it's it can be pretty far very cool okay um I think that pretty much wraps up the the architecture I did see a question that we had um on the chat I did find the chat button by the way um and that was around you know the list of devices that are are Laura capable from peplink uh right now it's on the balance 20x and there's a special uh uh Flex module mini for Laura So currently that's the only one that's available um they're going to be some others coming out there'll be an outdoor version and maybe a smaller version as well later on in the presentation I think we'll show you some of those and give you a list of that kind of stuff so but I just kind of wanted to answer that question because I saw it all right uh I think this is a good time to switch over and talk a little bit about some of the examples um with that so there we go all right so here's just you know a kind of um some of them I mean there's a lot more you can get into you know you can get into oil and gas things like that as well but you know these seems seem to be the more popular um some of the I think we can go around and talk you know each of us come up with some of them but for me smart cities I already talked about the um the Electrical Co-Op companies those they utilize stuff like that because they got to go a long ways from uh um you know neighborhood to neighborhood or meter to meter in some cases but here in Minneapolis Minnesota um Mall of America right so I they have a parking ramp they have two really big parking ramps on each side of the mall and when you drive in there there's all sorts of little sensors and stuff so you can go online you can see the parking you can see what's available what's not available um in that status and when you're driving in there you can actually get a little light too to say oh I can look down the row if it's all red I know there's no parking but if there's green that means some spaces are available so that's one big one the other one is uh um light monitoring right so you can get access to hey this light turned on this light turned off or you know you can do some control with it too so in smart cities you can change it from one color to another color so you know ideally I see stuff like on college campuses or in in major Metro areas you can turn a light from red to green like the street lights and then you can guide traffic out a certain route so that's another example of some of the lower ones I don't know Dave if you have any oh wow yeah I have tons so um Laura is uh used a lot in utility metering so water meters gas meters electric meters in fact I live in Apple Valley Minnesota and uh Apple Valley uses Laura to be able to read any meter at any time in the entire city so they never have to drive around and you know read meters or you know do any of that they just get it naturally reported the great thing is that once you have something like that in place and this is very typical of a Laura Wan use is that you get some additional capabilities so since you can read a water meter say on demand or have it report periodically you can now start doing things like Leak Detection right you can do perhaps some load balancing on the electrical side so there are a lot of things that Lauren gives you above and beyond just the raw data of what's that meter reading um another example is a smart waste we've done a lot of work with that smart waste applications generally have a sensor in a bin um and you could be checking for the bin to be full or maybe you're concerned that it's going to be empty and you need to refill it right um and that kind of data moderately interesting it's empty full right but when you couple that with other data you can create a platform and there are several out there now that will just simply tell a waste management department at a municipality say take those people that truck on that route on that day and you're done and it greatly improves the efficiency and the capability while simultaneously reducing the cost and if all that isn't good enough the biggest benefit actually is the carbon footprint reduction that's generally what the mayors of the cities are really most concerned about because if you can reduce driving these large trucks by 50 which is pretty typical of these systems you're saving a lot of carbon right so there's there's those kinds of uh of applications for the smart building you know there's there's basically two kind of sets right there's the building mechanics like the air conditioning and the air filtering and heating and things like that that you get a lot of benefits for you can do again leak detection and and all sorts of other stuff but then on the people side of buildings they're starting to realize that air quality really matters to worker productivity and health right um occupancy how a building is being used by people there's that whole side of smart building stuff and we work with large companies that have buildings all over the world and one of the nice things about Laura Wan is they can use it all over the world and they don't have to worry about uh too much about local regulations and things like that it just kind of reverse does that all make sense yeah that's that's awesome and uh you know the the last example I'll bring up is kind of a fun one uh so Dave and I we both live in uh pretty much Minneapolis Minnesota um right in the heart of Minneapolis Minnesota and uh get wireless we host a fun event at the end of the year we host a uh Ice Fishing Extravaganza we call it and we have a bunch of ice houses out on the lake and a lot of times people come to it and they're like well how cold is it out there what's it like so what we've done is we've put some temperature sensors in the ice houses so you can see what the temperature is out there and we run a contest that whoever catches the first the biggest the last whatever the you know the type of thing on the on the fish you can push a little button um kind of like a panic button but this is more of a fun way to do it that you get a fish so then we could have somebody go out there and they can measure the fish and they can do the judging and all that kind of stuff um and then on top of that we have another place off the lake for the people that won't kind of a little nervous walking on a big frozen lake well we have another facility that's on Shore where you can actually see all the information you can get the latest updates you can you know kind of go oh look somebody caught another fish a nice house five kind of a thing so it was a fun way to do you know to get the the Laura uh weigh-in technology out there and utilize it so that's the other example and if you haven't been to our get wireless ice fishing event I recommend it it's a lot of fun I think all three of us have been there past couple of years so anyway yeah actually and we also had video from outside outside temperature people didn't like to look at the value it was reporting but um and and so we were combining a bunch of different data streams too right so we were combining Laura Wan data streams but also video and the nice thing about the balance 20x is it integrated all those together and reported them back up to the cloud with no problems whatsoever um one other thing I'll mention is in the smart Healthcare there's a lot of work being done uh on the lower land side and one of these it's funny that you had concussion monitoring on there we actually had a demo uh with a football helmet on a mannequin and had people hit it with a plastic bat um to measure impact that has actually been around for a while now and so different sensors on the body are starting to become much more prevalent prevalent in professional sports getting that in kind of real time yeah not only can it do you know that kind of like the hit impact but it can also measure body temperature right because in certain cases like right now you know in the NFL they got their they got their pre-season or their pre- uh practice stuff going on where you know if they get overheated because here in Minneapolis it's 90 degrees out today and that could be if you don't have enough water or whatever but you can also uh you know fun stuff is you can detect speed how fast the person is running during a specific game and that's something that some of these sports are tracking as well it's all using the same technology that's that's cool it reminds me of another one that I've seen that's kind of my favorite so far and it's not on the healthcare side but on the agriculture side I've seen customers reaching out because they're doing this for for livestock for Agri for animals and so um whether it be cows or chicken coops there's lots of different use cases where they're trying to do similar things what you just talked about where they're tracking the vital signs of the animals trying to figure out where they are are there where they're supposed to be and just make sure that everything's moving smoothly and they're able to intervene if there is an animal that that needs Assistance or needs you know something to be yeah you know that that I'm so glad you brought that up because um I know that cattle tracking is believe it or not a big lower Wan application and one of the um kind of unique not unique really but it's one of the special things about Laura Wan is that you can track the location of an end device say a sensor without using GPS um from the lorawan signal that is received by one or more gateways they can triangulate back and with reasonable accuracy you know 20 meters um know where that device is and so uh Laura when sensors are used not only to track the health but the location of cattle in a number of places around the world um one question people may have is okay so there's lorawan and then there's the cellular Technologies ltem and nbiot right aren't they all the same and the answer is kind of um they're they're all LPN Technologies the differences between Laura Wan and say ltem are mostly um superficial I guess Laura Wan will travel farther um has greater distance and penetration than say ltem ltem has a higher bit rate so on the Laura Wan side you're going to get something from 5 to 25 kilobits per second of data throughput right that sounds really low right but if you're sending just 10 or 20 bytes it's pretty fast on the ltem side what are you going to get one to three megabits per second right so you're going to get a much greater uh data rate on ltem but for that you're going to get a much shorter battery life one of the things we haven't mentioned up until now is that Laura Wan devices are often targeted to go for five and ten years off a single battery that's very difficult for cellular devices today I'm sure they'll get there eventually not worried about that but um today in terms of battery life Lauren does tend to last longer as well so those are some compare and contrast between Laura Wen and say cellular Technologies awesome yeah thanks all right um perfect so I've seen a couple of questions come in um I think this is a good time to transition over to the device side of it um so so currently I stated this earlier so this is the balance 20x um that device has been out for a while now I think over a little over a year maybe two years I can't remember quite when the the 20x came out but uh the the module is what does the Laura weigh in connection so as you can see there it's just the the flex mini module plugs into the back of the device it does come with the antenna obviously you don't need power because it gets power off the balance 20x um and this is this is kind of a unique setup for Laura um not only can I manage my Laura network but I can also use this as well for backup primary internet or in an office location so Dave talks about this all the time where it brings it into the Laura bubble basically and you can have you know you can have both in one device and that's really unique for Laura typically your lower Gateway and we have a slide on this as well it's designed just for Laura stuff well with peplink I get both I have a you know I have two systems into one box and the best part is I can use in control 2 to set everything up right I can go into that I can you know do my configuration and then I can go into my Laura platform and configure that balance 20x into that so I'll show you how simple that is in you know on the demo side of it um this is I think it's great that we can have this now again this is the this is the first device they are working on peplink is working on an outdoor device which will um I'm not sure what the ETA is on that and then they're also working on a smaller device as well uh you know a little bit bigger than the VR1 mini maybe a more of a ubr old ubr style LTE that was out there um Dave I don't know if you have anything else to add on the on the peplink side of it or on typical sure for Laura Wan yeah absolutely so you know there are a number of different kinds of lower wind gateways out there um of different sizes different capabilities but one thing that's been pretty consistent um is that they are generally Laura Wan only gateways and some of them use an Ethernet back call some of them use a cellular back call um but that Cellular Connection from other kinds of gateways is I mean it's there and it works right but it's not as reliable as it could be sometimes right you have to do a lot of additional effort on the user's part to ensure that the Gateway doesn't drop on and off the network whereas with the peplink device that whole it back-end side of the super reliable backhaul connection over the cellular or Ethernet or bonding them together um that's all there for you so your I.T Department can just take this box they already know how to use it and configure it um and suddenly you now can offer Laura as well as Wi-Fi in your it Networks so the key part between the peplink Gateway and say other gateways is that Ultra reliability capability of the back hall connection which is often the Achilles heel in other lorawan deployments yeah I think that's a huge Point Dave because you know all of this is an end-to-end connection right you've got to get from the sensor all the way to that application server somewhere else and this is all only as good as the weakest link in the chain right so the lower Wan is really long range really reliable and that's great but cellular is still cellular right and there's it's not like it doesn't work but it's not as easy as people think it is sometimes and anybody who's deployed hundreds or thousands of cellular devices can understand what the day-to-day operations that look like and that's really where we value add here is that we've been doing that for years that stuff's airtight and then we've got the speed Fusion technology to add that reliability so if you've got things like starlink or other connection types in play it all works it's already been proven it's all it's all right there to be used um I think the other thing that's really big is all of all these devices have esim capability and so um you know you said there's global companies doing this well you know how do I get a SIM card for 15 different countries well taplings got one built in right it's built in right in the product you don't have to put a SIM card in it even you just put some antennas on it and you can activate that esim right over the air and so you don't have to use that built-in connectivity but again when you're trying to stand this up globally there's a lot of barriers that suddenly show up and trying to negotiate contracts and 5 10 15 different countries with cell carriers that's not a that's not a quick process and so there's a lot of things that we really make a lot easier that maybe aren't obvious or upfront to somebody who hasn't really tried to do this at scale yet but these are all stumbling points that people run into out you know technical and non-technical yes and and in addition to that the peplink platform allows you greater internal operational efficiencies in many lorawan Network deployments those are done separately from it they have an OT operational technology team right and they're running this network are they are they really skilled at it is this their their uh their expertise it maybe or maybe not most often it's not um because there's ongoing management and and efficiency gains to be made well after the networks are deployed it's just an ongoing effort and so what you really want is to have your I.T staff who can manage and maintain your network for you so you don't have to worry about that you don't have to have a separate staff that's going to be running back and forth with it asking them about their ethernet connection or their Cellular Connection so one of the great things about the way peplink did this is to fully integrate this into your IAT solution house so that you don't need the extra staff you don't need the extra steps in deployment and it's more reliable as a result awesome um I think this should you know I think at this point I don't know how you guys feel about it but I can get into a demo I mean we've been chatting a little bit about you know this whole setup for the past 30 minutes now if you want I can definitely jump into the demo I do see we have a bunch of questions coming in so maybe the demo will help answer some of those but we can take those afterwards as well all right um I think great let's see it perfect okay so I'm gonna bring this over here is uh here's my in control 2 account um and you can see I have this balance 20x here with Laura um I'm just going to click on it right now and in here once I show all I can you can see the the flex module that's plugged in um you can see how I'm connected this isn't connected via cellular it's just Wireline but you can see all the information I'm going to remote into the device and go to the dashboard um once I get into here this is where I can start enabling some of the stuff so the Laura side is under the advanced tab and then I got my lorewen configuration so it's a pretty simple setup right you know the first thing is I would just enable it and this opens up all the controls out here and then I can select my protocol whether it's um pack code forwarder UDP packet folder or basic station in this example I'm using the packet forwarder and then I can choose my frequency plan uh peplink sets it up for band one or for band two but in this case I'm using band one and if I know that I can easily switch it between the different bands so this is eight different bands and then I have my server that I'm going to connect to and then the port that I can I'm gonna need the other thing that's really important is this network mode right so is it going to be a private network mode or public and again in this example I'm using public network mode um this eui is important because this is what talks to the sensors or talks to my application server so this is uh this is you know something that you definitely need to know because I'll plug this into the the system that we're using and in this example I'm using the platform from Radio bridge and I have a dashboard right here and as you can see I have a publink demo So currently I have a couple of sensors set up I'm actually going to set up a whole nother sensor for us today but you can see that I hooked up a temperature one so you can see roughly about this is about 72 degrees it ranges anywhere from this was overnight so anywhere from about 68 65 up to about 72 degrees and you can see the humidity I went outside yesterday with it so you can see the humidity and the temperature increase and the humidity change actually here's a big one right here where it got really humid but good information on this and then um down below this little graph right here this is like a a door so if a door opens It's actually an accelerometer so if the door moves uh you can see that so you can see that it's been I've had 20 instances where the door opened and really what I do is I just kind of shake the accelerometer just to simulate a door um so that's kind of the dashboard side of it when I come into the gateway you can see I have this balance 20x right here again so here's that eui information that I needed to put it in there I got to tell it a zone that I'm in and the kind of bridge that I'm using so again I'm using chirp stack but I'm using radio bridge for this scenario and then you know is it active or not um going back in there so once I got my device configured I can come back to this and I can go to the status side of it under the event log I can actually get all my information so I can see that it it started connecting and then it actually connected so this is more of a confirmation thing that I get when I'm actually setting up my device for the first time and then you can see I also get some alerts in here as well all right so back to this uh so now that I have my device set up it's actually going into the into the sensors so this is kind of a I'll do this one for you so I I can configure the device I can give it kind of a protocol or how I want it to configure like how I want to be notified of stuff if I want to get you know information or a message in here so to give you an example I can take this see I just picked up this door sensor and I can see that it went off already that little flash of yellow so that it started um I can do it again you can see I get another started indicator from here um pretty neat information you can see the Gateway that I'm configured so here's that eui information again you can see the hardware some some battery voltage and then the last scene so this is some good information that's on there if I go back to the devices here's my temperature and humidity one um this is kind of a weird test but I'll show you anyway so I have it set up right now um that you know if I want a notification if it gets warmer than a certain amount to let me know so if I go blow on it you'll see I'll get a couple of alerts just that it's getting warmer there we go now it's up to 24.5 degrees Celsius so kind of some neat information and again if I go back to the dashboard um I can create a separate peplink dashboard in there and I can see that information over here on the right that it's getting a little warmer so you can see the time stamp and all that information so that's just kind of the basic setup and you know how you can see some of the information on the on one of the platforms that's out there but let's set up a device currently so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a device I'm going to pick the network again so here I'm using chirpstack I'm actually going to use the certain information off this so I'm going to call this pep link button uh this is my device information okay the key um this app key it's interesting it's not quite as long as a peplink license but it's very similar yeah so while he's doing that I'll explain uh I talked about how uh things were encrypted from end to end right from the sensor all the way to the application so a sensor has two key and critical pieces of information it's universally unique identifier it's called a Devi UI and then it has a root key and from the root key a whole bunch of different session keys are derived for those of you who understand computer security a bunch of session keys are derived and used for different very specific purposes and one of them is to encrypt the payload and to encrypt Network traffic and things like that so that's why he has to enter in that information because the Devi UI is a unique number the key is not necessarily unique but it's a secret so those two are key and critical to knowing what a device is and how it works awesome Okay so this is the information the only other one was the selected region so this is the US um so I got EU and the U.S region so I'm just going to use that uh obviously because I'm in the US but once I got this in here I can hit continue I'm getting a little get a little confirmation page up here Maybe love live demos all right hang on well I've never seen that I know I wonder if it's because I just removed the device yesterday let me see what happens when I refresh the page you go in there nope I'll have to do it all over again sorry for the duplication it's a good thing I don't have to do uh each character individually there we go oh that was weird um so I get my confirmation page make sure everything looks right once I confirm it I can view the device and then over here is where I can set up a configuration so this was the last one I used I'm just going to copy it that's why it's up here is it that you know I I could change it so I can have a little light enable the button press or I can enable it when it was released for example if I had to hold it for a certain amount of time I could do that get notification on that as well but once I set up my configuration the ones I want I hit submit and down here on this setup I can actually see when the configuration was sent and then you can also get an alert back when it was received so it might take a second or two for it to be received but again I'll get a little message indication up here of the status there we go so there's my uh there's a first button push so every time I get a button push you can kind of see that so I keep pushing it so it's pretty simple to add kind of the sensors and then if I go back to my dashboard and again you can see all the information I can see a battery voltage I can't see that yet but you can see the button pushes are coming in from my dashboard um you can see there might be another one might have to add the screen but I could add the button push in here if I really wanted to up on top so anyway I can add it right from here to my line chart select my device so you can see all the different buttons that I've had so yesterday we had 26 times and today so far we got the three times but again kind of a graphical information on on the information that you have whether it's a button push door open door close or even a temperature side of it yeah let's see did I get any text um so far I haven't gotten I don't know if the notifications turned off let me make sure that was turned on uh peplink demo temp demo button demo so this was turned off when I deleted the device but really what I'm doing right here is I am getting a text or an email every time the button is pushed so this is what we utilized in that uh ice house or ice fishing demonstration so when the button was pushed and it went off um we got a text message to whoever let's see if I can get one to come in real quick we'll do a couple go back into the demo there's a couple I mean oh so here we go I'll try to do this pretty good but you can see I'm getting a bunch of text messages already and I'm also getting some emails coming in so this is a good way to flood my email um but yeah you can get information that it tells you the nice thing is it tells you the information like the RSSI so if I was traveling far away I can see how a week of a signal I'm getting so I know I'm on the edge of that um that uh reception Point kind of a thing so yeah but you can yeah again notifications are really simple I can create a new one I can add it uh the notification name the type um it's going to be a single device type obviously and then I pick the button I want and then I have certain triggers and rules and again each each system so this is how radio Bridge works but all sorts of other applications might have different setups but just to give you an idea on how to configure it it's pretty simple and it's it in some cases it's easy to configure but anyway that was the demo perfect all right so I see we have about 15 questions Trev Travis do you want to start asking some of those see which ones we don't have I think the first one's an interesting one but I don't know that we have an official answer yet will the lorawan flex module be Amazon's sidewalk compliant in the future making use of the sidewalk Network for extended range um you know I know we've definitely been looking at projects like that um Dave I don't know you know I again I can't officially say yes or no it won't will or won't be but it's definitely an intriguing one um Dave what do you know about I can I can talk to that uh you know peplink is a member of the Laura Alliance get wireless is a member of the lore Alliance in fact I'm one of the original authors of the Laura Wan spec and I currently am chairperson of the certification committee and so I can tell you that within the alliance we are working to harmonize Laura Wan with sidewalk and so probably not until perhaps early 2024 because it's being worked on now um there will be some way to have devices that speak Lauren and sidewalk kind of interoperate so that's definitely coming it will probably be a very very simple thing to support so I don't doubt that in the future if I came to pep link and said you need to make this slight tweak and now you can talk sidewalk that they wouldn't do that but I can't commit for you Travis right but the alliance is working on harmonizing these things and eventually it'll be part of the standard spec that's awesome yeah that I mean I think that pretty much answers the question but again we've got to see it actually take shape to comment on that but yeah I if the industry is moving that way it's highly unlikely we would not um cool so we've got that one um how do you mitigate bandwidth issues since Laura is on is using unlicensed frequency so I'm guessing they're talking about like congestion um things like that oh sure okay so um I'll try not to make it too complicated but you'll have my email and I am happy to go as deep as you want uh on the technology side but basically the way the signal is modulated um you can actually have up to five or six devices at the exact same time at the exact same frequency all talking simultaneously and receive all five or six of those things and that's because there's a a thing called a spreading factor that goes into the modulation of the signal and so you have spreading factors that I think some of the Semtech devices go down as low as five and it goes up to 12. now in the United States we can't go to 12 we stop but I think around 10 and that's due to FCC regulations on regarding time on air but what these spreading factors do do is allow you to spreading Factor seven eight nine ten you can send a signal on the same frequency at the same time and they will not interfere with each other it's kind of like um if you've ever seen a prism right and you hold a prism up and you know you're surrounded by light and when you use the prism you see it breaks it into blue green red orange light and the light is all existing in the same spot at the same time and not interfering with each other right well it's similar concept with Laura that way if I could put it like that great device densities so you don't generally have to worry about that sure and that's very different than how say Wi-Fi operates as a protocol oh yeah not allow that kind of same kind of feature or capability but yes Wi-Fi you know you're sharing right it's my turn it's your turn it's my turn it's your turn whereas with Laura you all just talk uh at the same time in fact um very briefly uh a Laura and point has three different ways to operate Class A B and C and it has nothing to do with the alphabet a stands for all it's base functionality all lorawan devices need to implement that and that is basically a device sleeps and whenever it decides to wake up it talks it doesn't do csmacd it just wakes up and it talks and the gateways will hear it Class B is with a beacon that gives you reduced latency from the network on a beacon period basis so that a device can wake up periodically to see if the network wants to talk to it and then the class C is continuously listening to be talked to by the network each one has different Power profiles most devices are class A but that we base the whole operation of Class A devices on the fact that there really aren't any issues with getting onto the Spectrum from other devices in the United States very cool another question here would Laura win or ble be better for tracking specific location over a large area I'm going to throw this back to you Dave because I can't compare the two technologies with intelligence so sure um so first of all we are get wireless is device agnostic right we do a lot of stuff with Laura Wan we do a lot of stuff with cellular and Bluetooth and NFC and a lot of others Wi-Fi um it it depends generally if you're going to track over a wide area so an example is in South Africa they they do cattle tracking and so they have set up gateways um that kind of surround a an area within which they're going to have cattle roaming around and this area is miles on a side it's a very large area well in that kind of situation with a little tag on the ear of the of the cow um Laura would be best for that right and for that you're going to get you know 20 meter 17 meter accuracy which for a cow is pretty good right I mean cows are large if you're within 17 meters you're gonna probably see the cow now if you're talking about a very large Warehouse right and you need to have much finer granularity on your location well then you probably want to use a Bluetooth solution right um some people might even say Ultra wide band in that case you're going to have to put up an awful lot of Bluetooth beacons right but generally in something like a warehouse you need much greater granularity on your location so Bluetooth might be better for that makes sense so it sounds like there's a fairly natural trade-off between the range and the Precision I guess yeah so basically you want to choose the technology that gives you the the location Precision that you're looking for right um and in this case you know Bluetooth is good for much finer precision okay so I think this was covered in a little bit earlier but I think it's good to review here as well um is the pepboy and flex module a base station and or a Gateway in the architecture shown so the pep link balance 20x with the flex module would be the quote base station slash Gateway okay so it's kind of combining that that radio and that um so you'll have a sensor it'll talk directly to the balance 20x and then that will go directly to the cloud uh wherever you're running your network server okay can anyone connect to your Lauren Gateway I think this stems back to that public private mode that we saw in the demo setup yeah so the whole concept of of Laura Wan gateways believe it or not came from IBM and they um kind of took what we call a Highlander approach there can be only one right and and they envisioned that every antenna of every Laura Gateway would be like one virtual antenna worldwide very IBM kind of idea right but that's the way it kind of works Laura gateways will receive packets from Laura devices and then the lorawan protocol will determine whether that is forwarded and because we do support roaming and Laura Wan right so the whole idea of a neutral host is is fully supported so it will either forward a packet or not depending upon how you want to uh disposal dispose of those things so um the answer is kind of yes and no but most Laura gateways will receive all Laura traffic cool uh is there a Lauren Gateway device that I can plug into a balanced 310x there's no pep link provided Laura Wan solution for the 310x right now it's that balanced 20x is the the current model in the lineup that supports that here's the I know the next question is going to be the outdoor one um here's the here's kind of a an example of what the outdoor will look like this will probably be the next lorawan gateway to come out so it is IP67 rating rated um and it's an all-en closure to it uh don't you could probably I'm not sure if we have a data sheet yet for it but um yes there is a device coming for this and then on the br1 mini side we're all they're also looking at a smaller version it's not going to be more of a br1 mini might be a little bit bigger than that might be a little bit different form factor more around that ubr LTE so kind of like a little bit bigger form factor but yes there are multiple devices that peplink is looking at on on for the lore it's just the the fastest to deployment was the balance 20x with the flex module and then I'll launch more as we go I think we basically just knocked off two questions there yep I'm not sure on the ETA for the for the outdoor one um I I would think in the next next quarter depending on certifications three or four minutes left here so a lot of questions just about recommendations for third-party servers to use um I don't know if we I don't know if you have recommendations or just more or less a list of um I do I I absolutely we we work with all of them and so uh you will be providing our email addresses right as part of this I'm I'm happy if you want to email me I am happy to talk and give you recommendations on that there are some really good ones out there and it depends on you know where you're going to put your network right in different parts of the world what you're going to be doing so um there are quite a number of them and we'd be happy to recommend the right ones for you I see a question on how much additional Wan data volume is generated between the Gateway and the network server um I know the answer is not a lot but that's not a specific or precise answer so you know there's the answer that applies today and then in the alliance we're actually working on the network server to Gateway interface specification um and so today there's different pieces of software I think you saw on the demo that Mike showed you they have a thing called the UDP packet forwarder that's the original Laura just moving packets back and forth kind of Gateway software and then there was this other one you might have seen that said basic station that's a little more advanced that incorporates some more kind of device management level sorts of capabilities well the lower Alliance has never defined that specifically and so we will be releasing a network server to Gateway interface specification and that's going to be probably about the end of the year and we will also be releasing from the certification group certification test Suites so you can certify that's your gateway follows that spec um so in the future you're going to have a little bit different than what you have today but as Travis said overall the additional data from the Gateway that's generated by the Gateway are sent just to the Gateway is relatively small it's mostly metadata about gateways configuration operation capabilities and so forth and state um probably a few K bytes that's sent you know every hour something like that it's not a lot all right well I think that wraps us up just perfectly here I know there's a couple more questions out there but um feel free to reach out we will continue this discussion and really that's the whole point of this webinar is to get the discussion started any folks that are interested in deploying this technology we've got devices and we've got experts here that know how to do this so definitely reach out and thank you so much for joining us everyone thank you Dave thank you Mike much appreciated to have your expertise on this and looking forward to see what people can do with this yeah thanks for having us yeah thanks everybody all right take care folks goodbye goodbye tip"}

Travis Derek product manager here at peplink and as always we are joined by Peter West Professor p and Peter you've got some outbound policy stuff for us today I'm I'm excited about this one I am very excited about this one um I think you know especially a speed Fusion connect is taking more and more uh popularity the ability to control the flow of traffic is is important and I think that this is going to help people understand how we control that that flow over different internet connections especially when dealing with like things like Netflix and things like that and how we handle that so awesome well let's dive in let's do it thank you everybody for joining and um like I said today we're going to talk about outbound policies and um there are um outbound policies are are basically if depending on how you how you word it are you going to be traffic shaping in a sense we're telling the traffic on your land how do you use the different internet connections what Cellular Connections or Wi-Fi Wan or starlink or bonded internet like speed Fusion connect or just regular speed Fusion going to like your corporate office and and how we control the flow of traffic and what that means and so um outbound policies can be managed in three different ways we can manage it right inside the ssf SMC protect um kind of portal management interface which allows for really simplistic um policy management uh specifically designed around which applications we want to send over speed Fusion connect or we can manage it right inside the router like on the GUI and and so and that's going to we're going to have to show you how to do that and then we have inside inside in control and so the idea is using in control 2 with SAS and Regional applicate capabilities as well as group policies and then centralized management so if you have a bunch of routers you've got to manage and control two brings all that together yeah I think for me outbound policies was kind of like almost like a light bulb moment for me you know if I look back to when I first started using peplink I mean it was a long time ago now but most routers then had one port for an internet connection right so there was no such thing as an outbound policy but as soon as you have more than one internet connection there's different places that you can send your traffic there's different strategies for using those two and there's different reasons for doing the you know implementing those strategies but you know then when you enter speed Fusion you've got two individual connections but then you've got this like super bonded connection that is your speed Fusion tunnel so again you need this ability to kind of steer traffic in different ways and and be able to take advantage of all those connections to the best that they can do and there's pros and cons to each one I mean there's there's there's limitations the speech Fusion has overhead to it there there is a you know a native overhead Associated speed Fusion where if someone's looking for raw bandwidth and they have a gigabit connection you might not want to have your regular internet traffic bonded or or accidentally going out a slower connection unless that that faster connection fails and so we have algorithms designed to basically fit almost any scenario uh and we'll review those different algorithms uh here in the presentation and then I'm going to demonstrate them in real time on I've got a uh a laptop uh an IP camera an hd4 mbx 5G and then two adg antennas um connected to my hd45g and so I've got uh two ATT T-Mobile and a Verizon setup um and then we're gonna we're gonna play around with with uh with the bonding there yeah I think you mentioned something that I think is kind of interesting and it it depends on kind of who you are or what perspective you're coming at this from but um for somebody who's coming into this conversation from like an Enterprise networking world where they're used to what what's called often sd-wan Solutions you don't always get a lot of these choices it's kind of like something's done in the background and and you don't really have control everything is tunneled everything is sent through this sd-wan pipe and with peplink you've got full control you've got the ability like you said some things I just want to send right out my Comcast I don't need to send my web browsing to a bonded connection so yeah I'll let you keep going here but I just love that you've pointed that out right away thank you and another I built on that sorry you know we kind of like go back and forth and feed each other a lot but I mentioned traffic shaping earlier and a lot of times when I'm dealing with the um with Enterprise specific like people are really into the large Enterprise Networks it's all routing so like where's my default route what's my route priority where's my bgp handoff and they're thinking negotiating with their ISP or the mpls circuits and they're thinking about how do I route this traffic and we're not routing the traffic we're shaping the traffic we're sd-wan or peplink or supercharged connectivity we're telling this we're telling the router how I want that traffic to be handled um and and so we're not routing the traffic with weights where we're actually controlling the flow of traffic on a bunch of different options like TCP and UDP IP dscp Source IP address destination IP address destination URL destination SAS application Google or Microsoft teams and so we're able to control how your internet is being is using or how your network is using your internet connections um and so it's a lot more powerful than just routing the traffic up to the next internet um yeah or ISP and so so routing distributed routing slash traffic shaping in peplink equals outbound policy management um and so it makes a big deal on how we handle that and I think the other nice thing is if you know if you're coming at this from maybe the other end of the spectrum where you know Enterprise networking is not your world it's not it's not what you do um the album policy manager looks just like a firewall and so it works very similarly so if you've ever had to set up a firewall rule this is going to start to kind of make sense quickly I think as you step through it so yeah there's something for everybody here to learn as usual with with the public university and um and kind of feeding off that too is outbound policies like firewall rules work top down and so it's going to check on the very top and if you've seen this gray bar right here which is really neat that peplink did this in the creation of the slides the first rule is this gray bar and that actually is a rule it's saying hey follow pep VPN ospf bgp rip V2 and speed Fusion Cloud routes in other words if I know the destination via standard routing protocols that are available to me use that first then follow these policies so it's kind of a default route optimization in a sense and and but what's really cool is too is you can actually drag your rules above so a lot of times for example someone have a default route zero zero zero goes into their core network but for out-of-band management I want to say if peplink.com go out the go out speedfusion connect so I'll actually say I'll move speed Fusion template the destination peplink.com above default routes in other words overriding the default zero zero zero route that might be going into a core Network um and saying Hey I want to make sure out-of-band management is not being affected by a core Uplink it's taking advantage of these multiple circuits very cool um yeah accessing uh outbound policies and in control too is really easy under your end control and two environment you're going to go to uh network settings and outbound policies um and it's important here too is outbound policies on the router can work by grouped networks and access Access Control lists um as well as Source IP address Source Network destination IP address destination Network destination group to network um and so you can centrally manage these grouped networks and access control lists and in control and I love this feature and I've been showing it off a lot for enhanced security but like for example say you have a group of servers in your corporate Network and so you can create a grouped Network called servers and you can list those servers then you can create an access control list which are Mac addresses of your your company laptops your company PCS or whatever and then in your firewall rules you can create if the source is my Access Control list authorized PCS and the destination is my group network servers allow that traffic anybody else destination to those servers deny the same type of thing applies to outbound policies I can say if the source are these devices and the destination is these servers or this destination group of ips send it over speed Fusion send it over Wan smoothing send it over um you know hot failover make sure these connections stay priority and so you can use outbound policies not to to enhance the reliability of those specific connections just like you can use firewall policies to secure those connections and so they all apply um equally and it's it's really it's really neat that peplink has thought about that and put it right uh Forefront in the in the UI and then centralize that in in control which means if you have 500 sites you create one policy and they all follow that policy if you need to add a new Mac address it doesn't matter where that user is in the environment you just add it to the access control list and now they have access to that Network um so it's it's kind of a really thing that peplink has done with these grouped networks and access control lists yeah just really you know levels up the integration possibilities there and I think you're going to jump into some even more ones here but yeah exactly and and so in inside in control peplink now has the ability to do um SAS based um outbound policies so if if I if I know I want to make sure if I'm using teams all the time I can say hey if if the destination is teams I want you to use um uh land smoothing or I want you to use um Dynamic bonding or whatever whatever it might be um to make sure that those connections are reliable it doesn't matter what the destination IP address is it doesn't matter where the country is it doesn't matter what the source is it doesn't matter if it's someone's phone and they're they're hopping on the Wi-Fi network or it's a conference room excuse me if if the destination is teens bond that traffic make sure it's protected make sure it's resilient um or if man if you've got a 10 gig fiber line at your office you go speed Fusion is great but we have a 10 gig fiber line I want to prioritize that traffic over over that 10 gig and then only if that 10 gig fails go over to speedfusion connect to Bonded 5G then you can say hey priorities uh this 10 gig fiber line backup hot failover or failover to speed Fusion connect protect with dual 5G and my sdx now I'm using this 10 gig fiber line this super low latency connection for most of my traffic and then only in that fails I failure and that's actually what I do in my office so I have six gigs of fiber here it's like two milliseconds of latency so I'm not gonna Bond and add extra latency when I have dual six gig fibers in my office um I'm gonna I'm gonna fail over to that because the likelihood of a fiber failure is limited and so I'm optimizing the flow of my traffic based on on a situation that might or might happen but not not gonna happen often um whereas if I had a cable modem or a DSL modem or maybe I was running solely on starlink and 5G I want to aggregate those trap that traffic all the time I want to say hey always Bond my team's traffic because the the cellular network or the Starling Network can be variable and I want to make sure that if even though the variable I'm getting that consistent reliability with with uh the team's call and so I can I can shape that over over speed Fusion connect we have eight outbound policy algorithms to make sure that um that the traffic is is operating how you want it to operate and it will I say this a lot and I get I you people probably make fun of me for it but it's why I love pep link they're not like hey here's an outbound policy send the traffic over like there's a lot of reasons why you might want to use one internet over another internet or one tunnel over another tunnel or one destination over another destination and so like let's make sure we we give people options and and it's it's like this the ability to control and power like control your network to suit your application or your mission um and peplink does this with these eight load balancing algorithms soon to be nine um and and so we have weighted balance um weighted balance is it can be very confusing for people and it's actually kind of like the standard if you're if you're involved in routing if you're an Enterprise engineer you're playing around with Cisco's you're very familiar with weighted balance almost every route every ospf uh thing that you set up or bgp you can assign a weight to that to that route which gives it kind of like an inherent priority but it's really the distribution mechanism if if I have two winds and each of them are weight 10. every other packet's going to get every other session is going to get load bounced over them appropriate and if I say this wrong uh uh Travis please correct me but every other session is going to get load load balance so session one is going to go over Wan one session two is going to go over win two session three is going to go over land one session four is going to go over land two they're equal weights so every new session is going to get load balanced equally that's really good if you have two fiber lines two cable modems you have two 5G modems and you want to just make sure you're maximizing session like session distribution um to to take advantage of those uh uh the maximum throughput of each circuit uh and you and they're they're kind of equal uh services that you're load bouncing against persistence comes into play when you're when you're talking about more SSL traffic right when you're saying hey I need to make sure as soon as a session is established all traffic going to that destination for the duration of that session stays there because you don't want to have the IP address changing during an SSL transaction with your bank or with teams or any kind of SSL traffic that's IP uh persistent requirement and so persistence says once you establish a connection on Wan one stay there until that session is terminated um and so so persistence is really good for creating reliable SSL Cape sessions over multiple lands and and that that is important especially when you're when you're looking at everything going SSL these days making sure that those sessions stay resilient now I've seen some some Cloud applications are getting better at handling that uh like you can do a uh you like you can it's almost like you don't always need that but there are there are applications where I've seen that you'll still like you'll drop that I'm at that that FaceTime call or something like that and you're like ah why am I dropping that call and it's because because it's not persistent so you have some overhead rule that's flip-flopping your Wayans and so FaceTime is renegotiating and so it's connecting then renegotiating connecting and and that's what's happening that that call is being renegotiated as as the sessions move um and so possession persistence allows you to force that traffic out the same way and once that session is established forced enforce says I want you to always use this internet connection whatever it is and re whether it's up or down and four says always use it this is good for ah this is good for um um where you have like particular like a white list or you have a a need we've used this for um like Windows updates hey Windows updates go over my fiber line I don't want Windows updates going out my my 5G right like certain applications Netflix or YouTube or or uh you know Windows updates or things like that I want you to always go over my ethernet Wan that's not costing me money if that win fails it's just not going to work until that win comes back up 5G I mean your regular internet traffic will work but the other traffic won't um and so enforced is a great way of making sure certain traffic can't fail over to a maybe a more expensive line another time another really neat use case for enforced is like guest networks um if you have a guest Network and you have the cable modem or a fiber line or starlink or whatever and um you know those those traffic are fast and then you're failing over to like a 5G or a more expensive um satellite like an SES or something like that you might want your guest Network to only use that cheaper internet and so you can say if the source is my guest Wi-Fi um VLAN go out this internet connection if if that connection fails my guests lose internet I can still operate over the more expensive internet but the guest Network fails and so the enforcer is a really good way to make sure they don't accidentally use your more expensive line um priorities one of my favorites in combination with uh probably late uh lowest latency or fast response time but priority says Hey use this circuit then use this circuit then use this circuit and the only way it's going to fail over is if this top circuit fails and this is great if you're running speed Fusion which I always run speed Fusion so it I like priority um it's basically saying hey use speed Fusion connect Atlanta then use speed Fusion connect Dallas then use maybe my my Fusion Hub up in Azure because the fusion up in Azure costs me money right I have to pay for that bandwidth um that's going to Azure but speed Fusion can act peplink's hosting it so it's their data so um so I can I can send my my traffic out speed Fusion Atlanta then go to my more expensive speed Fusion azure and and still maintaining reliability and and because speed Fusion connect is so reliable most of times like that that's not really going to be you're not gonna be flip-flopping between those circuits it's in the event that there's some sort of data center outage there hey fail over to my my my backup speed Fusion solution um another good example of priority is starlink and 5G you starlink then fail over to 5G or use um my Ethernet or my cable modem then fail over to starlink and so you're basically saying use this better this this preferred connection then fail over and all of this space can be based on source and destination you don't have to do this to everything so you're not saying all traffic you're saying the source and destination and protocol that I choose my team's calls or SSL or if the destination is netflix.com or whatever or my sources my guest Network so you can control this and then and then you can apply these policies individually based on that source and destination um and in my my video here or My Demo I've got an IP camera and so I'm going to show you how I make sure that the IP camera network is secure or is protected with speed Fusion connect um and and so it's reliable as it streams to YouTube um so that's priority it's good it's going to use that first one then fail over to the next one then fail over to the next one and it's only going to fail over if that connection fails and and so it's not going to be using any sort of algorithm to say hey is this the best connection it's this connection then this connection um over the flow oh got it one thing that I see a lot is that priority and force get used often kind of interchangeably and you know oftentimes enforce gets used when maybe priority was a better choice because enforced is absolute right it is that connection or it dies and so there's some gotchas that you kind of have to keep in mind here because yeah I really do want it to use this connection but if it's a traffic that I do want to fail over you know you have to make sure that you actually account for that failover in there yeah you need to understand that one if with enforced if that connection that's being enforced goes down there is no it's not going to fail over their backup or or do anything else this is always going to use that circuit one of my favorite things to do is priority but on one land because rules work top down I'll say priority speed Fusion connect nothing else then there's a check box that says fail to the next rule so if speed Fusion goes down do the next thing what's the next thing I wanted to do maybe use Bond its circuits or maybe go somewhere else or but but my priority is here and priority has that check box that says if if that one Connection in my list is down go to the next Rule and remember rules were top down and so you can kind of get creative you don't have to fit yourself to a box of that one rule you can say I wanted to use speed Fusion connect but if it doesn't I don't want to go to the next one I don't want to go to one Cellular Connection I want to go back to load balancing just just load balance across those connections because if you just said priority uh speed Fusion connect then cell one and cell two then cell three then sell four well then what's gonna happen if if speed Fusion connect goes down then everything's going to use cell one and nothing will use cell two three and four so you can say use prior speed Fusion connect nothing else then if that fails go to just a normal load balancing just just share the traffic across cell one through four and that way you're taking the most advantage of all the circuits you have yeah and then you know basically you're getting the ability to harness the power of multiple algorithms then right you're not boxed into oh I picked this one so I have to do it this way exactly yeah you can go to lowest latency or fastest response time or something else better yeah um overflow is almost exactly as it sounds it this this one fills up and then it goes to this one and that one fills up and then it goes to that one um I've never used this successfully um Travis do you have a use case where overflow has been used this kind of opens a little bit of a can of worms but there are some other algorithms within speed Fusion as well and so I've seen this used much more um strategically inside of speed Fusion where you know it's also and I think it maybe should be labeled bursting inside of speed Fusion because um you know if you've got like a slow DSL like that's you're not paying per gig right there's no meter on it usually but it's just like 10 Megs and it's great when it's you know when you're not maxing it out but then when you are maxing it out it's worthless right so you know overflow is to kind of like break beyond that 10 Meg DSL and then you know strategically use my 5G connection that I'm maybe paying per gig on right so I'm not always using that 5G connection but when I need the speed it's there but um in practice I see that work much more effectively within the speed Fusion so once it needs more than 10 Megs so anything under 10 megabits per second you're just like using that DSL it's nice and cheap keep it's free but once your router needs more than 10 megabits it overflows into the 5G giving you more throughput exactly yep that's a great use case it really is uh and and once again it's one of those things you only know what you know um and and you know it's the use cases that you're trying to solve but that's a really neat use case yeah um least used is um is a really interesting one what what it does is every new session the route the router knows you can program the router with the throughput available for each of your circuits so um this is a 20 Megs of download with a five Megs of op this is a 100 Meg download with a 10 up um and so what least use does is it says based on the download bandwidth that that's being consumed use the internet connection that has the least download usage of all of them so if I have four internet connections and internet and cell one is is using about 13 Megs of download and cell 2 is using 12 and a half Megs of download and cell three is using 14 Megs of download and sell fours using five Megs the next session is going to start on by on on on four because it only has five Max usage and then if I start streaming Netflix on that and goes to 26 Megs well now cell 2 which has 12 and a half mags is going to be the next lowest used and so what it's doing is every new session that is created is is based on the current utilization uh the downlink utilization of those circuits um and it's really nice for optimizing variable internet circuits it's making sure you're always kind of using the connections being used at least um and it doesn't have a lot of overhead so lowest latency and fast response time have more overhead Associated to them least used gives you that kind of capability without adding overhead um to the WAN circuits um lowest latency and fastest response time are very similar slightly confusing confusing lowest latency is a lower overhead version of fastest response time so the idea of Lewis latency is to make sure that that the connections that are being established are connecting over the lowest latency Connection in other words it's going to be the fastest response time because lowest latency um but it does it based on three hops so the router parity periodically checks the latency out to three hops out and says which internet connection is has the lowest latency to those tests third hop the fourth hop might not be as fast as the fourth hop of the next of the other internet connection we're checking to the third hop so it costs you less than fastest response time and so any new traffic will go out the lowest latency session connection to that third hop fastest response time every new session sends out an syn on all all available internet connections being calculated in the fastest response time the first one to receive an ack that is the one the established that the session is established on all other acks get with withdraw or get dropped do not do this if you have multiple starlings you'll get a either shut down or you get a call from starlink saying you're flooding our Network just FYI don't use faster response time with starlink um if you have two star links and you're trying to use the fastest one um you you want to use uh least used um because starlink is sharing up on the hubs so so on on a least used you're gonna you're gonna be a more reliable connection um fast lowest latency fast response time and ping based type of sessions they flood that Network and it creates a a lot of messy um traffic for them um so stay away from lowest latency and fast response time when you're dealing with starlink um in speed Fusion uh in speed Fusion connector and speed Fusion we have uh you can create multiple profiles and we talk about this and I'm not going to dig too much into it um on this because we probably should have a dedicated speed Fusion conversation um but the idea is you can create multiple profiles or multiple ways to use your internet connection so you could you can say hey use Dynamic bonding bonding basically says take take the maximum of available internet that's a that's across my circuits combine them together and give me the most internet possible Wayne smoothing says send parity bits in other words if if anybody watching this is familiar with like the old raid arrays for hard drives right you take three hard drives and you raid them so you have the capacity of two and that third one becomes almost like a parity drive and so the data is being split across those three drives when smoothing is very similar to that Wayne smoothing says hey make sure that my connections are being uh my packets being sent across these three circuits are redundant so if packet gets dropped on circuit one search at two and three are carrying that that the load of that other packet and so we're having resiliency there um and so what that does is it lowers latency and it lowers it decreases Jitter because if if the the packets being transmitted and then this internet connection spikes up to 1300 milliseconds well the other two packets arrive it just discards that 1300 millisecond session whereas bonding you're limited your your latency will be the lowest the highest latency connection so if I have three connections and it's 30 milliseconds 40 milliseconds and 100 milliseconds bonding I'm 100 milliseconds when smoothing might it would be 40 milliseconds that hundred would just be discarded um and so so when smoothing costs you data in exchange for lower latency and or increased resiliency and so teams and video calls YouTube streams when smoothing is really nice if you're in unknown networks 5G starlink DSL cable modems they can Spike you can be at 13 milliseconds and then shoot up to 1300 milliseconds just because there's congestion on the network or someone starts a download and it exceeds your throughput capabilities and so when smoothing helps ensure reliable connectivity no matter like kind of taking those those spikes into into account yeah I think unwind smoothing a lot of people I think that come from traditional networking worlds they get really hung up on this because they they look at that and they say well you know can't you just cue that better can't you just do you know where's the qos here well qos on non-guaranteed links doesn't guarantee you anything right that doesn't actually achieve much because the networks super variable so I can keep all day and if the if the packets are getting dropped I'm queuing for nothing right I'm not actually solving my problem and so when smoothing is like Brute Force qos right we're gonna we don't trust any one of these links we're gonna use them both all the time every time and certain types of traffic that's that's super valuable and useful and you can justify that overhead not all you know not going to do that for your Facebook traffic but um for this call yeah I'm doing that definitely ditto yeah I mean the idea is to make sure that that connection is resilient um and so that that's the idea behind it I think one one thing too that I want to just kind of like zoom out a little bit here is and it's easy to get lost in this because this is kind of um technical stuff you know so we looked at the the different algorithms for the outbound policies and you know when you look at those choices of where can I send this traffic it's going to show you okay I've got each individual internet connection I've got my fiber I've got my starlink I've got my 5G then it's going to also show you the tunnels so I've got a speed Fusion tunnel and I've got an ipsec tunnel so those are different doors that I could send that traffic into right now inside of speed Fusion we're like doing outbound policy on steroids right we're that that's that's where you're doing you're making packet level decisions so you're going Way Beyond what any of those load balancing algorithms can possibly achieve and so you're just kind of setting yourself up to have that success with the outbound policy manager you're saying my real-time traffic go to speed Fusion where you can do that super fast package shifting stuff where the normal internet can't accept that so speed Fusion kind of takes you up a level beyond what the outbound policy manager is capable of and I know they call me Professor P but traffic Travis I'm going to challenge you on that um a little bit right in front of everybody later because I want to go into the speed Fusion connect I actually I actually have a question that I want answered um officially because I wanted to understand speed Fusion as a destination and so we're going to play with that here live in just a minute I'm getting your little get your little amped up on that one but but we're gonna we're gonna address that live um so now I'm gonna do a demo oh there it is right there so we're gonna demo and the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to start simple and then go to complex so we're going to start with router-based outbound policies and we're gonna we're gonna just traffic shape based on source and destination um and the and and what's built into the router then I'm gonna go into the sfc protect and it's outbound policies once again local to the router and then I'm going to just quickly show the differences that are available on in control versus um sfc protect and the router so so that way we're you're not repeating information as we as we do that because you're only adding capability on the three tiers so let me um pull up my router so I have a wow that's big I mean zoom in is that better is that visible or better for you it's great yeah okay perfect um so as like I mentioned I have four internet connections I have a 218t a Verizon and T-Mobile uh and I do have sfc protect enabled right here um and so we will play around with that I've set up a Wi-Fi SSID already hd4mbx 5G and I have my laptop wirelessly connected and then I have a Poe uh camera connected and what I did is under network settings VLAN Networks I created a camera Network so VLAN 5 is my camera Network 192.1685.1 and then in the router I set port 1. under network settings port settings I set Port 1 as VLAN 5. so my camera is on its own dedicated VLAN and this is very common if you're in a broadcaster video you want your your video traffic to be isolated from your other traffic and there are special switches that have like ndi and SRT support that are really isolating that traffic and prioritizing it um not really designed for the scope of this conversation but but and a lot of times you're going to isolate that video traffic and so here we did that as well and I'm just going to demonstrate how we how we shape that traffic and then um and so I've created my VLAN there and then I set my Wi-Fi SSID and have my laptop connected and actually my phone connected so if I go to status Client List you can see there's my my uh my tablet um I have my um TV setup so my my Smart TV over here um and then I have my my phone on the Wi-Fi network as well and so you can see smartphone TV desktop and then my IP camera if the type doesn't show up you can actually click on this go to custom type and you can actually change the type to be the right type and then it actually reports that to peplink as well as changes it so if you're doing traffic shaping policy based on client type you can customize your client type right there okay so we're going to go to Advanced I needed to set that criteria before we do traffic shaping so that you understand where I'm defining those terms and then I'm gonna go to outbound policies and so these are the native outbound policies that have been historically available in peplink since like the first public router you know it's uh you know the ability to to shape traffic um has always been outbound policies the default policies are session persistence based on um based on source and then basically the source any destination if the if it's 443 enable persistence and it's basically saying if I'm established in SSL session stay on whatever internet connection I'm on until that session is terminated otherwise Auto and honestly that's a good basic rule if you just have two or three internet connections that are about the same that works it's it's when you're starting to get into these variable networks that we have to worry about it so I've got four 5G modems and they might or not not be 5G depending on where I'm at and and so I want to ensure that I have a little better quality and so I can add a rule and I can come here and say um sfc protect and I can save my sources any my destination is any my protocols any and I'll go into those more in a second but I want to show you this priority one I go priority and I can say sfc Protect and then I can drag all these other ones oh by the way we need to wait to just move all the Wayans because I have a bunch of ants and so I have to drag each one of them um but we get to drag all the wands and I I'm going to stop here because I don't care about the VLAN wins and then right here oh well yeah I've got my VLAN Advanced I was doing with the epx I have the 40 VLAN wins I was like um so and then when there are no connections are available what do you want to do so if sfc protect is down what do you want to do I say oh drop the traffic or fail through the next rule if sfc protect comes back what do you want to do do you want to keep the sessions where they are or do you want to force to terminate them and recover them on SSC protect a lot of times they say hey let those sessions be where they are once they're done the next session will go on SSC practice that way you're not terminating someone's Bank traffic or iMessage or FaceTime or whatever and so then I can hit save you know I think now that loud sorry to interrupt that last box I hear people refer to that as like fail back do you know I failed or do I want to fail back or do I want to just stay where I failed over to both are valid depending on yeah depending on your needs and a lot of times I check that box because I just wanted to go ahead and kick me back into it I mean because when you're talking about a mobile router especially when I'm working like on my Sprinter van and things like that I the the router will come up sessions will start passing speed Fusion connect will then go and what I'm saying is hey just terminate those sessions and throw them over speed Fusion because that way now I don't have to worry about my one T-Mobile line being used when I have a whole bunch of internet for other stuff um and so I'd prefer the interruption but some people don't like the interruption um whereas for me just a little blip of the connection during the boot up process doesn't bother me as much I'd prefer to have that speed Fusion connect um bonding rather than um waiting [Music] but most times that's that's like my default is to check if I figured giving a webinar checking that box they might go oh my gosh every time it it drops me so I wanted to explain why that's there um so so this is this is sort of a weird default Rule and we kind of did this when we talked about starlink and bonding um or dynamic weighted bonding but the idea is that I'm basically just saying hey use speed future connect if speedfusion connect fails then go ahead and just go back to your normal rules you know Auto session over load balance my four internet connections and then you know do do what you do best which is just to load balance my traffic and and that I I it's funny enough but that is a really good Baseline setup it's it's hey send me over speed Fusion connect but but otherwise um but um if that fails the downside here is my smart TV if I'm trying to stream Netflix sometimes speed Fusion connect can get blocked um from Netflix I see it as a VPN and my Netflix messes up so I can add a rule and I can say um smart TVs don't use it smart TVs and I can say if the source is a client type and I can say audio and video and the destination is anything anything and then I can say what do I want to do go over the least the least used because it's based on downlink right or it can go over the lowest latency this is a smart TV and it's going to be streaming content I'm gonna say go over the least used connection and then which connections do I wanna oh you can at least use cellular anymore in this we won't usually use in this example we're gonna do a lot of latency and then I'm going to choose my four Cellular Connections um and and so basically what I'm doing is I'm saying hey if Netflix starts a session use use the lowest latency connection at least use I forgot is wan only because it you actually date based it based on throughput um and I was so we're changing some stuff Associated at least used but um for the purpose of this video lowest latency is probably better than at least used especially over Cellular Connections so I can select my Cellular Connections um and then what do I want to do once again use any available connection or fall through the next Rule and so I'm a big fan of fall through the next Rule and then terminate on recovery now that's really doesn't matter too much because I'm saying hey here's here's my my internet connections I want you to use um but what's really cool here is a source client type I'm not defining this TV I'm saying if a TV connects to my network and it registers at an audio video device use that that like let that let that traffic go out the internet and not be bonded that way it can just it's not getting throttle it's not getting seen as a VPN to Hulu and Netflix and YouTube TV and things like that and I can hit save and and then there you'll see this outbound policy now show up that says my smart TVs are going to use the lowest latency connection every time a new Netflix server session is created um and then I'm not gonna go over every rule but just show you like weighted weighted uh balance weighted balance just gives you all of your internet connections and you can see those there you'll see in weighted balance there's no speed Fusion as a choice you can't wait a win with a speed Fusion it's um it's gonna be your your your physical or virtual lands that are that are available there all right I found something interesting earlier where it let me do that let me see if I can pull that up again um like I said like I said I know we're playing around with different firmware's and you and I are kind of in in all the new stuff um so yeah it's it's just interesting I'm I'm on 830 and when I choose weighted balance I get there's a connection type and I see speed Fusion or Wan so it'll let me do either one um huh well there you go I don't know I will send you a screenshot of that but yeah that's interesting some firmers are different um the uh and so uh persistent it's kind of interesting you're gonna get this source and destination so you can lock it by destination or source and then load distribution Auto or custom if you do custom you're going to get weighted and so there's your there's your weighted distribution or Auto it's just gonna it's just gonna automatically uh send that traffic and then what do you want to do drop the traffic so that all you have is that only drop the traffic enforced choose an internet connection it is that easy and you can see there's my speed Fusion connect protect so I could say if the source is a client type and it's a tablet destination any any enforced over speed Fusion act or I could say if the destination is a domain name client type is any and the destination is a corporate corp.app.com or whatever it might be always sfc protect that um and so you can you can change based on source and destination and like I mentioned earlier um you know we have IP address and network and Mac address client type and Associated SSID so you can say if the person is on a specific SSID um Wi-Fi SSID send their traffic out uh priority we just demonstrated that earlier but you basically have your list of priorities um what's once again nice is you can either drop the traffic or fail through and then terminate back and so you can use this in combination with other rules often I will have priority with just sfc protect there and that way then the next thing it does is go to a different rule that maybe uses those internet connections differently didn't mean to close that sorry overflow you'll see there's your wands and the reason why there's no cellulars there is because overflow you program your speeds cellular is variable so you can't overflow a Cellular Connection based on um based on variable throughput there's no like you can't say hey the 100 mags okay once I get to 100 mags but that salary connection only has 20. it's just going to try to use that 100 mag so it just doesn't work um so this is where you can program the throughput of the connection least used once again based on based on ethernet wins because least used is sending out um those uh um it's based on that download link lowest latency it'll allow you to send out that those third Hops and we I showed you that earlier with the the Netflix traffic and then fastest response time as well you'll get that list of the internet connections but not speed Fusion so least used and speed um and uh fast response time can't be applied to wins and speed Fusion at the same time this is where Travis is going to come in if I change the destination oh where's my do I have to set up a regular speed Fusion it's interesting I know what you're looking for yeah but does it not apply to speed Fusion protect uh yeah I thought it did but let me look at mine I'm gonna I am running uh the uh the patched firmware for synergy oh no I'm running stock 830559 yeah I'm on a okay I'm on 830. let me check I didn't create a VPN I could create a tunnel real fast let me let me create a speed Fusion I'm gonna pause my I'm going to pause my screen and create a speed future real fast but I gotta type in a password so give me just one second yeah yeah foreign Ty I wanna I wanna show you speed Fusion as a destination and I thought I could do that with speed Fusion Cloud but I swear I've done that but looking for an example of myself yeah I thought it was on speed Fusion connect but I guess it's it's not which is kind of funny you could have swore but I sent you those screenshots too of the other one I think you'll like that but it's creating the tunnels I've never done that destination speed Fusion before I actually wanted to ask you about it um on this webinar um so but I know it shows up when I have speed fusions I mean so so I've seen this feature and I've always wondered how it used it's it's used in application and so if I go to Advanced yeah I get the same problem so yeah that's okay yeah let me let me let me do it with it with an actual speed Fusion here or an outbound policy so now if I add a rule in my destination oh oh there's speed Fusion so like if my destiny you see a connection type when in speed Fusion now show up yeah yeah oh so okay yep so they moved it but no because now it's they get rid of that in 8.3 sorry I'm really sorry everybody I um I think both uh both of us are a little bit there used to be a speed Fusion option here in destination yeah I use that often yeah um okay well we won't talk about that right now then um [Laughter] maybe they took it out in 8.3 because it wasn't used um so uh so we're gonna skip that part of it and be a little bit embarrassed and we're gonna go to sfc protect and so the idea here is you can do it by source and destination um inside outbound policies with your eight algorithms and that's what you're limited to is source and destination eight algorithms and then using those internet connections and sfc protect I can come in here and I set up my client mode and then I I created my sfc uh tunnel which is currently active and then I can actually go into outbound traffic steering priority so I can choose route by application route by SSID or route by Lan client so I can send traffic destined for Zoom or teams so I can say if it is zoom go out sfc if I have multiple sfc profiles they'll all show up here so if I had sfc Dynamic weighted bonding or sfc Wan smoothing or sfc faster um sfc Atlanta or Miami they'll all show up here and then I can choose this and it's going to go based on priority so I can say Zoom goes out sfc hit save and it's going to create it's going to send that traffic out the sfc tunnel so if I go to zoom it's going to then connect sfc um additionally if I go so that that's optimizing Cloud applications then I can route my SSID so I can actually create an SSID called speedfusion connect protect right sfc Wi-Fi and if I'm connected to that Wi-Fi it's going to protect it so let me show you that oh actually um Travis do you want to explain that if I if I choose this and then I have this could I then just say sfc Wi-Fi and then it creates the rule is that what that's for okay yep I thought that's what it was for I don't use this feature very often and so I so basically I can choose my Wi-Fi my ht4 mbx5g and then I can make a new Wi-Fi called sfc Wi-Fi hit Plus and so now what's going to happen is is I'll have another SSID created called sfc Wi-Fi and that will um then I can then connect that sfc Wi-Fi and it'll automatically bond that traffic that's anything connected to that Wi-Fi so I can connect my TVs to it my smart devices if I have a work laptop and I just want all my traffic protected I could do that but if like my kids are on their Nintendo's or their their streaming something they don't need to stream or that like don't need to stream but like I don't want to waste um data for an sfc protect then I can not have to I just have them connect to the other Wi-Fi um so that's kind of a neat I love the the steering by Wi-Fi SSID and then the last thing they have is by Lan device so I can come back in here and go route route by land client and here I can choose my device so if I know that my TV my Smart TV here I can just say hey send this out um speedfusion connect um and I don't have to worry about it um so you can you can specify a device specify an SSID that anybody connects to that SSID is automatically goes out whatever profile you want or I can choose an application like teams and zoom if you want what I can do as well is go to um client mode sfc and we have a video on this so I I shouldn't you explain it fully but I just I can say Wan smoothing and then here I could turn on when smoothing on my connections hit save and now I have two profiles of speed Fusion connect profile and then a speed Fusion connect when smoothing profile and then that's going to allow me to use those profiles in the shaping policies so Peter I think I think the mystery on the speed Fusion destination thing I I found that same issue in my router GUI but on the incon I'm managing the policies from in control on that router so I think that those that destination does show up on the ic2 side so I don't know if that's a bug or if it's just oh okay so it might be because I'm in control and it's hiding that feature for me um on the GUI I think so because we can report it [Laughter] um anyway that um that's driving me crazy there yeah I was a little embarrassed by it but and see now I have this man smoothing so I can actually say you know uh WebEx can be when smooth and teams can be way and smooth I'm going to get rid of the zoom here and zoom can be way and smooth and so now my WebEx my teams and my zooms are way and smoothing but then my my business applications are sfc regular and so you can use this and it's really easy if you're just the end user just trying to control the shape the traffic it's very easy to do that with this um and I know we're late on time and I if I I hope everybody has some time here um I'd love to finish this with in control this is a lot more than I thought it would be um but there's a lot of good content here so the last thing we're going to do is talk about in control traffic shaping and so in in control traffic shaping we're going to just come into in control and um we can go into our outbound policies and you can create those group networks like I mentioned earlier so I can go into outbound policies and when we go into outbound policies there's two things to remember when you do an outbound policy traffic management one it is highly sensitive to the names of the wands so in my router my Wayans are Cellular One cellular two cellular three cellular four win one win two and then sfc and speed fusion and then sfc when smoothing if I hit apply changes um so that if I click apply changes for example and then it'll connect that Wan smoothing one and then it'll all have this land smoothing one if the name doesn't exist the rule won't apply so if you see an outbound policy rule that you created for Speed Fusion connect and it's not applying most likely the syntax the name of the connection isn't is it this is it matching so therefore it's not applying so it's probably maybe maybe we've misspelled it or it doesn't exist on that internet connection Etc so I can go into manage outbound policies create a rule set and then here I can click add Rule and you'll see that I get the same type of of page here Source destination protocol algorithm and then here's the different Wayans and it's not getting my wins it's giving me the names so and that's why like I was talking about priority and how annoying it is watch this I can create that same priority I can say sfc um priority and I can say Source in any destination any protocol any priority speed Fusion sfc add Delta the next rule terminate sessions okay now I have that same rule I created but I didn't have to drag all those policies over it's just right there and so now my default rule here is Bond sfc I can then add a rule that says um uh web meetings and I can go with the sources um any the destination is a SAS and then I can choose like Google and zoom and WebEx and Microsoft teams and then I can say priority when smoothing oops sorry with a tunnel when smoothing and see I spelled it wrong that's where it would fail and then I can click add and so I have my speed Fusion connect when smoothing tunnel and what do I want to do fell through the next rule terminate sessions those are just my defaults you don't have to do that and save and so now I've got a rule it says web meetings are going to go over Wan smoothing if it is Google Zoom WebEx Skype or teams if it's not one of those it's going to go over speed Fusion connect if I add a rule here again in destination if you look at the destinations I've got a lot more now I've got IP address ipnetwork domain name speed Fusion or VPN network which is what I wanted to ask uh Travis about so I'll make another video just on that for you guys because I that does confuse me uh grouped Network SAS like uh so I once again choosing the SAS um or region so I can say if the destination is the United States um do something or whatever country you want to have um and so you can actually do Regional based outbound policies on my source I have IP address network Mac address and then once again that grouped Network so we can control based on that grouped a group of IP addresses um and so so in control gives us that flexibility to control um to make those policies a little bit easier to manage and then it applied to all your routers as well or a select router so here I can say device selection on any of the following tags all the following tags or devices with none of the following tags and if you don't know what tags are I do have an in control 2 video where you can talk about tagging and the overview of just in control in general um but the idea is that you can control the flow of your traffic and there's three really powerful ways to do it based on your deployment topology and or your use case um and so that is uh in control and just adding that Regional and SAS applications right into the router I do have some q a and so I'm going to see if I can pull that up um sip isn't missing from a protocol sip is an IP um so uh someone asked that they see sip is missing um it might not it might not be available in the drop downs but when you go protocol you can do TCP UDP a dscp or IP sip is usually 50 60. so you can say destination single port 50 60 and then you'd have like sip traffic so you could say sip traffic is enforced right out my fiber line or you know whatever you want to do there in this particular case it'd be a Wan one um or Cellular One or whatever you want to do um but but so if if the protocol and the protocol selection doesn't have everything but that's where the beauty the destination ports and a sip traffic uses different ports um depending on if it's a Cisco or standard um and so you can you can customize pretty much any port based on destination least used a downlink you can't do as we as we learned live in this session uh over uh over at least use can't be applied to Cellular because we can't control the downlink bandwidth um so you're going to use lowest latency um or fastest response time or use bonding which if you haven't watched our bonding video I highly advise it because it talks about taking the maximum advantage of all your Cellular Connections with Dynamic weighted bonding um Ernesto asked a question about creating a star topology without using end control um if you want to email me Ernesto that would be a different different conversation um you might email Travis peplink.com or Peter westnetworks.com and we're more than happy to to show you how to how to set that up um I've actually had two uh responses with India we I believe we do have an Indian partner but you could reach out to Travis peplink.com for out of the out for services outside the US and he'll put you in contact with the right partner to help you with that client type does not exist in ic2 it is directly in the GUI um and so uh Ricardo asked uh and and we can see that right here source is different and so there there are different options depending on your use case and design that client type is sort of a lookup that's happening local on the device and you're linking those clients in the status Client List I would assume that's going to come to in control later but a lot of times when we develop a new feature it gets pushed out to the router then it gets uh pushed up to in control because with the router in control is interfacing with the router so often you'll see a feature come to the router just a little bit faster than it comes to in control Adrian asked a really good question about the ssids I've never used that feature outside of this webinar so for troubleshooting I would love to work with you on that um once again if you email support westnetworks.com uh or Peter westnetworks.com I'd be more than happy to get you in contact with an engineer but but Adrian basically said that Associated SSID only works on traffic with the internal AP um I've never in production never used that feature um so I wouldn't be able to speak to it outside of the context but I'm glad that that you know that and I would love to work with you on potentially solving that um Adam asked a question about notifications of lands there is a lan status but not a monitoring that would be like maybe like an SNMP agent um monitoring Your Land network the peplink is really monitoring um your your traffic um through the through the router not on the Lan um and so I would look at an s p agent or like a like a a I mean we use we use site 24 7 to monitor agents um so you could use like a monitoring tool like that to monitor the status of land devices not really Associated outbound policies but really cool question huh oh one second so Ricardo says because we were showing this off here and speed Fusion Cloud was missing and he said we have to be in expert mode to see this and I would like to test that real fast so he says turn on expert mode and now we have that so if I add a rule look at you thank you Ricardo that's gonna drive me in so if you try to expert mode wow look at that you learned something new every day um I almost always turn on expert mode I factory reset this router and that makes sense so you add the rule and now I have my destination speed Fusion connect and speed Fusion profiles I will release a an updated video with Travis about this um so I think thank you Ricardo that's awesome uh pet VPN is renamed speed Fusion sfc is peplink's cloud service so if like I have my own speed Fusion server I've got an sdx here in my office I've got a fusion Hub up in uh up in Azure and so I can speed Fusion or pep VPN to those destinations sfc protect or sfc is peplinks publicly available bonding service um and so uh sfc is just peplinks a lot of our military customers say it's dirty internet all right it's like plug-in cable modem so sfc protect is the ability to bond without any existing infrastructure um my other videos are um are on peplinkuniversity.com or west Network youtube.com forward slash westnetworks LLC I love creating content um if you have any questions or feedback um I love to make those videos and push those out as well as share information I'm really uh I'm still stunned about the expert mode gotten changed on where that is so thank you Ricardo for that I throw out to Ricardo for for answering that um trying to see if there's any other questions I know we're over so I just want to make be respectful of everybody's time um thank you so much I will release a supplemental video um on on that that one question that I actually had which is how do we effectively use that destination profile because I see it but then it says enforced when and I don't know if that's saying enforced inside the tunnel or if it's letting me then select it I'm assuming you can say how the internet's used inside the tunnel so basically if I say sfc and then I can say priority use cellular one then two then three then four or I can say enforced over Wan one um which we like starlink inside sfc I'm pretty sure that that is the case I've just never applied it in Practical use I'm a huge fan of the bonding technology as a whole um but I'm assuming that when you do destination sfc or sfc protect what you're doing is you're saying inside the tunnel how do I want to use those lands so I could bond fiber and cellular and then say always use the fiber line and then if the fiber fails then go to Cellular right um and that would be the priority you use my ethernet line then use my cellular um or Bond it so that's that's why just having having Travis so I'll work through that um but I once again thank you Ricardo for uh for letting me turn that feature back on because new firmware they changed that um any other questions okay well in that case I'm just say thank you so much for uh listening to us today and um and once again um we'll see you next month on the second Tuesday of the month if you have any suggestions that you'd like to learn or talk about with Travis and I it's going to be um uh you can email Travis peplink.com or Peter westnetworks.com if we do choose your stuff you might get some free swag so if you have any suggestions throw it out there and we might send you uh send you some swag so thank you very much and have a great day"}

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "all right folks let's dive in this is our second pep talk today we're going to talk about how peplink works with private 5G private LTE it's a big topic one that's been around for a few years but all of a sudden really making a big comeback and a really big push a lot of different customers and so from that side we've got Michael Maitland joining us again Mike has been involved with us over the years on some many private LTE projects in the past and again he's talking to customers almost every day about this stuff so Mike thanks for joining us thanks Travis for having us all right pretty excited to get to get talking about uh private LTE all ever since we called it cbrs and and now to the private LTE Daisy you know it's it's been a long time coming and we're starting to see a lot of momentum in this space and excited to talk more about it and how peplink plays a role cool we're gonna jump in and really you know the whole point of this is It's Not Easy right that there's challenges that come up when when people are looking at deploying private 5G private LTE and you know the first thing is just how do we get all these devices connected I think just as a basic level a lot of folks are looking at private 5G private LTE not so much as a Wan technology like you know like a typical cellular network would be used to get to the internet but it's more being used as a lan technology so often replacing or enhancing Wi-Fi so you can think of it used very similar to Wi-Fi but you know just like Wi-Fi everybody's got to have that chip that capability on device to connect to that Network and so um you know iPads iPhones those things have that connectivity built in but there's lots of other devices that don't have that private 5G private LTE connectivity capability built in and so that's really where peplink comes in and it's not just about getting a connected doing it reliably 24 7 365 and whatever environments uh customers are needing that in and so you know Mike I know just at a basic level you're talking to customers out there and hearing about people deploying these networks what kind of things are they talking about when they kind of jump into it yeah you know with building out the the infrastructure for private LTE there's a lot of time planning there's a lot of cost involved and and it's not a simple task and when it comes to kind of the connectivity piece that that final stage where peplink plays a role it's all about having the trust and the product the trust in the portfolio and technology and really be able to handle everything you need to comfortably because so much time and cost has been spent on it already it makes no sense to bring in a device at that time that maybe you just have a little doubts on or or don't trust fully or are isn't all fully integrated with with other pieces of your technology so I think that's what peplink really stands out is is to have the trust Factor they have the portfolio to to provide a solution for any application in regard to private LTE but they also have the backbone and the systems to help you manage and take care of it uh with with a lot of uh can you know with just just being very confident right and I think that's really where peplink stands out here yeah I think the trust is you know a big thing that I've heard too it's it's like you said there's infrastructure there's planning there's engineering that goes into these networks and you know they're they have a lot of great capabilities but it's a big investment so yeah when you need to get all these other devices connected and being able to be confident that yeah you've got the right device that's going to rely be reliable every every day every minute every second and you know it's not just something off the shelf that's gone through testing and certification and so definitely that's what we bring there's there's lots of different devices you know there's Wi-Fi devices there's ethernet devices there's serial devices and so again if we think about this like if we were going to replace our Wi-Fi network in a manufacturing facility what are the devices we need to connect well there's probably some sort of barcode scanners out there there's a lot of Wi-Fi barcode scanners and so coupling can be that bridge to that scanner connected to the private LTE the private 5G but there's also just you know ethernet computers and Terminals and all kinds of devices but again we go through that certification that interoperability testing with these private 5G vendors to make sure that you know we don't just have the technical specs on the data sheet but it's actually something that's going to work reliably in a real world customer scenario yeah we just help connect anything with an IP that you need access yeah right yep that's a good point yeah it's you know it's hard to predict what that device will be that that this customer that customer needs to connect to their their private 5G network but again we've got that portfolio to fit in there whether it's a mobile or a stationary or indoor outdoor use case yeah so with that there's there's a sample of our private 5G and five private 5G and private LTE lineup so on the bottom we've got our single radio devices so a lot of people just need a device to get them connected again maybe bridge that gap between this new private 5G Network and whatever Legacy Ethernet or serial or Wi-Fi device they have so we've got a really awesome introductory device there that beer One Mini cat7 um that that's fully private LTE capable and tested on lots of different vendors and it's pretty darn affordable at 349 so that's really a starting point for a lot of customers when they need just that reliable simple device if we look at the 5G side we've got the br1 pro 5G again that's that's a price leader for that that uh category of product having a rugged reliable always on ready uh 5G device and again all of these devices are also interoperable with the commercial Network so you can put a private Sim and uh and a commercial Sim in there and hand off between the two and if you want to grow that capability then we've got the multi-radio devices so that ubr plus and that br2 Pro you can put two cards in simultaneously so you can combine that private and Commercial cellular network for different Advanced use cases and that that's really really important to highlight Travis so you know if you just need that basic connection we can do that but peplink thanks so much further with its technology and its software and allowing the bonding the seamless uh transition from one caching connection to the other depending on the application you may have integrate Wi-Fi you may integrate the private LTE you may integrate uh the the commercial LT as well right and the pepney technology really allows you to seamlessly move between those if that's the case or again if it's just a private Network you're trying to connect to we work well there as well with the management and everything but the portfolio allows you to really do and truly deploy what you need to to accomplish with the the multi modem devices but the multi-wan kind of solution that peplink and speed Fusion bring to the table yeah and we've seen you know a lot of our partners that we're talking to in this space you know they're they're being this expert for the end customers they're deploying these private networks and so for them it's not just a One-Stop solution right that they're going to build this network for this customer and they're going to go to another customer and build another Network and so they need that lineup they need something more than just one device they need that kind of ladder of options as they run into different scenarios and so again that that's really what we bring to the table is that consistent reliable experience but also the portfolio to to meet the needs of each each deployment simple or complicated definitely and the Space is really heating up and so we're we're full attention here and we're trying to to make this as easy as possible for customers and so we've got a couple promotions out there right now targeting the private LTE private 5G space and so we've got the br1 mini cat7 and so we've got a bundle price with three years of prime care for 449 MSRP and then we've got that dual radio ubr plus which is also capable of dual private LTE and that's again a three-year bundle at 749 so these are super affordable devices and again you've got that reliable vendor interoperability tested um backing of these so both great options and you know even even at that ubr plus that's a heck of a price for a dual radio so you can start looking at all kinds of advanced situations true dual radio to be able to use them at the same time I mean that that's a price point leader but really seeing that these are two of the more popular choices when when people are looking at building out the private LTE so that blink went to bad and put together a good promotion for it getting the three-year bundle makes it a lot easier for the deployment and the management ongoing and getting all the capabilities that the Prime Care brings the table across the management platform some data pieces and speed fusion and bonding along with the hardware as well so really great like like you talked about earlier Mike these are these are Big Investments these are Big efforts these aren't things that people are doing for one year and so we we thought that these three-year bundles made a lot of sense and of course we're trying to make the price point easier to easier to make that investment too so yeah um for partners out there to take advantage of this all you need to do is have a valid deal registration and mention this promotion in that deal registration so that we've got an understanding of the the private LTE private 5G scope of the project and that's really all there is to it um so yeah that's a promotion we've got running right now so again when we're deploying when customers are deploying private 5G private LTE there's there's a lot of kind of like Baseline concerns people have they want rugged devices they want things to work in extreme temperatures and they want it to be easy straightforward to deploy right out of the box so it's scalable and so that brings you into the management side of it right these these aren't just one-off devices that you're going to throw out there and forget about the things that you need to make sure are running every day every minute because it's a business running underneath of that and so that's where the management piece comes in and again that's another peplink Baseline capability that we bring that just really stands out around competitors are in control to product is the cloud Management Service that we have um but you know so it does all the basic powerful Cloud management things like zero touch provisioning so that you can centralize firewall and security policies and just keep tabs on what's working and what's not but a big decision in private 5G private LTE is how the architecture is laid out some customers have very focused goals inside of their building on premise and so a lot of customers choose to deploy private 5G completely on premise no internet connectivity and so with peplink they can still have that centralized management experience in that on-premise scenario so they can run the in Control software there and if not if they're using the more Cloud oriented approach we've got our hosted platform there on on the internet ready to go as well and so Mike I know you see you run into that a lot not just in private LTE 5G but that that ability to have the private and control seems to be a big differentiator out there you know the the number of people that need it is minimum but when they do it's it's a deal breaker right and and the the private in control really allows a flexible deployment at you know decision from from what the customer needs and demands and and so it really is a great solution when it when it comes down to that and and again it's kind of how peplink looks at it they want to be flexible cost applications deployments and really be able to fit the void or fit the need of any of those depend no matter what the customer is demanding or the customer needs right um one thing I will say kind of skipping back to that previous slide you mentioned uh Travis is you know the seamless integration that peplink brings to the table with its drop-in mode and IP pass-through different things like this that can coexist with existing Network equipment in different things make it an easy deployment as well right and that's something that we see a lot of times as being a big factor there or or a big positive because you don't need to change everything so going along with everything we've mentioned on this slide that that's another big piece that that really allows a an easy deployment no matter what your current infrastructure is yeah it's all about integration I mean at the end of the day there's probably something already that the customer has and we're trying to build something bigger and better and so yeah the more flexible we can be with you know the options we have we're able to stay a little you know stay with the customer's requirements no matter if it goes you know private on premise or public in the cloud open you don't lose functionality in either scenario then so another big piece of functionality that peplink offers that we see a lot of interest with in the private 5G and LTE spaces our new in-touch featuring so this is Remote Management for devices that are behind the pep link so um we're going to go through a lot of different customer deployment scenarios and give you better detailed examples of like what people are doing with these networks but again you know video surveillance is a pretty common one on any network and so you know if you've got a private 5G Network and you want to be able to log into the IP cameras behind that again in touch and in control are what gives you that capability we've got an ambulance for Everyone by here let's come in time or not but um but yeah in touch yeah InTouch is a great feature the flexibility and the ease to be able to access your devices behind the peplink I mean it's just kind of getting known within the within the channel and and their customers and it's kind of a little different from what people are used to with their Auto Management Solutions but the ease of setting up uh the ease of of accessing uh this this is a great feature that peplink added to in control that is really a game changer um and and the accessibility is it just makes it so simple yeah I mean people are deploying peplink in private 5G networks so that they can connect some sort of device behind it right whether that's a camera a PLC a Windows Server we don't know right but yeah they're connecting those devices and so of course they're going to want to manage those devices as well and so this makes it so much simpler to manage those devices in those private networks again whether it's you know that on-prem or Cloud configuration InTouch is a feature that you can bring along with for for any of those scenarios just kind of shows into it in intuition of Pep link Engineers to kind of create and bring features that really help yeah yeah it's it's that it's that feature that you know once everybody sees it that the light bulbs go off and all of a sudden they can think of how they can make something easier in their job with that capability and so on that note we've got a bunch of different applications and scenarios here that we're having conversations with or we have active deployments with customers using private 5G private LTE and so warehouses and as well as the automated warehouses where we're seeing actually automated robots doing the picking of off the shelves manufacturing industrial sites again autonomous systems or even the teleoperated systems we see a lot of different use cases there shipping and transportation security surveillance airports campuses events I mean there's just all kinds of scenarios that people are looking at at private 5G and LTE for yeah and if you just break it down into something a little more simple you know any any any application that has a large footprint or potential interference for a Wi-Fi network not to be ideal or high death high density with or congestion or not good cellular signal these are these are the places that private 5G or private LTE really really make sense yeah yeah that's a good point I mean people are usually either fighting with capacity because they've got so many users right it could be you know those events types of networks or airports again where there's just so many users at once that the commercial networks just can't deliver the business critical experience and so private's an option there but also like you said warehouses things where you're more fighting you know with your environment you've got yeah you know just challenging things that just really push Wi-Fi to the limits so dive in here and look at some of these uh the warehouse one is one we see a lot um and there's a variety of different Technologies we're seeing out there you know we're seeing tele operated forklifts we're seeing the autonomous forklifts um you know there's just a really human crunch out there for labor and people to to run these Warehouse services and run these forklifts in the warehouses and so um this this is one example we've got of a customer who's using private 5G inside the warehouse and they've got a teleoperated forklift so they take an existing normal human forklift they retrofit it with some sensors and cameras and drive-by-wire system but again they're just modifying that existing traditional forklift and they're putting a br1 mini on it and they're using that to connect it to that private 5G private LTE inside the warehouse and then remotely over the internet at home they've got a driver and that guy's sitting on the internet using a br1 pro 5G connected to his landline Internet connected to a cellular internet so he's got speed Fusion all the way back to the warehouse and they can just fill jobs for that that driver so he can sit there at it at his comfortable gaming chair at home and he hops from one forklift to another forklift to another forklift just by clicking on things on those computer screens so he can go pick jobs and and move that operation really fast remotely and not have to be there on site very fascinating to be honest it's crazy yeah I mean the future now right we're we're living it and that's that's the cool thing is these Technologies are enabling that and it's not just science fiction anymore it's actual Solutions now for for people I think this one's a good example too of where the the technology ladder really allowed the the project to move forward right each step of the way from you know just the simple connectivity inside the warehouse from that private 5G to the forklift but then the speed Fusion side of it out to the internet that remote driver right all those pieces need to be there for this to be a reliable scalable commercially viable solution and um yeah we had every piece needed to make that make that work so broadcasting events is another area where we see just a ton of demand whether it's video production types of scenarios or it's Live Events where you've got the general public in for big concerts or festivals or sporting events um again those either those events are happening in location for the commercial coverage isn't great or there's just so many people that's not realistic for the commercial networks to deliver uh results on the business side again for that those internal use cases yeah and so events are tough too Travis because it may work perfect when you're testing it out demoing and then when foot traffic starts coming in that congestion becomes real and you have to plan ahead for that and and be confident that the solution is going to work right and private LTE really takes a lot of those challenges out of play don't have to think about it anymore yep I think anybody who's ran a live event has the has the scars of that like oh my gosh it worked yesterday what's wrong today and no pressure we're just live um and so that was something I got to experience um in person last fall with with the Subaru Motorsports team so they did a live broadcast at a race event um and we used private LTE to to connect the cameras um to serve as Wi-Fi hotspots for other users it had non-private 5G capable devices and so we're able to integrate with this whole video live video production environment so that when all the fans showed up and again it worked great on Commercial cellular the day before but we knew that wasn't going to be a reliable idea on game day and so we were able to leverage a private LTE infrastructure and have that reliable video broadcast and that reliable internal uses um all day long without without having to to fight with the public that was there and so it was a great solution but yeah again it's something you can see it's not hard to imagine how this how this works and what the need for that is again there's just so many use cases out there where you need that reliability either to deal with congestion or again to deal with the physics the environments right the the metal and the racking and all the inventory and warehouses so um you know warehouses are an area where we see people wanting to do that kind of hybrid where they got the trucks out driving in the field and using public commercial cellular networks but then when they get back to the warehouse side they want to switch over to that private LTE that private 5G Network and so devices like that br1 mini beer one pro 5G have that dual SIM dual network capability yeah again this is where the the whole kind of ecosystem of Pep link products software Services really come into play and are able to to tackle any application you know that seamlessness from going from network type to network type it is is really A Difference Maker and the flexibility makes it easy yeah and these are devices that are certified commercially on these commercial networks as well and so again when you start looking at what device am I going to use it's going to do all these different things again we've got devices that are tested on the private side and they're and they're tested on the on the public side as well so they just bring that that reliability and yeah and I'll manage from one platform you know yeah you can you can do anything from a computer anywhere with with no matter where they're deployed or or the application yep yeah and you know no matter where they're deployed what the security and surveillance a lot of times people want these outside right they're on a on a camera on a light pole they're they're looking out over parking lots or looking at all kinds of environments where again it's just not going to be your off the shelf kind of commercial standard device you need something ruggedized reliable and so whether it's putting the beer One Mini inside of a weatherproof box it's still got that um rugged temperature range so it can still survive in those areas but we've also got the outdoor ready HD1 Dome Pro which has all the antennas and everything built in sealed for those outdoor scenarios yeah the product line allows you really to use the same manufacturer for all your applications that allows the management deployment all everything to be a lot easier and seamless right you don't have to skip between different management platforms and different uh manufacturers themselves because we have the whole portfolio to handle this yep so yeah if you've got multiple user groups you've got the public you've got your internal users you can separate that all out have have it all make sense with like you said one management system one one product line here's another scenario we've seen at airports this is another you know not that hard to imagine scenario right where there's all kinds of people showing up and leaving right hundreds of people show up at a moment's notice and so the commercial networks just kind of have these ebb and flow moments where the business users there aren't going to always get the most reliable connection experience and so again private LTE private 5G just makes sense whether it's cameras or luggage vehicles or the airport police there's a variety of different needs out there there's kiosk there's all kinds of different things that people want to connect in these environments and some of them have a whole bunch of technical parameters around them and some of them are pretty straightforward right just get my camera online but yeah again that's the whole product line that we've got and that technology service offering with speed fusion and other possibilities there yeah but something like this you can't just you just can't risk something on the commercial side right you have to to leverage multiple connection items or do something like this um with private LTE where you're just you're you're always going to have that connection that availability to to to talk to the devices to the applications you need to um you just can't risk it on the commercial side you know so that covers all the content here I'm gonna I see we've got a couple questions teed up right now so I'm going to open those up and folks feel free um to pile some more questions on there so first question I see is can we just back up and talk about how private LTE and 5G Works does peplink have a solution on the tower side and so um similar to how the commercial networks work peplink is a client device for these private networks we don't make the private LTE core systems we make the client devices and so they they'll call that UE or user equipment as kind of a technical term used in these networks but um no we work with all the all the infrastructure vendors out there to get certified clients for their networks so we're not providing that Tower side we're just providing again just like on the commercial networks that that client-side experience I see one question why use private 5G instead of Wi-Fi so I've seen it firsthand and I wasn't I wasn't as confident going into it that it was going to really be that game changer because I've used private I've used Wi-Fi with you know Highgate antennas high power I've I've seen Wi-Fi deployed at you know parameters well beyond I think normal office use but um the private 5G private LTE just really does far exceed the capabilities of Wi-Fi in terms of coverage in terms of roaming it just provides a much more stable and reliable experience for those scenarios so whether you've got you know I've seen that in outdoor environments where there's no way that Wi-Fi would have punched through the the amount of trees that we were connecting through in private private 5G private LTE had no problem it was super stable it was super reliable so just about the properties of the cellular networks the cellular protocols enables a much more reliable connection than Wi-Fi is able to deliver so that's a big part of it um but Mike I think like you talked about is that capacity it's that private Spectrum as well yeah there's a lot you know the scalability too is is a lot easier when you're doing that just think back if you're in a big footprint or a lot of interference that Wi-Fi is a difficult thing you need a lot of APs or or maybe more than a lot right and and with private LTE it just simplifies it and then you get the benefits of the of this of a cellular light Network as well so it really combines the benefits of both the Wi-Fi and the seller and to make one kind of Premium Network for you yeah so I see some questions about the bands or operating frequencies these will vary country to country but in general I'll step take a step back here and just list them out here um so yeah n38 n41 n48 n77 n78 n79 I mean we're getting into alphabet soup here but these are different 5G bands that are commonly used for private networks and so um depending on the country and and region you're in those may change but those are the common ones that we see people using out there and again the the devices we've shown you are all capable of those those device those bands you know so the N being 5G the B being um LTE or 4G but um if you dig into each of these models that we've shown here you can go see you know commercial and private Spectrum what what bands they all support but yeah these ones that we've picked out on the on the lineup here are really the ideal models in terms of having all of those all those private private 5G bands one question an airport example why would I need speed Fusion when connecting a single camera I I don't think that you would normally um you know if if you need a redundant backup or you there's a concern about the private LTE not having enough bandwidth then maybe you would but no in most cases like that airport example we're just using something like that HD1 Dome to be that single interface to connect with probably just an Ethernet camera um so that HD1 Dome pro has that private 5G modem in it and you're just going to plug that camera's ethernet port into that and be that kind of pass-through device or pass-through connection so normally I wouldn't see speed Fusion in these deployments but like that br2 Pro on the the airport police there's a lot of cases where yeah they're going to want access to every commercial Network and and the private Network at the same time for you know depending on the footprint they cover where they're going and just the critical nature of what that person is doing versus that single fixed camera there still are benefits though you know the Simplicity of setting it up and connecting through pep VPN right or or the speed Fusion the access you get behind the the peplink router from in control within touch especially for security camera and things like that so even when one connection you can see benefits it just may not have that multi-wan seamless benefits that you see a lot of times in public deployments yeah another question about the airport I see why would I need 5G on a luggage card I'm not telling you you do that's just an example well that's that's up to customers they can put the br1 mini there as well that's that's really a deployment customer specific thing it's it could go either way on that you know in some vendors it's 5G only and some vendors do a mix 5G and 4G so sometimes it has to be one or the other and sometimes it it really is just up to the project requirements so I see a question about having 35 locations and um kind of difficult access to Internet at all those locations um would this be a great solution I would say private 5G might not be the fit for that because you're distributed so much you would have to have private 5G infrastructure in those locations but um we do have the integrated speed Fusion connect 5G and LTE which is just commercial cellular data but in a in a pool multi-carrier plan and so that I think would be a good fit because then you know you don't know T-Mobile ATT Verizon which network you're going to need at each 35 locations but yeah I think that's basically separate from the private 5G side I see another question about the private LTE discount or promotion there valid deal registration required so to get that discount or promotional price yes you need to have a valid deal registration through peplink so that's just your that's your ticket to get that discount basically is having that approved deal Ridge yeah and if you if that's something you're not used to doing or don't know how reach out to distributor they'll help you um with with that every step of the way and help you get that approved yeah absolutely I see a question that's simple but hard to answer Dewayne what kind of cost is involved in putting up one private LTE so we see different pricing models dramatically different pricing models from vendors on the infrastructure side um there's vendors like Amazon that's doing private private 5G private LTE and they're they're pricing it a lot like the AWS format where you pay for the hour and so that's a format that is going to be really helpful for a lot of people and it's going to be probably not helpful for some people too and so that's one way when you see it being done so that The Upfront cost is pretty low but on the other side of it we see people deploying it as you know more like a traditional Wi-Fi investment whereas infrastructure and they're paying for the deployment and the ongoing maintenance of it and we also see kind of in the Middle where vendors are standing it up as a service and it's more of a more of a capability that somebody's bringing in as a managed service for the end customers so it can vary a lot is the short answer a few more questions here Travis um so is there any benefit to having a device specifically made for private LTE it you know it depends you know of course you need to have those private LTE frequencies and capabilities on there and so that's you know that's your Baseline right if you don't have that you're not it's not going to do anything for you in this stupid case beyond that again it's that vendor testing so you've got a handful of companies that really are the major players in in that private LTE infrastructure side and so um you know if that device is going through that testing that's definitely an advantage or a benefit because again they're going to know that it works well in these commonly deployed scenarios yeah to me Travis um for peplink specifically you know I just don't think there is a value to have a private LG only type of device because that limits you then to the capabilities peplum can bring from the multi-wan scenario the seamless failover for different applications right if you want to integrate different things some of the you know the pat what prep link brings to the table and having that kind of ability to do the commercial side the Wi-Fi side but also the private LTE side really brings a lot of benefits and you're not losing anything if you only use it for the private LTE right so the flexibility again makes in the way that peplink works and the technology they have make it make sense to have it all combined and not just one device yeah you may deploy peplinks all the time on Commercial networks and never deploy them on private networks but it's capable of it so it doesn't take anything away from you you don't have to use it in that way but you can and same way going the other side is you know you may only deploy these as private LTE connections and never use the commercial capabilities of it but either way it's that same Global SKU and so it's you know just a consistent product in that sense too it's it's available and it's in demand for a lot of different use cases and so for us that helps streamline these models for you know being able to use for lots of different things but yeah but yeah as long as we're going through those Baseline requirements of you know having the capabilities and having that interoperability testing I think those are the real benefits and you don't need a dedicated product for that yeah I see one question saying private LTE is not available in their market yet but they use private APN SIM cards from the the commercial networks with no internet access and so that's that's a common middle ground or I guess stepping stone that we see where it's kind of it's like a VPN almost on the commercial networks um but they said with that they can't use in control and so there's two ways you could use in control um number one if if that carrier is allowed to open if you're if you allow that carrier to open up outbound access there's just a couple ports you would need to open up outbound to the public in control but you can also run in control privately inside of that that private Network as well so you can run in control in a complete Zero Internet environment completely 100 air gapped it never has to connect or touch the internet ever and so you can download all your license keys and and text files and load them in that way so there's no internet exposure ever so that's we call icva or in control virtual Appliance so that is something you can solve with with what we have out there right now um there's just a couple ways you you might do that but yeah that's another one of those talk to your partners talk to your distributor um to dig deeper into that because we try and make that available to anybody who who's got those scenarios and we again that's a that's a hard mandatory requirement for certain projects Mike I know we've seen that in a lot of different customers utilities and government and service providers too yeah it's definitely a game changer when needed yep all right folks I think we've covered all the questions here um yeah thanks so much for joining it's you know the space is heating heating up crazy like like we said we're having conversations almost every day every week for sure and we're just seeing more and more applications and use cases so reach out if you've got questions reach out if you've got opportunities of course and take advantage of those uh those promotions we've got there to get high quality tested ruggedized private LTE private 5G devices out there yeah thanks for having us um look forward to our next next pep talk if you guys have any ideas or or topics you'd like us to discuss please feel free to give us some suggestions where we're always looking for ideas but uh we'll see you next month thanks again folks take care"}

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "I think we're ready to get started I don't know how many people are on there but yeah we're good I think okay yeah let's uh let's get this going because if everybody has been waiting so patiently so uh my name is Peter West ever otherwise known as Professor p and with me is uh Travis Derek from peplink and today we're going to talk about Edge Computing and the capabilities in uh peplink's routers ecosystem for uh either application Docker and virtualization and so um what is Edge Computing uh Edge Computing is this I don't want to say New Concepts I hate that when people do that because I feel like it's a marketing term but I think it is relatively like actually is kind of a a new idea of bringing applications to your Edge routing or your sd-wan router capabilities so basically adding capability to your to your to your Wan Edge or your your router and so peplink has done this with uh we now call it Edge Computing it used to be called media fast for our content caching uh and so it's sort of been around for a long time and that's what's also really neat about peplink you know sd-wan wasn't called sd-wan when peplink started doing sd-wan and Edge Computing wasn't called Edge Computing when coupling started doing Edge Computing we called it media fast um and so the idea is by adding applications uh Docker KVM virtualization directly to the peplink router so you can run processes or workflows anywhere I mean I'm in my RV and there's my br2 Pro 5G running Docker images so uh I don't know if Travis you want to add to that I I know I'm getting the buzzwords right so yeah I think if we just kind of like take a step back and look you know look at like you know the whole history of computing right we had you know way back in the original days we had Mainframe technology right and that was like centralized application running on a server in your building in your office and that worked great right all your users are kind of connected to that local network and then you've got this one Central application but then you know in the in the 2000s we really moved to the cloud right everything was on the cloud and everything got outside of your office and there's no need for servers anymore and the cloud is going to do it all for you but you know the users are still at the edge and the edge has gotten way further out now too right Peter's in a sprinter van you know in in 1990s we weren't trying to run applications in a sprinter van we were in our office in our suits and ties doing doing these things and so you know the cloud is great but you know when we're out at the edge we need things fast and reliable and stable out there too and so there's kind of this hybrid happening now where we're running things on the edge but also leveraging that that cloud side to really make the two work together and so that's really what Edge Computing is all about from a you know a big cloud connected Edge yeah exactly um one a good example is the first iteration of this was our application or content caching capability so peplink started off with this media Fast Appliance that that added content caching capabilities which then got increased I apologize there's a there's a bus out there honking but um then got this uh then we added application support and the application support means that now you can run native uh python oh man help me out here Python and we got python we got Docker and then we've got full like the docker separates and in the app we have Python and give me one second oh just just the Ruby applications yes thank you Python and Ruby that I was missing that one so we have Python and Ruby as native application support built right into the peplink router which means you can write a program a website right inside your router and so you can build a web app and actually download that right to the peplink router and then run that natively I'm going to demonstrate that later um and then we have uh Docker support Docker allows us to run containerized applications or virtual machines in a sense um on the peplink routers which allows to spin up multiple instances of Docker applications and be able to deploy those out in the field and so one of the things that we've done on our demo router is we have a Docker Pie Hole uh to act as an ad an add-on to my DNS services so basically I can have enhanced DNS capabilities built right into my peplink router further we increase that by doing a forwarder to a cloud Fair DNS encrypter so basically when from my router my if you connect to the VR2 Pro 5G that I have and get an IP address from DHCP the DNS is going to be the pie hole the pie hole has a forward or that goes to um my Open DNS or I'm sorry my cloud Fair Docker image that then encrypts that DNS traffic and then sends it out into the world and so giving me better and on uh uh privacy on the internet while also bringing all that technology right to the router so I don't have to wait for for DNS responses on the internet uh we have several we have three platforms that we mentioned uh we have uh application and Docker so the application and Docker supported on many of our routers like the transit Duo Pro and the br2 pro 5G if you want KVM actual hypervisor support you need to have either an epx a 2500 EC an sdx Pro or an upgraded mvx if you have an mbx now don't don't freak out and go try this and then you help me that it doesn't work it does require uh storage and a license so the mbx can be upgraded to support uh hypervising hypervisor the sdx pro 2500 EC and epx have it all included deployment um so I'm gonna do I'm gonna do a live demo because I think that unless you have something else you want to add but I think it's showing it's going to be that deployment's kind of cool because that that was 10 years ago that we we did that and so that was a railway system and again so that was you know using the the balanced routers with with what we call Media fast at the time but we were basically powering that that entire um transit system display so people could see where the where the vehicle was when it was showing up what the next stops were but also delivering advertising content and you know in those days it required a whole bunch of programming to do all that stuff and that was fine this customer had those resources in-house but you know now with Docker and and being able to run different applications and containers the the various entry to this are so much lower and it's so much easier for companies and customers to be able to deploy really rich powerful local applications like this so yeah Peter dive on in and show us what you've built um yeah so for the for the proof of concept or the demo and I try to do demos and what was interesting I I I've been struggling for about four days on how to do a real-time demo because you know it's like these all these webinars I try to real time set this up applications and virtualization is not a quick process just the idea of deploying Windows Server can take you know 45 minutes to an hour of time and so uh it's gonna be like a cooking show where uh I've got stuff pre-built for you um and I'm gonna do the best I can to Deep dive it that being said I do have a YouTube video and I don't normally try to promote any of my channel stuff on the peplum University um but but I do have a YouTube video that I actually went through and um um went real time and went through deploying uh a hypervisor we're gonna do the same thing for Docker and we're gonna do the same thing for a python based application um but what I was I spent a lot and that's why I'm sort of juggling through this this demo a little bit more not so fluidly as I did because I really wanted I was so passionately invested in demo uh providing you guys a real-time demo um but due to how long it takes to deploy applications and deploy these services and configure them all it can't be done in one hour and and so I need so you're gonna you'll I'll have three one-hour segments that you can watch online uh with application Docker and hypervisor um and so the live demo is going to be showing you how I do it and the end result but not necessarily the step-by-step guide and so I do want to just preface that um so the first thing we did was the first thing we did was a Docker deployment and our original goal was to deploy a Docker SNMP agent um but the programming of the dashboard was not being done fast enough uh for the for the webinar and so uh Ben one of one of our new uh system Engineers over at West came with a great idea of demonstrating Docker with enhanced security a lot of rvers or mobile uh like like people that walk on mobile internet they're you know secure internet's an important thing having adware you know ads removed from your your content or having your DNS protected from the isps and things like that and so we thought how cool would it be to to demo basically a br2 pro 5G with secure internet like really decently secure internet um just out of the box and so um we spun up four VMS let me log into this router oops so here's my br2 Pro 5G I've got two uh two at T and um a USB hotspot connected so I'm going to go into my dashboard here there we go and if I go into my Advanced tab of the br2 profile G you'll see right here Edge Computing so if you're running 8.3 firmware you're going to have media fast has been now renamed Edge Computing right there which is really nice um in in the the transit Pro or the transit Duo Pro or the br2 pro 5G you can come in and you should have application and Docker so application allows us to deploy basically web web applications locally um and so I've created this content.westnetworks.com that should work for anybody that wants to go there um but we're caching it locally something that we have to do before if you're going to run any scripting is you have to go to system package manager and you want to make sure Python and Ruby are installed if you're using those as part of your web application so there's my python my Ruby and Python 3 which is not installed so I can click download and install python three three if I needed to but this installs the framework needed to run those applications so you do want to make sure if you're using application based um uh Edge Computing that they are either python or Ruby based if if you want them natively supported here on the uh the pepper once you have those installed you can go into your storage manager and you can allocate how your storage is used so I have my content Hub which is the application and I have my Dockers capabilities and so I you can see here that I've got a seven gigabyte uh available here on the br2 pro 5G I've got four Megs of free unallocated um 700 Megs is dedicated to my content Hub and about six gigs is dedicated to Docker I can format those partitions if I want to and then once you have your storage manager allocated and your packet package manager allocated I can then go into the advanced tab go to my application and right here I can click new website if I want to and with a new website I have oh I can do an HTTP website where I can do an application um and so you can choose if it's going to be using like python or Ruby or if this is just a regular HTTP or https website so once you do that I just added we just added the website content Dot westnetworks.com we put in the FTP URL username and password tell it how often to sync and hit save and apply once you do that you now have the website being pulled in and if I click on this little square right here it'll actually open a file manager within the peplink router so I can see the files that are syncing with the system so it's going to open a new tab with a little file manager it's going to show me all the files that are part of that website that it's downloaded and syncing also I can click this green button just to force it to sync right now um and then here I can click this to edit the current site settings or I can delete it um so on the br2 pro 5G and once again the complications of a real-time live demo is I'm broadcasting on the internet so I can't connect to a disconnected internet but I did test this last night um so I if I connect to this router the br2 pro 5G turn off my internet I can go to content.westnetworks.com and it's still load because this content which once again it's sort of like it's a little bit fake because of the real-time demo but this website that we that we set up for this demo loads on my br2 Pro 5G when I have zero internet so this this content is being cached locally so imagine a train or a bus service that maybe has a video server and they want to have like four or five videos they could have videos Dot their domain.com or content.westnowers.com and then I can have those videos cached right to the router I would say anything of a really cool idea that I could create a how-to guide on all the router like how to set up your router and then you just go to routersetup.com and then you have a little router video on how to set up your router and push to the to the peplink routers I just thought that would become a fun use case scenario that we could push to basically all the routers um once again I wish I could show you more but if I had to disconnect from the internet to show you and I and I do apologize but um that is really easy to set up though I mean that that's pretty much it the docker was a little bit more complicated to set up uh and Ben probably has a really good story we could tell about this um so Docker there's a three-step or two-step Park first you need when you running a Docker for the very first time you have to download the essential which basically activates Docker on the Linux core of the peplink router once you have Docker essential installed you can then click search right here in the search Docker images and I could you just search pie hole it's a really weird name by the way [Laughter] we've got jokes I'm just not gonna not gonna air out on the on the live webinar now the live webinar did I spell it wrong of course it's not gonna work for me right in a second but oh there we go so I can search the name of the image that I want to push and there's a big database of these images and there's lots of applications like you can think like security appliances web gateways antivirus gateways um can increase the the security validation of a peplink router so you can see right there there's pie hole pie hole click the download button and it's going to download that that image we did the same thing for cloud fair and so we downloaded that then you click this plus and you can put in the docker command to provision the server and so I've got these four servers here Pie Hole uh uh and Cloud fair and I am on a different router but I'm pretty sure I can go to 10.254 give me one second I did a virtual Nat on it so for I'm sorry guys there we go so then I can log into the this pie hole app this pie hole is running on the this might my br2 Pro 5G that is cool I so this system is right inside the peplink router with its own web UI and I actually have two of them in ha so you have uh uh 51 and 52. and if you notice just for anybody that was might be watching the the web the IP address is 192.168.50 but because I'm routing through speed Fusion and I don't want 192.168.50 to to conflict I actually am using what's called a one-to-one Nat it's a v-nap feature where I'm actually mapping 192.16850 but different subnets so it doesn't conflict with any other subnets that I have on my network which is why I just had to quickly grab it the 10.264.189 that allows me to access this on the Lan uh through speed Fusion if there's other routers on my network with a 192 168.50 um but here I can then see a dashboard see how much it's protecting my network what what sites are being uh going to on this router and I can configure my clients my groups my domains so it's a fully functioning containerized application running inside the VR2 Pro 5G um and then in the settings and DNS we changed it sorry I apologize um we were playing around last night I'm trying to get the the application to work but then we also have the other Docker application that is the cloud fair and so what we did is the cloud Fair application is 10.192168.50.253 and 254. so what we did is you go into settings DNS and we point the router the the pie hole to 253 and 254. this sends it to Cloud Fair which encrypts and secures my DNS queries so now if I if I'm you know a t and T-Mobile or anybody else isn't the wiser of my DNS traffic it's all being hosted right on side my br2 Pro 5G and once again I I think that's that's pretty cool that's uh like the fact that we just have this app running and the other thing is you get this kind of like memory utilization you can see the load of the system and active it's kind of now let's see if I can zoom in a little bit for you but you can see there's there's a lot of reporting that we're getting on the DNS um which is once again you know adds a lot of functionality um before I move to hypervisor are there any questions about Docker I know we normally take questions at the end but because we're doing a whole bunch are there do we want to address any questions are there any questions about Docker application before we move on to um before we move on to KVM I don't see any Docker specific questions there's one about in control there we go Catherine are there any limits to the size of the docker applications so that goes into the storage on the router um so that's why we go the storage manager the the br2 pro 5G has a built-in seven gigabyte partition for this capability um I I don't want to mistake this but I know that it's either coming or available but we can add USB storage yeah certain models were looking at ways that we can add USB storage as well so yeah um yeah it's not everywhere yet but I know that we have an MDX capability with a special firmware that allows to allow USB storage so basically instead of a USB hotspot I could have a USB storage connected to it and increase the storage capabilities but that's not publicly available on all on on the routers yet I do know what's we're working on it though yeah we'll see which models that that's capable on and you know which um you know which virtualization options that's compatible with but yeah definitely we want to expand that capability on devices that have those those Hardware support or they have that power support and the and and fourth and you can see right there actually the br2 eight gigs and the transit Duo has eight gigs uh comes with them the 2500 EC has one terabyte comes with it the sdx pro looks like it has three different models I guess maybe based on firmware uh hardware version but you have 501 terabyte and two terabyte the epx comes with a terabyte and the mvx you can get a 512 gig but once again not built in so you have to have a license for that um any other questions about Docker application before we go to kbm the only question that's lingering out there and I think this will apply to any of these but just the ic2 side of it you know what capabilities exist from the in control side to provision these so far um as far as I know none yet right yeah yeah yeah we're managing all these locally and there are a couple downsides one uh which I did last uh last night I factory reset my my uh my epx to create the KVM because I wanted to go through settings and it deleted all the data on it as well so I had to re-upload my server image um so there are there are potential downside like make sure you have backups of your applications or at least you have configuration backups um so you just be aware of that um but I think that would be a limitation of any uh router based hypervisor or application because once again it's syncing right so like this website in the docker this website that we're syncing is stored on an FTP server and then I'm pushing it to my Edge so it's sort of already backed up anyways you just have to reconfigure it and then the docker images they're just appliances with the you know with configurations once again that are syncing so you just have to re-push them out um if you were to get a new device but I don't think there's any configuration in control yet correct yeah again this is this is where we're looking for feedback you know what are what are features that you would like to see on that side you know are there examples of a similar provisioning system that you've used that works well um you know we know that there's other options out there in terms of centralized Edge Computing and so we want to see what what folks like and what works for people and um and I do like I said I have a step-by-step guide um that I'm gonna release for this I I once again it took several hours and um so I I feel bad that you guys don't get to watch this live but I do have a step-by-step guide um that Ben helped me create or been created for for these this particular application and so we will we will create a YouTube video just for this and re and release it for you um that way you can watch exactly how to do it because that's one of the things with this video series I want to do is make sure you know exactly how to implement these Technologies and so I did the best I could in the time frame of this webinar uh but we will release a full step-by-step guide as well with all the commands and everything um so the last feature um in the edge Computing is is hypervisor um and for that I'm using an epx because once again the br2 pro 5G doesn't support hypervisor KVM support um and so the same type of processor so here's my epx the first thing you're gonna do is go to system and storage manager and you got to make sure you provision storage so here the epx if you notice I've got media fast because that's content caching now uh content Hub which is the application Docker and then KVM and so you can see my KVM I've got a a one terabyte ish SSD right there uh in the epx and soft provision my storage and formatted it uh you can go to your package manager and download packages if you're going to do the application but I don't have any on there and I don't have anything configured for that um and then you can see right here external storage uh so external storage is supposed to allow that USB storage and access of it um so there is capabilities coming down the line that's going to allow to to extend that on some of the devices um then once you you provision your storage you go to Advanced and I can go to my KVM and you turn it on that's it turn it on hit apply changes once you do that this little tiny line is going to show up here down here at the bottom it's kind of misleading it's almost looks like a subtext right click here to open the file manager you can click here and it's going to open that same file manager that we saw earlier with the uh when I open my content Hub and here's my image Windows Server 2022 and then here's my KVM VM that I created a lot of people uh the next step is a can be confusing because it is a hypervisor platform this runs on KVM so you use a Linux machine with virtual machine manager so I I installed virtualbox because I figured a lot of people like that I was gonna do hyper-v but I wanted something more universally support uh uh appreciated I guess so I I have a virtual box here that I installed at Ubuntu and I've got a Ubuntu machine um so in my Ubuntu machine I went to the app store downloaded virtual machine manager and clicked file add connection when you add connection the connection is going to be uh I'll do it right here add connection custom URL and I don't know if you can see this I apologize this might be small but it's um and this is in my YouTube video but it's q-e-m-u plus TCP colon forward slash forward slash the IP address of the epx so in my case 192.168.10.1 forward slash system once you do that you click connect you put in the IP or the admin name and password of the epx's uh UI and that's going to pop up right here then you can click new VM you can choose your local media that you that I up so I uploaded this um Windows Server I just drag and dropped it into the file manager once it's there I can say local media click next and then hit browse and there's my my ISO right there right on the epx and you can see there's my my drive I hit choose volume and it's going to scan for the OS if you just type in server 2022 or whatever it is that you're I mean there's a bunch of I mean you could run anything you want here um click next give it some Ram and you can see here it tells you that you have up to 16 gigs available and up to eight processors so um that's what's on the epxl available for you it's important here that if you suck up all the resources on the epx the epx will no longer be a 40 gigabit router it'll be a less than 40 gigabrowser because some of the resources are being used uh for virtualization so any virtualization even on the docker you are going to be consuming CPU and memory that would otherwise go to Performance so if you're adding if you overload it with too much stuff Docker or hypervisor you are consuming resources click next um give it a storage capacity click next and then give it a name and this is these next two steps are really important customized configuration before install you want to check that device name this is your ethernet connection it's br0 that's really important otherwise you're not connecting it to the the appropriate bridge for the untagged land and this will be connecting on the untagliner so then I can click finish it's going to open up the configuration guide we want to remove console one under display v and C we want to say address and all interfaces and apply under video VGA we want to change this to virto and have apply changes and then you click begin install when you click begin install it's going to actually load up uh your your virtual machine it's going to build the virtual machine load it up start the Windows installation all right cancel install and then you'll get a VM that is running this so this is a Windows Server box running on um yeah running on my epx I can terminal server right into it so if I do mstsc ope so there she is running right inside so now you can run like Nexus you can run an SNMP agent you can run you know you can like a lot of people want to do logging well if you have an epx with a terabyte of data or an sdx Pro with a terabyte data you could install an SNMP logging tool right or a any kind of sim logging tool pull all your routers logs right into this agent um and you have one terabyte of storage to do so um and so it's kind of kind of neat the Opera I mean the options here are virtually endless because it's a it's a hypervisor platform one a couple of the things that we did one we demoed at um at the public Tech Summit was actually using Nexus to do uh the monitoring of the network equipment uh one of uh one of my other clients is playing around with using it as read-only domain controller so basically faster authentication and and DNS for branch locations um so the options here are pretty pretty useful um because it's it's a I mean it's a Windows box running inside of and it's not slow I mean this is running this epx is running on two HD one domes and that's how I'm connecting to it I did all of this over the HD one domes I have two HD1 domes with uh internet connectivity and the site I mean and it it works just fine so I mean that's I I know it's over simplification of the process but now once you have that set up it's it's up and running so now let's talk about some of the downsides then um so KVM management right now inside peplink inside the epx is that right there which means there's no status no start and stop no provisioning um and so you need to have a uh an Ubuntu or some sort of Linux manager with virtual machine manager I know Ben and I are playing around with the idea of actually doing a Docker Ubuntu machine that'll run right on the epx that we can then have then we can have a machine manager right on side the other thing I want to look into is can we run like a a uh uh basically a con a package manager like to to run the uh to run the virtual machine manager so the idea is is there any way to bring that virtual machine manager right into the epx without having to install um another operating system or to have that management um if the router reboots if the epx reboots the machines will not start on reboot um so you'll have to load your virtual machine manager and um click run so those are the current uh downsides that I currently have in it that I'm hoping will get improved in future firmware but like Travis always says in these videos that's what that's what they're they're here for and to provide our feedback and so the more we deploy these Technologies and use them and the more feedback we provide to peplink the more powerful these features become and you know running Windows or any operating system on uh on a router is not a novelty there's a lot of you know valid business reasons for doing this you know we see harsh environments where our devices are are certified and backed for these harsh environments and then adding a PC to that environment is is difficult in some cases and you know next to Impossible in other cases and so and we have Railway customers National Railway systems that are running Windows on the on these trains and doing all sorts of customized Telemetry applications we have video surveillance customers running you know video management software systems on on these routers digital digital nvrs and also go ahead we have a memo customer um so we have a mobile mammography customer that um their their the hospital was bought by another hospital and then the the new hospital that bought them would not allow any external connections into the hospital at all and the customer was heartbroken because they have this you know epx solution with all these internet connections trying to do real-time mobile mammography and and so the only option at that point even though they had this epx with all the connectivity was to drive back to the facility and go back to like you know the early 2000s you had to plug in with an Ethernet line and then it would go to a proxy machine because I asked I asked the I.T security I said well then at the hospital how do they transmit the images to you and they go we have a proxy so if you connect back to the hospital you can connect to that proxy it'll it'll send the images to the proxy which will then route through the cloud into our system and we can store it in our packs and I said is that a virtual machine and they said yes I said can we just install the proxy on the bus and they go huh I don't know and I was like it's just a virtual machine right yeah and I was like so what if we install it on the bus and so I got them in contact with one of my texts Josh grimmel Josh deployed the proxy software VM on the S on the epx we use speed Fusion connect to bond the traffic out to the cloud and now the X-ray machine sends to the proxy appliance which goes out through speed Fusion connect doesn't touch the hospital Network at all and goes right into their pack system and it's all because we have virtualization Edge based virtualization capabilities to run this proxy and so you know absolutely amazing use case of the technology yeah that's that's that's super cool and yeah there's more simplistic stuff too you know just iot Telemetry you know these devices that spew all kinds of data all day every day right you don't want to just stream that live to the cloud you can use lightweight application but the edge process that data pick out the anomalies the important things run some simple functions on that and you can use that in conjunction with other cloud-based iot platforms so you know Azure and AWS both have iot specific systems and services on there and so they have lightweight images that you can use in conjunction with those so that you can again get that hybrid cloud and Edge experience so lots of capabilities lots of possibilities out there but again we're all ears here so we've got a lot of capabilities now but we know that there's more refinements to do here and more more features we can add to make this a lot more useful and using InTouch you can just Connect into all these VM applications right built into the in the pathlink ecosystem so one one ecosystem to rule them all I mean that's a great point right if you've got these virtual machines running there yeah now you can get right into those that way as well yeah um I so um like I said we we already have the uh installing Windows server on KVM um I'll work with Ben and we'll release the docker one and then we'll also relieve the release the content Hub step-by-step guide uh like I said I do apologize normally I want to have those going on our webinars but due to the amount of time it takes it was just not not possible I uh I went through the process like five times trying to make it fit in one hour and it just wasn't gonna work um do we have any questions Travis I'm typing some answers out here I know there's an a request for a sub one thousand dollar device that will support the full hypervisor option um because Hardware is the the limitation there you need an Intel x86 CPU to be able to achieve that and so maybe um not not today but you know I I think we're there's models in our lineup that are close to that so that's not I mean when the sdx becomes near end of life you could probably buy one used and yes I mean you know CPUs are getting cheaper and so you know it's possible but it's not today is the the short answer on that unfortunately I say that the closest you're going to get is the transit Duo Pro with Docker right um and and then and then I mean there are Docker images of Windows Server there's Docker images of Ubuntu so I mean you can get a lightweight virtualization using containers and Docker so the the real the real answer to that is not full full-blown hypervisor but with Docker I mean that that gets really close yeah and I guess the the question is what are you trying to accomplish right what what happens are you trying to run and yeah maybe there's another way to do it but yeah regardless we want to have those conversations and you know whether that's on the Forum or directly those I think we definitely want to dig into more and just understand what what the requirements are out there and what people are trying to do and you know requirements Drive New models with peplink right we if we hear that there's a real need out there for a device that does something just slightly different um that's something we're always willing to at least investigate another question will Docker restart automatically after a reboot yes yeah yeah so um yeah I've rebooted this a number of times and it comes right back up and running so and Docker this is what I would love to see in the KVM right when we add a when we add a VM having it show up it would be awesome if under the KVM this showed up with all your your VMS and you could start and stop them um but in Docker they all automatically start back up um and you can start stopping delete them and you can even because it's a container based you can even add new ones so like for example this this pie hole I can actually click that and then paste in the command to create another VM and it'll just Loop that up and assign it so on the KVM side if you use like a virtual machine manager you can set that automatically start on boot option is that something that actually okay you know there's probably something yeah I've tried I've tried a few different things with that unfortunately with the way that the the the virtual machine manager at least in all my testing um that I've done you just have to you just have to come in here and click run it's off like I said one of the one of the things that Ben and I are trying to do is spin up a Docker Ubuntu with vmm so that way you have that ability to manage the router right right natively in the router quickly well it seems like there's at least one feature request already coming out of this webinar so that's great yeah folks again feedback marketing at peplink.com or Forum forum.public.com Peter West networks Professor p is always always here to answer questions too so we'll save you some give you guys back 10 minutes of your time then today um and if there's uh anything you need Travis at peplink Peter at westnetworks and we'd be and if you have feature requests or have any use cases on this or scenarios I love telling stories so if you're using this for for something neat or want to use it for something neat let us know we'd love to work with you on that um the the ability to to empower the community with these projects is why we're here so thank you yeah thank you folks take care and we'll see you again in a month have a good one bye"}

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "hey folks Travis Derek here with peplink we've got another one of our peplink University Series webinars today for you as always we've got Professor P here to show us the way and today we're going to talk about the speed Fusion Connect app this is a new app that we've been working on and I think it's going to be really interesting and exciting for you folks to see how this works and what you can do with this and I guess with that Peter I'm going to hand it over to you yes give me one second I accidentally bought something up here okay yeah so um if you don't know me my name is Peter West um otherwise known as Professor p and um I excited to do this next uh webinar on the speed Fusion Connect app um I've got my phone connected uh with Dex so I'm hoping this works well so I kind of got my phone connected right there so I'm uh if you see weird text notifications that is my phone so I apologize in advance the um but let's talk about the speed Fusion Connect app why we made it um let's go over some of the limitations and why we think it's valuable for different customers so does that work Travis yeah I think oh great yeah so the speed Fusion Connect app has been made in order to simplify the management of peplink routers and more of a Soho SMB environment I think for a lot of people like in control just doesn't make sense right if you're an end user maybe an RV or you're just a small business owner and you've got one or two locations like this Cloud management thing is just way too much for you and so there's too many features yes right on your smartphone simplified that's really the focus here and so the speed Fusion Connect app allows you to create Wi-Fi networks see your lands see your lands update your protect data add LTE data manage your network see your users get up reports um and control which apps or devices can use speed Fusion protect and so um it's it's a really nice user interface uh I I've I've been playing with it um so I have my my ubr plus right here and um this is my personal uh hotspot that I use and I've been using the speed Fusion uh connect protect and speed Fusion app to uh to configure this for a couple weeks now I'm just trying to get it uh you know make sure I was happy with it before doing this presentation and I'm really impressed with the the friendliness and user interface that this provides um yeah it's really just the core right yeah get connected protect what you care about yeah we'll let you keep going yeah like I was saying it just strips it down to the basics the things that people really need right just get yourself connected right you can add an LTE plan over the air with the esim you can get you know get your Wi-Fi network set up and secured and then you can protect the things that you care about and you know check on usage and see see who's doing what and again it's just all about those things that matter the most to to those folks who don't have a thousand devices to manage exactly or if you don't have even if you have a thousand I mean or just that you don't need the advanced features that in control offers right in control is very feature Rich right we have vlans we have Network route settings now with with new uh 2.12 we have um you know uh captive portal settings we have advanced reporting speed Fusion configuration and so if you're using a peplink router as uh for for Speed Fusion connect protect and you're looking to simplify your deployment of your branch sites or your your retail locations it's a great tool to do this um and so um it's really easy to set up um and we're gonna live do that with my 20x I'm I'm hoping this is going to go well um but we're gonna live set up the 20x um with the app here in a few minutes but the setup is easy you add the device you set up your your network you enable your speed Fusion uh connect protect locations and you set up how you want to use that speech using connect protect and so I think that um I think most people will see how easy it is addition with the Wi-Fi you can create a guest Network and a private Network um and supposedly which we're going to try you can now do speed fusion um sfc relay is my understanding and so if we have enough time today I'm actually going to try that ad hoc uh without ever actually doing it so it'll be kind of fun if we have enough time yeah I want to take just a minute to kind of explain some of these terms quick too because I think there's a little bit of confusion sometimes it's not always clear exactly what these things are and so you know speed Fusion connect protect that's you know if you've got multiple internet connections right or maybe you just have one but you've got your your landline or whatever your connection is you can add another connection and then you can protect your traffic and so speed Fusion connect protect is the cloud side of speed Fusion so peplink's hosting that letting you prioritize which applications matter and get that stuff protected and then on the other side we've got speed Fusion connect 5G LTE so you can add an LTE or 5G service to your device without having to go to a store or get a SIM card right we can do that all over the air even if you already have a SIM card in your router you can add another one so if you have Verizon you can add a t if you have a t you can add T-Mobile or if you have T-Mobile you can have Verizon right you can add any other connection you want so that you've got that safety net you've got that extra layer of of backup so that you can protect those applications if you're primary or preferred carrier has an issue so those are kind of those two terms that I think help to really understand what all of these uh how this all comes together and you might hear me thank you for that uh Travis and you might hear me say sfc or speed Fusion connected depends on my verbiage but sfc is speed Fusion connect and that's sort of the overall umbrella of this Cloud hosted services from peplink so if you hear speed Fusion connect or sfc what they're referring to is hey this is provided by peplink right peplink provided LTE peplink provided 5G peplink provided bonding um and so um that's really where this sfc comes in so now you have the sfc app right the manager of these sfc Technologies and your routers foreign with the sfc protect you can easily manage uh protect your devices and applications with speed Fusion built in right into the app and Publix made it super easy to do this um and you can actually customize how it's being done so if you notice here you can go into your speed Fusion settings and you have a series of apps like Zoom you can choose your zoom and you can say standard Jitter free or Express and so um jitterfree is going to add Wan smoothing right and so it's going to use parity bits and so it's going to take your cable modem if you have that connected like a 20x and then the the speed the sfc LTE and it's going to add land smoothing this means your your Zoom connection is going to be more resilient and reliable because you're not you have that extra parity bits that are happening over that that LTE or 5G connection um and so you can select apps that you want to use specifically over sfc protect to be able to make those those apps run better or be more resilient and you don't uh Travis and I did a webinar a couple months ago where we talked about the different ways to configure outbound policies and I mentioned that one of my favorites is just sending all the traffic over speed fusion um that can be not the best way for example Netflix doesn't like vpns um and so you might not want to run that um all the time or if you're bonding with starlink for example starlink bursts data so you might not want to run your high performance downloads where you're going to have a really fast Starling download over over speed Fusion can't protect but you might want to run Zoom so that way it's more resilient with um starlink and 5G um and so it's nice to know that you can customize this very simply within the app um three we have 28 cities and 19 countries protected which means not only can you have peace of mind that you're going to be reliably connected you can actually choose where you want to present yourself if I want to present myself in Europe I can just choose a European location if I need to if I'm in uh if I'm traveling around Europe and my VPN or my uh my work wants me to to show that I'm coming from the USA I can choose a U.S location um and and actually have that a customer asked me that they said hey I'm traveling on on a trip but my work blocks other countries they do Regional blocking and my VPN has to come from America so easy you just use sfc choose one of our uh multiple uh Us locations and when you establish your ipsec tunnel it'll actually go right over and it'll look like it's coming from the USA additionally I've been told that starlink doesn't play well with vpns well you can actually bond starlink to sfc protect to any one of these locations then put your VPN through it and it will work your ipsec VPN or your your dmvpn will connect right through that that speed Fusion uh tunnel and so it's a really neat way to kind of circumvent maybe other blocks uh if you might want to say that and right here we just uh we're kind of going in more advanced avoid location-based restrictions with with uh relay mode relay mode we announced in the 8.3 kind of had mixed feelings about how it was deployed and are really finding great use cases for it um so I have a 20x right here connected to a br2 pro 5G not in Synergy mode um using it as kind of like a a weird internet source that's not there's no status public IP and so I can I can have this sitting here take this over to to Europe relay through here and then come out through my cable modem so the idea is you put a 20x at your house you connect it to your cable modem you can then relay mode uh Transit duo or a ubr plus back to that 20x and it'll look like you're coming from your your cable provider this is going to help with uh launching your ESPN app or your your internet app or your uh your cable provider app um because or Netflix and things like that because it's going to look like it's coming from your IP um and so it's a great way to extend your network um without a whole bunch of complicated infrastructure yeah I think this is a big problem for anybody who travels right the rvers out there right like okay you've got this pep link and you can protect all your traffic now with speed Fusion but you know again like you said these these Services block vpns right they don't want people cheating and coming in from different countries when they're not actually from there right and so now you can actually travel on the road you've got your peplink with multiple connections but then those Services see you right back at your home right you're on that cable modem it's a it's a clean IP address and so you've got that bonding speed Fusion experience on the road but again you've got that home experience at the same time so you really get the best and I use this every day I mean if anybody follows me on on social media I travel for work all the time um and this technology allows me to keep connected um eat reliable teams calls when I'm traveling but also be able to just watch Netflix or or uh you know Hulu or whatever I don't want to keep saying Netflix that's not fair to the other providers but you know any streaming provider it lets me stay connected to those even though I'm over cellular or starlink and I get that nice reliable connection and it's very pleasant um four with speed Fusion the sfc app you can now monitor your data usage and land quality so instead of having to log into in control with complicated reports which I think are really easy don't want to put down in control but easier so uh you know these the report generation is now right in the palm of your hand so once again allowing you to easily see how much data you're consuming um and and maybe who your top consumers are and things like that and so it allows you to to get visibility into your utilization and a lot of times travels I don't know about you but I get a lot of support calls where they're like oh my internet's so slow and it's because they're running a throttled SIM card and yeah and it's because they're not paying attention to how much data they're using and so a lot of times when we have these throttled SIM cards um it's misleading on the performance that you might get I'm gonna be right back sorry yeah I was this person last week I've maxed out a shared plan and I didn't realize it you know I I'm exactly this person last week I I had a support call just yesterday and the customer is really really upset about and actually loaded sfc LTE on it because I they only have one sim card so I just it was a 20x I loaded LT uh sfc LTE connected it to Verizon the same SIM card carrier he had and it was you know get 180 megabits per second whoa and I was like yeah you're you're it's throttle it's not it's you know the carriers they tell you it's unlimited but sometimes it's not um and I don't want to get in that conversation here but it's really neat to be able to pull up and see your utilization so you know what's going on uh five sfc LTE and 5G data right from the app now it'll launch the e-store you can kind of see that it's gonna you're gonna select a plan and it's gonna launch the e-store automatically connected to your serial number and lets you uh purchase this data and I am going to attempt this today um but uh we'll see what happens now it's put here if you ever I don't know if you've seen my my 310 5G uh uh kind of uh commercial and my 20x commercial with Bob's ice cream store and Sarah's Law Firm um but this is an amazing technology and I'll tell you why if you have a cable modem and you're at your house or even at your business your retail location Etc and you don't want to spend 50 to 100 a month for a backup service that you might or might not need just to have it there with sfc LTE and 5G you buy 10 gigs or 100 gigs of data and it's just there there's no monthly fee no contract and so your cable modem fails or your fiber line fails or your internet whatever it might be fails and boom that LTE data is there being used you can monitor with the reporting and then you can reload it and so instead of of paying monthly for service that you don't necessarily want because you have fast cable or FiOS or fiber or whatever you can be protected without the extra expense and but I was a little hesitant when peplink first launched this feature it is an amazing feature that we've we've helped tons of customers with that want back up and don't want to pay that monthly fee um and so if you've never looked at this or played with it if you have any modern peplink router it's going to support this um uh so I would highly advise him I mean play with it um but Travis I don't know if you have anything more to say I know this is my sales pitch on uh on sfc 5G but it's pretty cool yeah I think you know the whole concept of backup LTE or backup 5G makes sense to people right away but like you said it's like the devil's in the details all of a sudden's like oh I have to spend 20 50 a month for that thing that I don't even know if I'm gonna use it this year right like yeah maybe I will maybe I won't but oh my gosh the day that I needed wow I need it now right because I'm Bob's ice cream shop and I've got 15 people in line and my internet just went down and you know I'm Bob I'm not at the ice cream shop because I'm out buying supplies or whatever but you know my store employees can call me and say hey the internet's down I can't run credit cards and I can come on here push a few buttons and boom I have a backup connection over the air within a minute or two like that's powerful or hopefully automatically right hopefully you've already pre-loaded it and so it's sitting there ready to go yep yeah you can do it from anywhere you don't have to be there you don't have to put a SIM card in as long as you've got the antennas hooked up you're ready for that backup whenever you need to push that button that's exactly right the sfc app does not work on every router yet um and so it's really designed for the the uh the the the the Soho SMB um uh routers that that are really volume purchased and or used for these backup connections so the 20x one of my favorite routers the ubr plus another one of my favorite routers um the br1s uh the mini the pro 5G the pro ltea the br2 pro which I have right there um and the transit Duo Pro all support the uh the sfc app AppLink is officially putting this into a Insider preview slash beta uh right now so we're looking for feedback um so we we'd love it if you jump on this app uh download it download it register yourself in the Forum um as a beta tester and um and provide feedback of what features do we need like the you and I've mentioned this in other conversations if you've been watching these this series with Travis and myself but Evelyn really does care about the feedback that we provide as as users of their technology and so um it's a great opportunity to provide insight and make this app really usable for um you know the community it's probably the best way to say it um and so um I know that I've already had like three or four of my customers my Enterprise customers hey why is the mbx and it's like it's in beta right now so we're kind of making sure that it's gonna work and and then we can add more products but right now we don't want you to do that we don't want to you know your production environment for your large Enterprise don't go download this app and add it uh it does interact with in control I'll show you that in a few minutes when we do the live demo um but really you know grab your grab your hotspot device grab your RV router your home router um play around with it and make sure you understand how it works and how it interoperates um and if you're using regular speed Fusion if you're going from your corporate office to a branch office um you do not want to use this yet there's no speed Fusion configuration it's all sfc protect and SSL LTE so you want to keep using in control if you're using speed Fusion uh on your devices [Music] um public recommends downloading the app doing a backup of your uh your active configuration um uh before uh adding the device and then um and then provide feedback uh so I'm gonna jump into a demo on this real fast um or hopefully uh and um we'll we'll go over it so I've got let me pull up my decks here um a second yeah and while you're pulling that up I'll just you know on the feedback side if you take a screenshot on your phone our app automatically recognizes that and you can mark it up you can highlight where the problem is you can put some notes in there and then you click that submit button so you don't have to like send us you know an email attachment it's going to automatically push all that information to us and it's going to give us a little bit of Diagnostics in the background too so this is the fastest most efficient way to get a problem solved and get get your direct feedback in there and get things improved and so yeah definitely just do that screenshot and it's an automatic process and it's pretty straightforward my deck's messed up on me I apologize um that's the first time I've used yeah we're live right um so when you download the app I've got the sfc connect right here so I'm going to double click that you will log on log in using um uh put your peplink ID if you need to uh one thing to note that I really liked is under users you can actually invite other users into this platform and actually share devices with them so if you have five or six devices like you can actually invite users and assign them to a device like hey this is uh my home router I mean by my wife or partner whoever to that device um so if I go to router this is my uh my ubr plus and so I can see right here I've got two Cellular Connections zero wired connections nothing's plugged into my land zero wired lens and I've got one Wi-Fi so I've already added this device this is like I said device I've been playing with so I've got my sfc protect I've got what a little over a terabyte left um and so if I click on Wan you'll see there's my wired Wan and I've connected to Verizon and at T in a Sim slot if I click on one of these like when a cellular Lan one I can change my APN and I can also select a different carrier obviously if I have a Verizon sim and I select ATT it's not going to work but this is really important for sfc protect or sfc LTE data because if you connect with if you have sfc LTE you can then choose which carrier you want it to be on ATT T-Mobile or Verizon um and so it's kind of neat there um click back uh let me go to the wired one if I click on my wired Wan um I can actually set my IP settings here so Dynamic IP PPO EIP or static IP so if you think about this for out-of-band management for like a retail or small retail or branch location you can have sfclte data online connecting this type in your your carrier IP address hit save and now you've got ethernet with backup LTE and so really nice feature set it's very easy I mean if you can see on the screen it's very easy to it's clean and easy to navigate and makes a lot of sense as far as the UI is concerned in my opinion um then so I've got my router settings I can go to My Lan and see my My Lan connected devices if I plug something in on the Lan and then on the Wi-Fi I can create Wi-Fi networks so I've got my uh ubr plus this is really cool uh if you click on the VR code QR code here right there you can scan this with your phone now I mean you guys could but you're not within range you can scan this with your code uh with your phone and actually connect to my ubr plus so if you're trying to share Wi-Fi at an event or a venue or at your house RV whatever instead of giving somebody your password you can just say hey scan this and so it's kind of neat uh feature there you can also create new Wi-Fi and I can create a guest Network um and you have an SSID and password and I can go and I can turn on and off 2.4 and 5 gigahertz um so the guest Network's gonna gonna protect your land uh the private Network's gonna make it available on your land um uh sfc protect right here if I click on this I can then choose what what plans I want so I can I can purchase more sfc protect data if I need to or I can purchase sfc connect um uh 5G and LTE with protect So when you buy the 5G data you also get the protect and so I can select a plan and and bundle those together which when I plug in my 20x you'll see me do it um then you can select our Cloud so once we have our Network set up we have our Wi-Fi setup we know uh we have our Internet connected now we can select our connection location so mine currently is auto I like that feature um if you're only having one because I'm gonna I travel a lot and so whenever I turn on the router it's going to connect to the closest lowest um uh ping time location which is kind of nice instead of just picking the closest geo location it'll actually pick the closest lowest ping time location um and so I really I really like that but if you wanted to you could select um multiple connections you can have up to three or Auto and I like Auto um and so that's pretty easy so once you select and so you see we start on the left and we're just going working our way right so I've I've configured my internet connection I've configured my Wi-Fi now I've selected my cloud location and now I can figure how it's going to be used um I can send a device over speed Fusion so I can say hey my uh my Asus fold send it over uh send it over which you can see that it already is right so if I connect my ASUS fold to this wi-fi network it's going to go out Miami uh which is my sfc protect or I can select application so for example like teams and zoom and WebEx are going to Route out those out sfc protect but for example if you see Office 365 says select I'm not routing that that's just going to go off the internet so life-size team zoom and WebEx are all going to be bonded and protected um and then other applications are just going to use my whatever the fast or whatever internet is available so it's going to be load balanced um and so continue to work to our right then I have my app my Wan quality and data usage so I can monitor the quality of my internet connections um you can see my Verizon is not great right now let's see if our cellular or at T is also not great right now it's okay um I got two of them bonded together so it still works well for me um and then I have my data usage and so you can pull up your your devices uh data usage by device or application and so you can see like almost like a peplink uh router UI like go to network and we just work our way down on the network tab you know Wan Lan you know get it connected set up the VPN set up our outbound policies it's working almost the same way we start with our router we choose our Cloud location choose our speed how we want to use speed fusion um then we have reports and users and so um it's really easy to work in the environment here so I'm going to I love those when quality reports Peter because I I think so often people just don't understand why why is this not working right why is my video so bad and you go look at your wired internet connection right I've got a gigabit Comcast connection I've got a gigabit Time Warner like why is my zoom in team so terrible well you can see like the literacy is garbage yeah you can start to see like oh yes my speedtest.net might be fast but you can see those differences is there and really understand and identify what the problem is then so I have in control I have a group called sfc app and then I've got my two devices and you see the sfc ubr plus has a lock what devices did disabled configuration from in control so if I click on this right there config locked on device sfc app manage so in in control I can still see this device I can still see that it's connected to Verizon and ATT um there's my tunnel my tunnels that it creates automatically when I choose Auto chose Auto um but it's locking the configuration and so I want to go to settings remote web admin I just want to show you what this looks like when it's when it's also locked because it also restricts some of the features so if you're using the sfc app if you notice you're going to have a much more restricted view here so if you ever logged into your router and go man where's all my settings most likely you're being managed by by the sfc app um and you can see lot you're logged in as a read-only user so they don't want you to make changes to the router they want you to use the app and so they've done a really good job of allowing you to use in control to see this route or to visualize the router manage its warranty and status and in control but allow users access to that device to be configured in the sfc app and so it's uh really nice at least I like it um so what I'm going to do now is I'm gonna oh go ahead I think this opens up the door for other use cases too like you said earlier maybe I am that company that has a whole bunch of these and and routers and I have just a lot of different customers right I want each customer to have that kind of self-service control and visibility well I can give them that app but I can still see things centrally and in control and still kind of have my view over here and so you can the two can coexist in a you know that's not going to be the same exact feature experience on the in control side but again you can have that kind of uh I see Great Value in the MSP um Marketplace here for the sfc app giving users access to their devices without without releasing full control um yeah it's a lot like that home you know wired Broadband experience right like these cable companies give you an app often with that modem that comes with your your service but you know you know they've got another way to manage that stuff on their side too and so again it's the user and the administrator can each have their their different places to go in correct okay so I'm going to show you I'm going to add my my 20x and I'm actually going to buy um sfclte on it so we're gonna I will pause it when I put a credit card um so I'm gonna hit Plus you could scan a serial number if you have a um if you uh have your camera and your your box or I can enter it manually so I'm just going to enter it right here next validated the serial number so now it's gonna ask me to stuff a Wi-Fi name so I'm going to say sfc app 20x you get a generic password because I'm sharing my screen here click next I could rename the router balance20x is fine maybe I'll just add like home to it hit start and your router is currently managed in control you need to change the configuration control to speed Fusion Connect app on your router so I need to tell the router not to manage or sell in control not to manage this router so I'm going to go to 20x click edit right here configuration control in control I'm going to uncheck that and hit save then go back to my app and if you haven't added this router to in control this step won't show up correct yeah if you if the router is not in control that won't show up let me uh there we go and so it's going to start provisioning this device um now inside you can see it's online here um sfc protect is already enabled so now I've got two routers here I've got my my ubr plus and my 20x which is uh you can see my 20x has uh 500 gigs of available bandwidth so I can click on this now and so here's my so the 20x supports sfclte if you notice that the ubr just had sfc protect the 20x has this sfc LTE option so I can click view plans sorry and it's going to open up the e-store and I can then buy a plant so I can click on this plan hit add to cart and check out oh okay give me one second guys I'm going to pause this for a second it is still paused I don't know yeah I'm just waiting to make sure it loaded I apologize said please offer some time for to take effect so we'll see what happens there so resume okay so I went I went in I hit pay it said please return the app and it says wait wait some time so I don't know what that means it said sometime um so we'll see what happens here the um but so then if you notice also here on this homepage it says hey there's an upgrade available so I can click on this and it's saying hey we recommend you running you run 8.30s033 do you want to upgrade now or schedule it so you could schedule this for when it's when when it's not being utilized um in your environment or if you're available you can upgrade now we're obviously not gonna do that right now um so I can also now choose my cloud location for bonding so you'll see here the first time it says Hey speed Fusion makes your connection unbreakable and protects the quality of video calls and applications which we kind of already explained and click next let you know that you can do cellular and white wired Wan together hit close it says you want to connect your location so I hit next um speed Fusion protect you can now protect your applications click next to guide you through this standard day-to-day web browsing jitter-free video and conferencing Express File Transfer that's going to be bonding right so hit next um configure devices or no I have no devices plugged into the network right now so then click Start and so now it's gonna it's this one shows Atlanta and you can see that it's right now in Cloud notes like guide you through it and I find it's very it's kind of I can try to see like my mom or someone trying to set this up and being a little confusing confused by it but for most people that are that that are buying a peplink router and know what the value of the peplink router is with bonding and cellular backup I feel like it's it's pretty straightforward that what we're doing is making this app user friendly to be able to to program these options um then I can go to speed fusion um usually your applications are now protected by speed Fusion protect hit start you can see that it automatically added these applications and set it up for me um and it says speed Fusion protection is ineffective two two-wan connections are required so top up your data so I'm hoping here shortly that it'll do that by by showing you this um yeah and so once Peter made that purchase that's an e Simmons so that's going to get pushed over the air automatically to that device but it does take a little bit of time usually a handful of minutes is all but so once that actually shows up yeah so we should we should see that show up soon so now that I have two routers support supposedly we can set up relay but yeah I'm not sure once again this is the very first time I've ever done this one um so I'm not sure where that feature is uh if you go to the cloud location it's at the bottom there oh there you go share router as a pure node so there we go so I can actually so under Cloud location where chose our our public locations I share routers peer so I can select this share my network share my peers fit edit turn on pure uh pure code uh peer Network it's going to generate a sharing code and then I should be able to connect the ubr to this with the sharing code we could answer some questions real fast while we're waiting to see if that loads up and stuff we have a I think we have a handful let's see here the standard recording question anybody who registered will get a recording of this email automatically um it'll also show up on our YouTube channel in the Forum so again if you've registered you're gonna get a copy of this webinar automatically you can see speed Fusion connect is uh enabled I got a code I can copy that code right there on my clipboard and then I should be able to go back to the select router go to my ubr Plus Cloud locations I think so let's find out oh pure node there it is right there cool click Start add a pure node paste rename the node uh 20x home oops sorry um add pure node neat and there we go that was kind of cool uh yeah recordings will be available uh what makes the sfc app different than the peplink router utility a lot um I actually it's funny you asked that question um uh Austin I I wanted to do a video or I want to still do a video reviewing all the different really cool management tools that peplink has it is one of the things that I really want to do um and the idea of the sfc app is really designed to manage the sfc cloud services from peplink so your sfc protect your sfc LTE um so purchasing data connecting your Cloud locations um so and then managing these routers almost like a simplified ic2 for end users router utility is basically an app that connects to the router's web GUI um and then brings those features to the to the app so it's not Cloud managed it's device managed so the router utility you have to be Lan connected or when connected to that device the in control 2 app um the ic2 app the peplink also has um brings ic2 base basic functionality right to your to your to your phone so you can have kind of the group level management like you're getting in the sfc but you're getting it on for like your speed Fusion Enterprise you're getting it for um you can manage all your devices and things like that right inside the ic2 app um and so you have the router utility ic2 app sfc app and then you have ic2 in a web browser right the the portal and so the portal is going to give you the most features you're going to have outbound policies firewall policies VLAN capability route router capability Advanced reporting everything's going to be an ic2 the sfc app what we're looking at here is really designed to simplify the setup of a of a of a Soho or Branch device enabling sfc protect and LTE um and then the router utility is designed for to let you log into the router and manage those multiple routers and their statuses but you have to be connected via the land now there's no Cloud broker and then the ic2 is an advanced version of the router utility it's going to give you that same functionality but it's the brokered vehicle via ic2 is that that's a lot of information in a few seconds but does that I hope that answers the question uh so I already answered this uh Keith um can I use the VPN over speed Fusion uh to connect my employee yes and actually it's a very neat way to circumvent uh Hotel Wi-Fi VPN blocking um or even um uh starlink uh people have problems connecting um to their work vpns because of the bursting or TCP acceleration and starlink um you can then Bond it in sfc app protect and then use those vpns um we see people do this in like you know more traditional setups too where they've got a Cisco firewall at a location but like you said maybe they're trying to add starlink to their Wireline connection mix and yet all of a sudden my Cisco VPN doesn't work okay cool well speed Fusion connect will solve that for them they can run their their normal their normal VPN through that and still get that bonding and that failover and all those protection benefits there um and then um do you have an API I don't think sfc app has an API most are I know in control has an API and the routers have an API um but I don't believe the sfc app specifically has an available API look there's my 10 gigs cool loaded up on the 20x so that worked um see um about sfc relay is this just more basic simple way for L2 tunneling to your home router yes and no um so um it's it's not Layer Two um and so that's where um you might be so sfc relay is really designed to create to allow one of one or more uh peer remote peers to use the internet of a host um and so if you think about having like your cable modem at your house um that's maybe on on Cox and Ashes who's local to me so my Cox internet provider and then Cox has like ESPN and and and different TV shows that that are linked to that account I can then open up my I can sfc relay to my 20x and then access those resources as if I was having that Cox IP or I could be in Europe or or Asia or somewhere else and still have that that localized Cox IP um which of these are available in France uh I think all of them but yeah the only thing you can't do in France is choose the carrier right so if you've got our 5G LTE service in the US you can pick Verizon 18t mobile really easily from from that app but you know in France you're not gonna be able to choose orange or whichever other carrier you've got to be able to it's that that data service is still capable there and it's still multi-carrier but you won't have that auto or that ability to control the selection from The Sound then yeah there you go and then Alan asked a really good question why why is the 3T 310 5G fiber not supported the 310 5G fiber is one of my favorite routers um and and and I think it's considered more of a medium and large business a branch router um and so that's going to be more in control um uh managed um so all the features that you see on the sfc app are are capable in the 310 5G but through in control and or the router UI directly I believe that as peplink builds out this app you'll have more and more routers supported um but right now in the beta phase it's it's a select router so just to make sure the technology is working well um yeah if you have a 310 5G you've you've got a good router don't so yeah and if you want it on there go on the form and make that request right yeah request it what's that push that feedback button right we listen to customers like Peter said and so the more people that say Hey I want this model that will definitely bump up the speed in which we actually do that model correct um a really good question from uh Jeremy uh for the LTE 5G Sims um esims does peplink act as a service provider uh I don't know if we act as a service buyer I know I know we're uh I know we're I know we're we partnered I don't know how that how peplink wants to act on that one that sounds like an email question I'm not sure yeah email email that one uh Jeremy we'll reach out to peplink and ask how they want us to answer that question um is it but it is we're pushing uh esems down to the routers um does it work anywhere in the world um David for the most part yes there there are 50 countries right now that are supported by the peplink esems but you can physically install your own Sims as well um and so it they do work most places uh pretty pretty well um so Keith asked a good question he filled out the beta test app tester application but I haven't heard anything on how to get started um the app is actually just in the App Store so if you just go to your um play store or iOS store and then search for sfc app that's it there's there's nothing else you need um the beta tester program is really just about providing feedback um on the app itself so uh to get started just download the app and start using it there's no special codes or anything needed um can you write a link to the Forum post signing up for the Beta app download the sfc app right now see the App Store and the Google David asked a really good question for those who've already thought the application um once again the application is really just about acknowledging that you want to be part of the the beta program so to get started start providing feedback and download the app um the app is already public in the store another David asked he says mine wants to send me to in control two can I avoid this and use the app um I I don't know if you can re re-clarify because I I showed off in the demo how if you're using the app and you're having control you gotta you gotta enable uh you gotta disable configuration for in control um if you have another question related in control too uh please feel free to click the feedback or send us an email I'll be more happy to to guide you through the next process yeah I'm pretty confident that's that's what he's running into is he's already got it registered and in control and yeah Apple's recognize that and warn you say hey you need to go set the setting differently and in control which I it which you could grab the recording and you can see where I showed you how to do that um when I set up my 20x um the ubr LTE does not work yet um so once again the list of supported devices is right here um so you have the ubr plus the transit Duo Pro um the new br1 mini Hardware 3 specifically um the br1 pro 5G the br1 pro LTE Hardware seven um and then the balance 20x um so those are the only devices currently supported um and more if you have a router you want supported I suggest just once again um grab that form post and and asking peplink for um for that here actually I don't know if you well this is the registration from the chat so I've got the the country supported on the 5G LTE data it's the first link and then the second link is that that Forum post so um James asked a really good question about in control and speed future app the answer is yes I kind of showed that in the demo which you would have seen um but you're gonna have a restricted access you're gonna be read only on in control two with basic status reporting but not management um within in control if you migrate to sfc connect but later change your mind can you push a router back yes all you have to do is um reset the router um factory reset the router and then you can load the configuration that's sort of actually one of peplink's recommendations here is download a copy of your config um if you have the router and in control let me uh I don't know if you know this but kind of like a little in control if you hit your show all next to your device name right here you have configuration backups and you can actually download um backups of your configurations and you can actually roll back so I can actually click this router um and I can actually apply this from 827 this morning and roll back and remove the configurations that sfc app has pushed so um but you can download and reload any any configuration you want so if you're using in control you're going to have those the ability to to roll back that configuration if not you can log into the router and just download a copy of your configuration right there um sfc acts as a data plan yes sfc connect 5G LTE is a data plan um that is not uh that has no monthly contract and you're just buying gigabytes so you're gonna buy 10 gigabytes or 100 gigs or terabyte or whatever and just have that available to you um in the in the on the router ic2 does not override well technically if you check that box so uh I got a good question about it can ic2 override so if I want ic2 to override I'd have to click the edit and then right here configuration control and turn back on ic2 once I do this ic2 will override the sfc app and I can take I can kind of force back control uh can sfc LTE be added no and so so sfc protect and sfc LTE are currently not managed in in control they're managed through uh a web site uh sfc.peplink.com and you can purchase and reload those services but to actually configure them you have to either use the router UI or the sfc app so you can purchase you going by going to sfc.pebling.com or reaching out to your partner and I want to reiterate that peplink has a great network of Partners um and the partners can help you provision these Services as well as uh broker purchasing Services as well so um you can go through your partners as well um and coming from a partner you know it's part of the services we provide um but the app in the web portal are available as well uh what is the advantage of using sfc App versus just manage to die directly on the router admin the app is uh a way to have better visibility um so the router the admin page like just like the router utility and or the web admin you have to have physical local access um a lot of people use peplink for branch and remote connectivity all over the world I've got thousands of routers in my in my ic2 right now and so the ability to to access these over the over the Internet or remotely has a great capability power for for Remote Management Additionally the app brings in the configuration and the procurement and the management of the network all in one uh very easy to use app so that's the kind of the benefit of the app over the router UI where the router UI has and we have a video on that actually on the sfc app um and so the the configuring sfc protect and sfc LTE requires multiple steps uh on the router UI directly whereas on the app it's it's very streamlined if that I mean I think that's pretty good I see one comment and then a follow-up question related to that comment of you know people are you know we we use SSC as a just an easier way to say speed feature connect and so some folks have searched in the app store for the sfc app and they're not finding it so just search speed Fusion connect yeah you should be able to find the app then um so uh yeah you don't need a physical SIM for the um the speed Fusion uh the sfc LTE it's it's all esem and it's pushed out um someone asked how I'm able to show this on my desktop I'm using an app called Dex um so this I'm just remote controlling my phone so here's my phone and I'm just remote controlling my phone on so that's uh how I'm doing that um uh sfc does not have InTouch and touch is an ic2 functionality I think you're going to see that coming into our Enterprise features um but if you want to use InTouch I would I would stay on ic2 for right now uh and once again I'm gonna go back to that too I kind of preface this Bob earlier is that um I don't recommend sfc app for Enterprises that are using SFS like regular speed fusion um this is really designed for your ad hoc sfc protect specifically so that dirty internet bonding that peplink provides through its distributed Cloud infrastructure um if you're using speed Fusion I kind of been classifying a speed Fusion Enterprise or speed Fusion for business right if you're using the full version of speed Fusion the sfc app is not the right solution for you the SMC app is really designed for for enabling speed Fusion protect and LTE and then having a simplified management interface um like you said that the RV the home um your your your power user that wants to be able to connect and relay out through his house um and so that's you know really where those features come into play yeah I think that's the whole point of this app is you know speed Fusion is massively powerful technology and it's technology that traditionally only Enterprises were able to deploy and able to afford and you know I say afford because peplink has done it way cheaper than some of the uh more traditional Network vendors but we're trying to make this possible for anybody right like this isn't technology that's only useful for Enterprises this is useful for anybody at home who just wants applications to work better and so that's the whole point of this app is extending that experience out to the general public and in a way that you can actually understand and deploy yourselves instead of needing somebody to come do all this for you and and set it up um and I got a really funny one um from Brad which Brad I think I answered it already but I'm going to restate it because it's really funny um his wife works for a large Hospital who restricts VPN to USA um and they can't connect in Canada so you could connect to sfc protect choose a U.S location um tell it and then on the devices so under connected devices um so you'd go go into the router and then under speed Fusion digital devices choose your wife's laptop right here and select configure Cloud location and auto location hit save now it's going to look like she's coming from the US um so but you need to make sure that on your Cloud locations you go to instead of Auto you want to go to custom and then choose a U.S location so North America Atlanta or Chicago maybe even New York and since you're up in Canada but you could choose um us-based locations and instead of having an auto connect like a Canadian location then just choose the speed Fusion tab here go to digital devices select your wife's laptop tell to you Chicago or New York and now it's going to look like her IP address is in Chicago or New York oh there you go and that yeah Austin gave a good question there so I think that all the questions mostly answered if we didn't answer your question um as always um Travis and I like to be available um we love hosting these meetings um you can reach out to Travis or myself um uh Peter at westnetworks.com or Travis peplink.com um and reach out to us and we'll be more than happy to answer any additional questions about the app and once again this is beta we do recommend uh providing feedback reaching out to peplink on this and um and and helping us build this this tool to be useful uh but I was a little hesitant when it first came out I've seen a couple comments about the the value of it if it's not valuable to you that's fine um there are a lot of people that meet us more simpler uh way to do this and and that's where this this Tool's for um we have like I said we have the in control which is my one of my personal favorites um and then the ic2 app as well and then the router app and then now we have the sfc app and um so I think these tool sets just allow us to just like the peplink routers they they solve a particular problem we have like what nine BR ones right they they solve use cases for for very specific problems um and so this app solves a problem for very specific use case of people and so it's not for everybody um once again power users like myself uh we really love in control but there's a great capability of this app to simplify management and and allow especially if you're an MSP or a reseller like it's a sales tool as well because now the the RV or the work from home person the the uh like Brad his wife that needs to get in there really easy to configure and set up and I think that that's where this tool comes in very powerful absolutely well thanks as always Peter and thank you everyone for joining today and there will be another webinar coming out in another month here so and if you have any suggestions Peter westnetworks.com Travis at peplink.com please if you there's something you want to learn about or see um uh please and if we choose your uh if we choose if you give us a suggestion we choose it we'll send you some swag so um so yeah send any suggestions for the next webinar and uh would be more than happy to uh to to thank you and and uh with a with a shirt or a backpack or something it's so um yeah give us your feedback thank you thank you so much Travis for inviting me and thank you everybody for attending take care folks"}

But what about vessels with nobody on board? Unmanned surface vehicles, known as USVs, are watercrafts that carry no passengers, but still require always-on connectivity\nfor applications such as smart shipping, monitoring, inspection and research. Similar to these are drones, unmanned aerial vehicles \ncontrolled from a separate location. With no crew on board, reliable connectivity\nis needed to host various ongoing traffic while simultaneously keeping systems connected. These can include video, IoT, Sonar or LiDAR systems, and equipment for GPS and vessel controls. To make a reliable network like no other, Use Peplink’s MBX Mini \nin the vessel’s server room. This small yet mighty router \nhas the versatility of any other MBX device and also enables two 5G connections. Add two IP68-rated Maritime 40G antennas to enhance offshore signal reach. Or if you're looking\nfor more cellular connections, deploy two HD1 Dome Pros to the other areas of the vessel for wider coverage. Throw in another WAN connection and secure your network with Starlink,\nby using Wi-Fi WAN or activating the Virtual WAN\nActivation License for your MBX Mini. For unmanned aircrafts such as drones, embed Peplink’s SpeedFusion Engine \nfor dual cellular modems. These two wireless connections\nallow you to utilize Peplink’s bonding or failover capabilities\nfor a reliable connection. Enable SpeedFusion's Hot Failover and\nswitch between available WAN connections. This technology\nseamlessly transfers your traffic to an active connection\nwhen the current line disconnects. For instance,\nwhen LTE signals are out of your vessel’s reach, Hot Failover will connect your network to your Starlink connection\nwithout dropping any of your activities. Incorporate all these Peplink technologies into your \nexisting network infrastructure with ease. Use physical Peplink equipment\nat your data center, or an easily deployable virtual endpoint\nlike Pepink’s FusionHub. Then complete these deployments\nby using InControl, Peplink’s network management system, and remain in control of your vessel\neven with nobody on board. Remotely access or configure your Peplink\ndevices and stay on top of your network. Whether it's for a vessel with hundreds\nof passengers, or none at all,"}

Maitland from Frontier and really this is a this is a brand new kickoff for a brand new series this is our pep talk series and this is a sales focused effort we want to help you folks simplify selling peplink and so this is gonna be the very first of the series again and today we're going to focus on the surveillance market so selling peplink into the surveillance market and again we've got Michael Maitland Mike I I apologize I don't know your title but I know you lead the sales team up Frontier so I'm going to let you introduce yourself and actually tell me your title too well thanks Travis um it's exciting to be on here I've worked with the within the peplink ecosystem for 14 plus years now uh at Frontier us I I hand handle our Channel sales uh team and business um really working along on the public ecosystem with our partners um I had a lot of experience talking with with partners and their customers on applications and and one reason you know we really thought it was important to to bring this webinar to to existence is a lot of focus is always on the technical side peplink does so many great things in their features or products and and in the in the solutions they provide but sometimes it's over people's head how do you get into selling pep link easier how do you make it more efficient or how are you more confident when you're just starting and so really you know that's why we brought this webinar to fruition is how do we give the sales team sales members uh on on the street confidence evidence to go talk about challenges and and solutions within peplink that their customers may be facing and really start and get into that ecosystem make it easy um over time you can then you learn the benefits of the technology the robust portfolio and all the great things we we have to offer additionally but let's get started uh and make it easy to start and build confidence along the way so looking forward to this webinar looking forward to the webinars in the future in regarding in regards to new verticals and applications so people Bri please bring your suggestions on where we should focus um next for for the next webinars and if you'd like to join us let us know that as well we would love to have guests as we proceed uh with with future webinars so thanks great to be here let's get started awesome yeah I think like you highlighted one thing that's really important is just you know yeah peplink's got great technology and we've got all these different products and that is really applicable to so many different applications and use cases and when you're selling to these customers that can be really challenging and intimidating even because you know when you're coming in there you're not the expert in surveillance or medical facilities or all these different locations necessarily but again public is a story that's going to really I think resonate with people in each of those situations we're going to try and boil that down and just give you pieces of information that you can take out in the field and again feel more confident like you said Mike when you're coming into these different situations exactly so with that like I said there's a lot of common challenges out there and I think the things that we'll talk about here probably would apply in a lot of different other markets but again today we're here to talk about surveillance and we're going to just keep peeling this back and go Market to Market in this webinar series but um Mike what what are some of the challenges over the years that you've seen when you come into surveillance networks and customers trying to trying to kind of improve their their connectivity there yeah you know we see a lot of challenges and things we talk with partners and their customers about but kind of boils down into four areas you know to cover most of them and and that that's in regards to environmental what are your power availability what's the temperature what's the ruggedness of the device you need where is that going to be deployed um you know moving into high newer Technologies bandwidth requirements are more and more important every single day a high definition and different things that that are requirements for live streaming and things so you know making sure you have the right bandwidth all the time is is important uh security yeah probably goes along with every market and and vertical but it's always important and and we have you covered there along with scaling and and being able to scale deployments and the management side of things how do you handle these these devices and and the and the routers you have out there to help with this so those are four of the main challenges and we'll kind of dig into those more as we go through uh the different slides here yeah and I think I think those challenges are all things that we've got good stories to tell again you know and it applies in this market but lots of other markets too but the thing that I see a lot is you know people try and just I think I think there's a natural tendency to just try and offer the lowest dollar solution right anytime you come into a new customer a new project it's just like here here's the lowest price device and man I hope this wins right and sometimes you're going to win on that right but that doesn't always hold up when you actually look at all these challenges that you've talked about right and so you know with peplink the blessing and the curse maybe is that we've got a lot of devices to choose from so again we're going to help boil that down for you and help you kind of like give you some guideposts so that you know kind of when to use the br1 mini versus an epx right there's a huge gap in between there but um yeah and we're gonna try and simplify that for you and so um we've broken it down into four tiers and Mike I think this is something that you've really really grabbed on to and helped us expand ourselves and so I'd like you to just kind of walk through these four tiers with us and help you yeah this yeah and this kind of goes down to being able to you know first what Travis just said on the cost of the product right you know you're selling yourself short if you're putting the wrong product into an application you're going to have a lot more work on the back end not the front end if you're sizing these applications wrong and and this goes to to really having a large portfolio and a large uh you know a large solution offering from peplink and and we came up with these four different levels of connectivity really just to be able to help you identify the applications that and and the solutions or challenges that your customers are trying to to solve for and being able to put it into kind of one of four buckets that help you kind of piece together imagine what devices and what Solutions go along with each and every one of those uh kind of buckets and and what we came up with here is is four levels of connectivity um we have first at the bottom Wireless connectivity and we'll dig into each and every one more here as we roll but you know wires connectivity basically just using seller connection connectivity uh as your solution or your back call better connectivity you know this is where you're going into and starting them the multi-wan type of solution whether it's wired connection cellular you may have more devices on the local land side so you want some more ports more accessibility those type of things but um and then as you as you go up it's essential you know this is where bandwidth is really a concern um always on connectivity for high definition or live streaming or live viewing and then Mission critical you know kind of Builds on top of that essential piece you know it's a multi-wan solution with cellular satellites all these different types of inputs but if you don't have connectivity with these critical connectivity options it might be life or limb it might be a liability so you know those are kind of what you want to be digging into with your customers and trying to identify where they fall and then it's easier to identify the the product and the hardware that goes along with that and also adjust it and talk on the on the price point because that's always always a part of it yeah I think if we move from the bottom to the top the the requirements the technical requirements go up and up and up right the the challenge is greater and you know the cost and the budget is going to need to go up and up on that on that scale too and so I think this can help you know kind of on the front end like you said map that customer to what their needs are and what their applications are and I think that'll make it a lot easier to then step through the conversation of what devices right and why that is the right device for them and so they kind of just dive into each of these individually and and help kind of peel that back a little bit so you can understand how to identify these these customers and requirements and so the first one is is just the the wireless connectivity and I think Mike you can probably talk about this more than than I can but um they just want it to be connected and they don't want it to go down they don't want to have to reboot the router and things like that right people try and use these mifi's and these hot spots and you know that's just not a reliable device for 24 7 and so it's just going beyond that I think in most cases but you know more specifically what have you seen folks out there doing in this type of uh requirement yeah really you know what we see here is a lot of vehicle and tripod uh uh type of applications that or or home office this is where you know you have local storage of of the video and the content so that you're not always having to access um um from a live stream or are always on connectivity so you want management to these devices you want accessibility when you need it but you're really not needing to to have always on access to the actual footage right you're not live streaming it's not high def but it's being stored locally so prime example is a police vehicle right A lot of times they have local storage there when they get to the to the headquarters they're offloading that video into the into their uh Network right where they they have more accessibility to it but during that time when they're on the road you can access that you can you can manage it you can make changes you could but it also is touching on the health of that camera making sure it's live there's a heartbeat right but you just don't need that consistent access that uh some of the other levels need yeah I like I like that heartbeat right because it's you know they need to know that the system's working they need to know that it's functioning if there is a problem they need to get those alerts back and so it's it's that sanity check in my mind is you know the wireless connectivity if the vehicle's on the system needs to be on and it needs to work every time but yeah the actual day-to-day usage isn't going to be that heavy in these cases and yeah it could be a vehicle it could be a gate at a front entrance of a facility it could be a lot of different scenarios right it's not necessarily mobile or fixed it I think that reliable just essential Wireless connectivity is common in a lot of different different uh scenarios exactly so as we move up there's better right and well what's better um to me this is just you know making that seamless um you know you go from that it needs to just be always on but you know maybe in this case you've got a coverage Gap right maybe your primary carrier doesn't cover this stretch of highway that you you know you need to make sure you've still got those heartbeats or maybe you are doing a little bit more live viewing or something like that um and again this may not be necessarily mobile it may be fixed locations too but you know Mike what do you see out there in terms of like needing better connectivity than that just basic Wireless yeah a lot a lot of times too is what this is when we start incorporating multiple connections options whether that's a wired way and failing over seamlessly to uh to a seller connection whether it's two sellers like you say if you're on the road and you have dead spots and different things um you know or if you bring in uh you know a satellite option or something more to along that lines but you know also you may have more local devices that you're handling so it may be more of a router or a switch combo type of thing where you're you're having more access controls or or um you know just different devices you need access to right and so that it's it's really like you said I may start having some light you know be wanting to view in the live instance as well um might not need the definition of some of the higher levels of criticality but or connectivity but you know you're just starting to really need that seamlessness and that you know that that accessibility yeah I think that makes sense again it's it's that always on but you know it's it's protecting against that what if if you're your primary connection just isn't there or isn't quite good enough in day-to-day use then yeah you need better right you need better and we can't make bandwidth magically appear and so better often requires that that second connection and so that's really what these devices I think enable so if we step up one more level you know now we're getting into essential and yeah you know essentially this is where things start getting serious right like all of these other applications are of course important but you know in this case that technical requirement I think has jumped up a lot whether that's bandwidth or the reliability aspect again you know there's just a lot more devices here it looks like I think and um you know who do you see doing doing these types of having these types of needs well first these are the type of levels that really now start playing into peplink's capabilities their portfolio the larger devices also they're some of their software capabilities and different things right um this is where you have multiple cameras be empowered by by a device locally you know this is where you need high definition streaming always available from from anywhere you know you know some applications maybe utilities you know where you have a higher value assets um again multiple cameras but also Live Events um big construction sites you know that's where we're seeing these these these type of uh um Solutions being done right and and now we are stepping up into the higher end devices the br2 is a great dual 5G solution right it's ruggedized it's got high temperature ratings and different range and everything but five or two active 5G you can have high definition viewing from this anytime anywhere now you know the one difference is this if you have a blip or something you may be able to live with that right um but you really want it always on that's that's where we're seeing seeing real success here and and some of Pep links Solutions this is where we really outshine the competition um we have a product an offering that fits this right um you know if you have some power requirements or or power is hard to get to you know the the Dome as it is weatherproof but it also has Poe in and out right where you are able to power that camera as well um and then hand off to ethernet so you're kind of your brains or your operations can be a long ways away as well so um this is really where peplink shines but we're able to handle the lower levels as well yeah and I think I think one thing that like you said this is really where our technology and our and our um our portfolio really come together and and tell a much better story than the competition out there you know when you when you've got a dual 5G device you know number one some people recognize the need for that right and there's other people that make dual 5G devices but they don't make them work the same way that pebbling does right and so speed Fusion is that software layer that adds the real value to the customer in this case right so yeah I can take two 5G connections and I can take one camera stream and make that better I can make that faster with anybody else I'm going to take that camera stream and it's going to go out in action 5G connection number one or it's gonna go up 5G connection number two and it's going to live and die on that connection and so we do it better we do it differently and it's not the same as somebody else's dual 5G yes the devices and the technology that really I think tell the story here yeah and this is you know something that I've kind of piggybacked off you from Travis in the past is you know we compete against other other manufacturers or Hardware manufacturers and different things and we create great Hardware but really truly deep down peplink is a software company and we stay we differentiate ourselves with the capabilities the software provides from these high-end or different types of devices the session persistence you know on the bonding the land smoothing different things that that separate us others aren't doing right yeah um and it's really crazy and we'll dig into that more too so yeah it's it's good because you don't have to get super technical right you can just talk about how that impacts what they want to do right you know you can ask them hey you you know you can get a dual 5G device from somebody else but you know what happens when you know your carrier one goes down what what happens to that camera feed right you don't have to talk about all these you know technical details you can say hey this camera might be using this connection and it's going to go down and then yeah maybe it might fail over and come back up two minutes later on that connection but then now all your connections are on that one and so it's easy to talk about it from I think their perspective instead of you know our technology is awesome and these are the details of it right it's it's about what it does for them yeah get get them thinking about the experiences they've had in the past and the pains that that that's come from those right and then you can talk on kind of how peplink sells for that to alleviate so it's yeah it's drawn their experience for sure yeah so we move up to the top of the tier and again we just shine even brighter here because the scalability doesn't end I think you know I think this is similar to the the essential connectivity but it's just more important the it's life and limb at stake or you know millions of dollars right this is just absolute big liability big risk type of situations and yeah we've got solutions to to speak to that but you know who do you see doing these types of these types of requirements or needing having these types of requirements you know a lot of times in this in this area we're looking at you know Public Safety with mobile command Vehicles we're looking at Health Care with mobile uh you know mobile health clinics and different things like that but also from their headquarters side of things where they may have fiber and multiple 5gs for True business critical failover or application failover you know we're seeing it a lot uh you know no energy grids utilities where it's really you need all this access and you need it all the time and if it goes down you don't see that there's a true liability that was created right um and and and like Travis said our Hardware our portfolio our Solutions really play into this and and we we succeed and we shine in these type of applications no one else can really even you know come close to what we're able to do here and it doesn't matter if it's multiple cellular or you have Wi-Fi as Wan or you're using you know you're using satellite connections of any type I mean peplink's so capable of adding and using all those different types of selections to give what you need or give the solution you need all the all access all the time yeah and I think there's some fun stuff here too because you can go outside of really what people even realize is possible I mean we've got a lot of customers doing tele operations of of vehicles right driverless Vehicles where they're driving it from Michigan but at the cars in New York and things like that and that's not science fiction I'm talking about real coupling customers multiple people and customers doing that and they need that video to be absolutely smooth and clean and work every time right it it can't go down and when I go down when you're driving a car right or or like airplane or a helicopter I mean there's some pretty cool stuff out there being done yeah it's all possible and I think the other fun story of you know as we look back down to the other levels is these high-end devices they have the same exact software running inside of them as that 300 some dollar br1 mini right it's the same code same technology all the way up and down the stack and I'm not saying that that br1 mini is the right fit for this application if not but that code base that stability and that technology is all there and it's just about you know sizing the devices to their requirements and their needs and and what their context is but again behind it all it's the same stable reliable powerful technology so it again it just tells a really great story even if there's a lot to pick from and it's kind of overwhelming at first it's uh exactly it's just a matter of sizing it right and you know figuring out what they really need yeah and then that's the and that's and that's the real the key it's sizing it right being confident with your sizing and being confident when you have to offer more than that lower entry level device right yeah I think that's I think that's huge and not getting you know scared into just offering the cheap solution and being able to speak authoritatively to why you know why that won't work well and why this will work better and yeah those are things again we're trying to just dig into deeper here with you folks to give you those tools and ammunition to to go out and tell that story of people um on the technology side though again this is where things really you know differentiate and it's hepling we've got so many devices and so many models and so many different form factors of people always look at our Hardware right and that's kind of impressive because there's just a lot of it there and we make nice reliable devices but you know we're a software company and it's the software that makes peplink different right the hardware lots of people can make a hardware spec sheet that matches our spec sheet cool but it doesn't do the same thing at all and there's a few pieces of our ecosystem that really do things differently and so we've got on the connectivity side you know everybody's got their favorite carrier and we're not trying to change that right you're going to pick T-Mobile ATT Verizon right everybody's got their carrier of choice in in the US or in other countries but um again A lot of times one connection just isn't enough and so we're bringing our own connectivity over the air out of the box so that you can add that second connection really seamlessly you don't have to go out and put another sim card in it we've got our speed Fusion connect 5G LTE service that you can activate and get that second Connection in a kind of on-demand fashion so you're not hassling with contracts and SIM cards and all that stuff so just another way to make that actually a reality for somebody without a whole bunch of Hassle and expense and you know administrative work it makes it easy I mean peplus made it easy to have failover to have a traditionary fail over even to your main failover right and and something that's always available at any time like you mentioned and and from an cost or investment standpoint it's very little right and and from administrative it's almost no right so yeah it makes it really easy and you can you can talk to your customer about always having that last ditch connection yeah you don't have to go get another contract signed up with another carrier and have to go because you know frankly that can be difficult and that can be challenging and then it just kind of muddies the water sometimes and so having that kind of neutral option to activate on demand I think is really really valuable for people exactly you know management is the other piece you know again when you try and roll these things out and people try and just you know go with the lowest cost option that often just Overlook and don't realize until it's already too late that you know oh my gosh it's actually a lot of work to manage even 20 devices out in the field right if they're in 20 different locations or you know imagine you have 200 or 2 000 devices that that becomes a really huge job and really challenging all of a sudden and you don't have really detailed stable reliable and feature full Central management that's gonna be really hard for you to actually maintain a happy customer and going down the road and make sure that that deployment and that investment is is usable and valuable ongoing not just day one right it's the day two day four all the other days after you sell it that that's going to make that customer more happy and you know again come back and grow that instead of have to rethink how they did this and do it differently the next time yeah you know in control is there to help you when you're just starting right and you only have a few devices but you need access you want manage we want Insight you want alerts you want different things right but we have people that are then scaling that as they grow their business maybe they're doing a managed service and they have thousands of devices in here and they're eliminating truck rolls they're you know making themselves uh more efficient and there's so much powerful uh features and tool sets within this that really allow you to take your business and and the way you are handling your customers to the next level um and we see it from all sides so yeah eliminating truck rolls I think that's such a huge thing because customers know how costly and and Troublesome that stuff is right they understand really fast how painful truck rolls are and so that's one thing I've you know been successful with in the past is when we're competing against a cheaper lower cost solution you my challenge to that those customers is always hey try one of those and try one of ours put those out in the real world and see which one you want to live with actually see which one you want 100 of see if you actually can handle having a hundred of that device versus this device right what's that again that what's that day two experience going to be like and that's when you can really start to change minds and really you know win people over of you know oh I'm actually getting a lot more for this investment than you know just saving fifty dollars on the device um I think you know that extends even further now with our in touch service so you can not only man have that similar you know scalable management experience on the peplink device but now you can do that with the cameras behind that peplink device so InTouch lets you remotely access web admin interfaces for cameras phones whatever type of device you want you can do remote desktop SSH FTP or RDP lots of different protocols lots of different things you can do but again you're just making that customer much more scalable much more Nimble and able to manage those devices after they've deployed them yeah in touch goes it shows so much in regards to how peplink's thinking outside the box you know and creating new ways to do things you know people have traditionally done out of band management very differently right and it takes a lot of different devices or access what uh InTouch brings it all into one place right I mean and it's easy to set up I set it up in my home office for for some devices behind my br1 Pro because you know and I was able to do it without any training or anything you know now I can access those devices from anyone and it's just the power of Pep link right there and the capabilities and the ways we're thinking to improve or to make things more efficient and keep on doing it demoing this stuff to customers is you know seeing is believing when you can show them like hey I'm in a web browser over here and I can access that camera over there people go oh wow that's that's really useful I I mean if I had a dollar for every time that that came up on a phone call now I probably wouldn't be a millionaire but it's it's happening almost every phone call we have now when we show people that you know you can talk about it but showing them that capability and how simple that is that really turns the light bulb on for a lot of people definitely so in control I'll go into just a few details here um I think again centralized control is a really big deal you know especially when we talk about the problems we we brought up earlier like security right then control you can centralize all your firewall policies so that your 100 000 devices all have the same exact firewall policies and you've got one place to change that instead of having to go into 100 or a thousand places and change that it's scalable it's seamless and it it just makes that user experience that management experience so much easier and you know really protects you and your customer um the other thing is we can do the management differently than our competition by letting you run it privately sometimes customers are really security sensitive and they don't want to run this in the cloud right they're on a private network with a carrier that doesn't touch the internet on purpose right they're trying to stay away from the internet because they don't want that security risk and so you can run this full featured management experience inside of those private networks without losing any functionality you can still have the that in touch experience too with with the private deployment option we call that our in-control virtual Appliance so and that's that's issue yeah a huge selling point a huge selling point too that people should be aware of maybe not everyone is you know you you mentioned it may be a want right but sometimes it's a must and it's a it's a have to right and and this is something not many others can can provide or or or or have a solution for so make sure if you're not aware of icva and you know this this piece let's learn more from uh um from from from the people you speak with uh about peplink because it can go a long ways for certain applications yeah if you've got a government customer you can run in control privately in AWS gov Cloud right in a certified data center that meets that customer's Baseline security requirements that's not possible with almost I don't know of any other manufacturers that can do that right exactly that's just an absolute differentiator and whether like you said whether or not they actually utilize that I think it shows that we're paying attention and we actually listen and you know are focusing on what these challenges are with customers and instead of taking these options away and pushing you into the cloud exactly and again within touch it's just it's just easy right you can just log into whatever the heck's behind that pep link don't have to think about where it is what you know I don't have to set up any vpns I don't have to do anything except for Point click and it's in my web browser right much much easier and it's it's a huge problem for people they're building like you said they're building out a band management networks they're adding software packages they're running PCS inside of the vehicles to do these things they're doing all kinds of stuff and not only do we enable this capability it's just included if you have a care plan this is included you don't have to buy this extra you don't they don't nobody has to think about it it's just there and you know it's something most vendors don't have and others are taking it away and depreciating this functionality even again they're not paying attention to the needs of their customers and half-link absolutely is so the last technology piece we'll talk about again is our speed Fusion connect 5G LTE service so this is a an esim based service and so it's over the air it kind of feels like magic when you actually deploy this you can plug a router into the wall and screw some antennas on and go push some buttons on a website and boom your device comes online that's pretty cool um but again not everybody's gonna need that or want that you know everybody's kind of got their favorite carrier and you're going to have a good deal often on data with that carrier right nobody's going to be able to beat the price of buying data from a carrier reseller or a carrier directly and so that's not what we're trying to do here again we're trying to add that convenience factor so whether it's something you use strategically as you know your backup connection or maybe more just day to day like oh my gosh this unit's offline and I need to troubleshoot it okay I'm going to activate that's that esim and see if that see if it's my my SIM card that's not working right you've got different ways that you can use this but again it's there and it's available and you can use it whenever you want and you don't have to use it either but yeah exactly a unique offering that again nobody else is really providing yeah and your point is it's just accessible with a couple couple pushes of a button right it's really easy and and you've just created more redundancy across your connections with this as a last layer and it works well it's like you say it's pretty much like magic but it takes the pain takes the headache away um and it makes you feel better and safer when having it as an option even if it's not yeah um enabled to start you can always enable it so now if you're monitoring a pipeline that's a thousand miles away and that unit goes offline well you can see if it's just a SIM card right you can activate that esim and you don't have to send anybody out there or do anything did it come back online yes okay then that was my issue didn't it well maybe there is a power issue and maybe I do need to send somebody out there but now you've got more tools that you can use without getting out of bed frankly you can just look at it on the website and see what else see what else might be going on yeah exactly so I think that covers most of the content for today but the content on the webinar content doesn't end on the webinar our team again we listen to you folks we know that we've got um gaps to fill in our training and we're working like crazy to do that and so we're creating vertical industry specific content to help you guys speak to these customers speak to their needs and really speak to the things that they want to understand um Mike I know this is something you folks have asked for forever from your sales team it was just we need more tools and more resources out there yeah make it more accessible to to the network right into the channel and peplink's done a heck of a good job and in creating these materials a lot comes from feedback from the partners from their customers so please provide it whether it's in the Forum or or to your distributor directly they can feed that into peplink but they're working hard to to create the the materials to enable you and your sales team to go out be more confident understand what problems we're solving what devices are going to be used and how to sell that right and that's the key we we need to to arm you with that confidence and those capabilities and those those that information to be able to do that and they're adding a lot of great content on other verticals um and again please please share your ideas if something's missing if you need something that that's how peplink kind of creates new products but also new materials and new you know new new marketing pieces is it's it's by what the partners in the channel need so please share your thoughts yeah and again if you know maybe you've been in some of these resources before but we're updating this really rapidly so just in the last couple of days and weeks we have put a whole bunch of new content in here so again if you've looked at it before and dived back in there and keep looking and yeah give us that feedback because we're still making more we're not done exactly we'll keep making more yeah and we're not done with the webinar series either again this is the first one and we're going to dive into a bunch more verticals a bunch more use cases and so you know speak up tell us what you want to hear about and if you want to speak tell your story speak up as well and you know worst case submit a case study right we would love to feature different different customers case studies applications and and go you know dive into those deep as well and so yeah feel free to reach out to marketing at peplink and share your thoughts there um that really covers all the content we had for today but um there's questions out there and so we're going to stay on here past time and we'll take some of the questions live and so feel free to put those in the Q a chat and yeah Travis we got a few questions so far so um um first one where can I learn more about icva oh that's a good question I'm gonna go look on my web browser and get a link for that because it's definitely on our website and and I will get a link ready for everybody yeah and and and you know there's there's good materials and good information travels will fill that in but you know also work with your Distributors guys and they can fill you in on on these platforms and these Technologies these services and and help you along the lines and if something they can't ask we'll get right to peplink for it so um just just reach out and and and ask icba is a true differentiator that not always needed but when it is it will help you win the job so we'll add that link in here um another question what's the difference between in control and in touch that's a good question so in touch is an add-on feature to in control so in control is the browser-based management system that you can manage all your pep links and you can remotely log into your pep links and then in touch is a feature inside of in control so it lets you go from that peplink device to whatever is plugged in behind that pebbling so it's just another tool in that web browser so you don't need a VPN client on your laptop you don't need a VPN connection to these devices you just you just find your client on The Client List and in control and you click the InTouch button and you tell it oh is this HTTP is this https right you is this remote desktop you just choose from the drop down it's going to automatically fill in the IP address in that device and you just put in the few parameters you need to actually connect to it and press connect and then that shows up in your web browser so if it's remote desktop it's in a brow it's in a browser tab you're not using third-party software or anything it's just right there in the browser yeah a couple of good questions coming up so is adding more devices with Poe capabilities on the roadmap so great for security and surveillance yeah the roadmap is always influenced by customers so um you know speaking of here is great but yeah send sales at peplink.com marketing at peplink.com let us know what you know what the requirements are what you know is it 802 3at is it 8023 AF how many ports you need what what type of connectivity you need just give us some details on you know what the use case is what the scenario is and you know the more people that asked for that the more likely we are to do that and so um whether it's you know emailing us or putting it on the Forum the forum's often very helpful because you can get that kind of Groundswell um response from other people in the community too and you know that for me that's just a great segue to talk about you know forum.peppelin.com we have just an awesome powerful Community there are so many just super smart people out there sharing just really detailed information about how they're succeeding in these different use cases and so again there's lots of friends out there that probably want the same thing and yeah speak up there I think is one of the best places but I'll add one thing I think this is top of mind so bring bring your thoughts bring your your ideas but uh yes it's something that uh that is that's been talked about so uh last one that we have so far but please feel free to add more our pep links compatible with the Palo Alto agentless Global Pro Tech VPN I'm not sure I'm not familiar with that I mean I'm very familiar with Palo Alto and use them over the years they're they're a great security device and Company but yeah I'm not familiar specifically with what the requirements or um if it's a if it's a clientless VPN I'm not sure what the what the requirement from the peplink side would be but um I think that's a good one to either put in the Forum or email into marketing at peplink and ask you know if you can give us a little bit more details on that then I think we can dig into that more specifically yeah and you know we find we're compatible with a lot of VPN solutions from other manufacturers but it does need to be looked at Case by case individually so uh bring it to us and we'll help dig into that and see how we make it work you see vpns go across the speed Fusion VPN in applications you know and and from ipsec standpoint you you can connect some so just let us know um and we'll we'll dig in more on that so I see a question on ip55 device um that that is an older device and so it doesn't have a direct replacement at the moment that I'm aware of that I think the Dome devices are the most easy um device to speak about there because it's just a similar form factor in terms of outdoor and it also provides a similar capability in terms of Poe input and then Poe outputs there's a port splitter there that you can have that Poe in and Poe out hang a camera off of that device so I think that's the most direct replacement but there isn't like a new hardware revision specifically of that ip55 yet that I'm aware of um yeah those HD1 domes HD2 domes I think are the the easiest place to look for a similar product there yeah um I think the other piece that we hear a lot about on the on the security side is just you know people are really concerned about where devices are manufactured you know uh there's a few different pieces of U.S legislation ndaa TIAA compliance um those are things that peplink is all compliant with and so you know when the security question comes up that's often a question is where is this device manufactured Taiwan is always the answer for us and you know if they need official certification that that we are in compliance with those requirements that's something we're absolutely happy to provide a signed company certification that yes we are actually compliant with those security requirements so those are those are easy conversations we've not had any problems with those conversations we've not hit any barriers that we were not able to overcome and actually sell to that customer with and I don't think I don't think your experience has been different like on that one no I mean we sell into a lot of space that that would be a concern and that's looked at heavily right and it's never been said that uh or at least in my experience from I'm working with the customer or through our partners or or or feedback from the partner that that's been a stop Gap right that they couldn't move forward with peplink because of this issue right it is on the you know it's obviously a top of Mind subject especially with everything going on um but it's nothing that's ever held us back from from winning a deal or getting getting the product in the into the agencies or clients wherever it may go so yeah again I think oftentimes it really comes back to you know our security architecture is just much better than a lot of other people right you can take any piece of our solution and completely privatize it put that in a zero internet access environment and I don't know any other vendors that can really say that and still maintain that Central management and all those features right so you know absolutely those requirements are important and those those checks need to be checked but um you know when you come to the day-to-day realities of what security really is running everything in the cloud is a big problem for people and so having those options and those tools to really lock things down often is the eye opener for customers that oh this is a more secure solution other questions um Mike this is great thanks so much and um thank you everybody for joining yeah thank you everyone thank you Travis look forward to continuing this series as we move forward everyone remember please uh give your suggestions and and and if you'd like to be a part of it let us know talk to you soon all right bye folks"}

cuplink and as usual this is our peplink University series and we are joined again today by Professor P who is Peter West Peter what do we got to talk about today today we're going to talk about one of my favorite Innovations of the the peplink ecosystem is the simix Sim injector um and the idea of making SIM cards accessible and various deployments and so uh I've got my my lab set up I've got my my br2 Pro 5G with a Sim injector mini I've got an HD one Dome with the SIM injector 56 volt and I've got an epx with three domes and the Sim injector Flex module so we're gonna show showcase these Technologies and help us understand why we would use them I think it's fair to say you've probably deployed more Sim injectors than anybody out there in the in the peplink ecosystem I'm I'm taking a guess at that but I know you use it heavily so I'm excited to see the different ways you get you put this together me too I'm excited to share it um so I I think we should just Dive Right into what is the Sim injector and and I actually add another slide uh kind of comparing the Sim injector to the Sim extender because that's actually a very different product and so um the the so the Sim injector it uh comes in three flavors well let's talk about what the subjector is right so the Sim injector is the the digitalization of a physical SIM card it is not converting a SIM card to an esem officially um right so so it's it's the digitalization or the transport of your your sim card certificate uh over IP is it's probably the the most politically correct way to say that right yeah we're just decoupling the radio and the SIM card so that you can spread those out and make it more convenient so it does require a compatible pevlink router that has the the the the rsem component built into the module that allows you to to do this so what it's doing is it's taking this physical SIM card converting it into an electrical signal over the ethernet over IP I should say and then actually putting that into uh the the module of a of a uh of a modem of a peplink modem and so and then that's very simplistic there's a lot of really cool technology goes into this but I feel like it'd be on I I'm not going to do it justice to try to explain the circuitry portion of it um and so yeah what can you do with it and how does it help you the idea is really neat making it so that we can put in SIM cards anywhere in the world and have them show up on a router somewhere else in the world and what does that means having a SIM card have you know having a Sim uh Sim injector on my desk and having an HD one Dome on the roof of my building or having a Sim injector in a compartment in a and a yacht and having an HD1 Dome or multiple HD1 domes on you know 70 feet up in the air on the top of a mast or in a really large uh Warehouse building where you maybe have you know two or three hundred feet of space between the data center the IDF and your in your domes on the roof being able to just have a SIM injector push those SIM cards out to uh up to the roof or in like a a cruise ship I mean where you have thousands of feet having HD1 domes at either end of the ship and pushing these SIM cards out to the the remote domes and so the idea or even better having your data center and having hundreds of peplink routers out in the field and pushing SIM cards to that that's coming soon um it's available but not today our doctor we're going to talk about today um and so the idea is to review these different methods and why we have three well four five technically different products to do this and so we're gonna talk about the three Sim injector uh main primary devices and then we're going to talk about the Sim extender um and then uh we'll have a little bit of fun with some some scenarios so the Sim injector is the first product that they made um it's basically a four port Poe plus switch with eight SIM cards in it it supports 12 to 56 volt DC so you can plug it right into a DC electrical system or you can plug in a 56 volt uh AC to DC power adapter uh through the little of the round plug uh it what's nice about this and the scenario of my lab is I have a SIM injector and then I'm powering a switch an AP and a dome kind of simulating if you had a dome on on a boat you have the Sim injector and then you have an AP or more than one AP powering that and so very easy and robust you don't have to buy an extra Poe plus switch um it's kind of all-in-one designed for small networks a very powerful and capable unit um then you have the Sim injector Mini the Sim injector mini is designed um as a lower cost alternative to people that already have an infrastructure so if I already have a Poe switch and I don't need Poe or I want to put this in a different location than my Poe environment for easier access or more robustness um or like in My Demo I have a br2 pro 5G with 12 volt system and a battery I don't want 56 volt and nor do I need it and so the the Sim injector mini is a non-poe output but it does support Poe plus input for power to the device smaller form factor and then allows you to push up to eight SIM cards up to your environment then you have the Sim injector Flex module this thing is a beast 56 nano SIM cards in an sdx sdx Pro or epx and the idea is there's two currently available two main purposes for this one scenario that I'm going to demo today where I have the flex module and then I've got domes and you can have three domes or 16 domes or 40 domes connected to the system uh using VLAN as Lan capabilities now built into uh our puffling environment so I've got two domes VLAN is wan one dome in Synergy mode and then a flex module so I'm going to Showcase that but the idea here is one for for for enhanced scalability of your infrastructure for larger deployments two remote cement management so in other words an epx or an sdx or a balanced router can act as a proxy server and it can actually receive remote requests um via the WAN interface to a a router and so there's some technology that peplink's building out that actually allow us to remotely manage or remotely push SIM cards out um in the the the flex module is really the the core base of that starting technology and it's an absolutely amazing you can play with and you can literally it's the units on I can pull this out as a ribbon cable I can see my flashing lights on it I it is it is really cool I'll move the camera over there a little bit more when I move over there for the demo um and so those are the the three main types of flex mod uh Sim injector um oh go ahead yeah I just I think you know for folks that are aren't quite following here I think there's maybe a a question of why do I need all these SIM cards right like what what am I doing with 56 SIM cards and I I think you're gonna dive into that more but you know sometimes you're roaming and you've got a lot of different carriers you need to connect to and sometimes you're burning through data plans and you need to burn through SIM cards and a and b Sim just is not enough in a lot of users cases and that might not be the majority of people out there but there's a lot of people trying to do things with 5G and these technologies that really just need a lot more SIM cards to do what they're trying to do and this makes it so much easier yeah there's really two main reasons for carrier for for multiple SIM card diversity right well three primary reasons one multiple multiple modems need multiple SIM cards so one-to-one deployment two like uh like Travis said data plans right if I have a 100 Gig data plan and I want to run three terabytes of data a month I need 30 SIM cards technical um and so uh data plan management uh you know we call those like maybe data pools or some variant they're out but the idea is being able to fail over to to additional SIM cards once I've reached my my limits of a SIM card um that was more important back before the carriers released the business plans the business unlimited plans um now we can actually get lots of gigabytes for a very affordable price um but back you know what like what three years ago or even two years ago Verizon would hard throttle to it 15 or 22 Megs or gigs and it's like boom you're done and it's like 128 kilobits of throughput and so we needed a lot of SIM cards to to push two or three hundred gigs of data if we wanted to keep that dollar per gigabyte low um yeah I think throttling is a really big one too because it's not down right like a lot of routers can't really deal with this because it didn't go down it still is it's not failed so it's not going to fail over yeah yeah um and then the third one is Carrier diversity whether that's going from an ATT strong area to a T-Mobile area or a Verizon area or going from America to South America to Asia to Europe the ability to roam carriers as you as you Traverse different zones um uh is really important for a lot of customers and so the Sim injector provides the ability to easily extend the number of SIM cards into your environment um and and there's a couple ways to do that but but it's really like those are the three core reasons why you would want to have it and they're and I've seen some really cool scenarios where there's additional reasons like the Sim ejector just simple location right but that's not really a reason for multiple SIM cards as much as just Simplicity of deployment um yeah and location is a great one because yeah you know if you roll out a thousand stores and you've got a dome on top and you change carriers well that's a thousand truck rolls yeah SIM card or you just pull out a super station and put a thousand SIM cards in it you're done so you got to get a union guy on a ladder and I mean it turns into a nightmare really fast so just change that itty bitty little smaller than a postage stamp SIM card and yeah exactly um and so uh the Sim injector uh uh and uh Sim injector mini supports uh a various number of peplink routers um and so you're gonna get the uh the 20x with uh contingency here which I'll follow up on a second um the the 310 5G the 310 fiber 5G 310x 310x5g the 380x with the module the 580x with the flex mini module because those don't come with cellular built in the sdx Pro with a flex module um and in the epx with the flex module it is important to note that the the sdx pro and epx and there's a little note here but the um there are some of the three ltes that don't support uh rsem technology and you want to go to the four uh the four LTE um and then the 5G ones do work but there are a couple older three LTE models that don't support the rsim technology uh so just important to know now once again kind of not as big of a deal unless you're doing remote deployments because the Sim injector or the SIM cards are nice and on the epx in your data center and you just swap the SIM cards um but it is important to know that the flex module there are some Flex modules that don't support rsem that are the older Cat6 and stuff like that um because we had we had a little issue with that with one of our one of our customers um the the Sim injector uh which has eight SIM cards they're mini Sims so they're two FF it's the larger of the three sizes so if I if I grab a uh it's it's the larger the larger of the three sizes the the Sim injector Mini uses the nano SIM cards I don't know if you guys can see that or not but the tiny tiny ones and then the larger of the three so two FF and four FF um The Sim injector is 10 100 1000 gigabit with Poe uh plus output and the idea here is connecting into your ex using it as a switch so the idea is you can plug your APS and things like this into it or um other devices the Sim injector mini is just a 10 100 Port uh with Poe input so once again be able to just plug this into your infrastructure and extend your sim cards it's really great for SIM card like anywhere you can plug this into any wall outlet or any connection and then extend you know make you know put this in the Captain's Quarters on a boat for example and push those SIM cards out um so really nice the uh the Sim injector is a little bit bigger than the semi this uh Sim injector mini um The Sim injector is uh higher priced um it's 9.99 us with a bundle and that's important to note because I believe it's more expensive um if you buy it by itself uh and then the Sim injector Mini is uh you know about half the price um and really so really scalable and uh and then the the injector is really applicable to like Dome products where you're you're putting it in for your powering that Upstream device um and then the Sim injector mini is really applicable to every non-poe uh device or POI output devices so for example like powering on an sdx or like in my scenario br2 Pro 5G or a br you know uh you know another product that might support um The Sim injector technology so the idea is just being able to deploy those Simplicity uh I'm loving my my mini in my briefcase and I'll demo demonstrate that a little bit but it's it's a really cool use case that solves a lot of problems yeah I think the the poe input on the mini is really neat too because that just yeah you know like you can with location it makes it so much easier right you could well you don't have to have a feeling you have to have 12 volt power yeah you just you plug it in the captain you know you can put it right on the Captain's Quarters you know so he can swap SIM cards or she can swap SIM cards and then you don't have to plug it in literally just leave the leave the front cover off of it and just let them know hey you plug in the set you can literally plug in whatever SIM card you want in any country you want and it makes it very user friendly because they just they could manually swap Sims without any programming um and be done up and right now you can program it to also fail over but um first for Simplicity you could also just manually swap the sentence which is what's nice about the mini um let's not confuse the Sim injector versus The Sim extender the Sim extender is a literal ribbon cable that extends the connectors on the the some slot to a uh an additional external component the idea here is um a lot of times these are used like in the PDX you know if you have the if you ever use the PDX you'll have the Sim extenders so the idea is to basically take the SIM card that's on the back side of a router maybe build a little a surface mount and then move to the front actually we want this is something that one of our customers makes so it's it's a little one you are like one Ru Mount that has the sem extenders connected and you just plug this into an mbx that's underneath it and now you have the mbx with the SIM cards on the front and so the idea here is just some um physically moving the SIM card from the back from one location on the router to wherever you want uh and so the Sim extender is not an IP based solution and it's only compatible with the 2ff um the larger uh slots at this point so yeah this is just a shorter range version of kind of what we were talking about just changing the application device right I've seen it for cases and racks like you said and super handy for those those examples but yeah you got a much shorter distance um so here's just a side by side of all three which we've already talked about um but just for the for the purpose of the video it's a nice little visual comparison of the three Technologies and it's no different than physically putting them in the slot so I've been moving it exactly and so you know here's like kind of like deployment scenarios which is very similar to actually what I have demonstrated so it's kind of nice but you have like the Sim injector with an access point in a dome it's a perfect scenario here you have a built you have a full Network being completed by this one product and so it unifies that that environment uh the Sim injector mini extending the Sim Slots of an mbx or a VR2 Pro 5G once again allows you to just change the location of the Sim slots or make it easier to access um and then the flex module plugging it into like an epx or sdx Pro um allowing you to manage additional uh either remote devices and or further away devices or just add some to your existing um modules if you just need for additional sim cards for for an increased resiliency like we talked about with database plan uh gigabyte planning so you know each module has you know each each modem only supports two SIM cards so if you needed eight SIM cards or or five sim cards for a modem you could load them up and then use gigabyte planning uh tools or use Regional swapping to uh fail have increa more sim cards for that diversity um a really cool deployment we did up in uh Texas actually and so we had a whole bunch of Domes mounted uh externally plugged the Sim injectors into the sdx the sdx was plugged it had the domes uh upstream and so we were able to push if you notice there's only four domes in this project 16 SIM cards so once again lots of gigabytes and that was the whole purpose of this so so Dome one uses slots one through four Dome two uses slots uh five through eight Dome three is one through four and zone four is uh five through eight and so the idea is they can have lots and lots of gigabytes um which is the even further extension of the the capabilities um remote uh there is a user manual for this um how to reset just hold the power button for five to ten seconds and it's gonna reset um what are the requirements for the remote sem um cellular router that supports the rsim technology um and if you upgrade to 8.21 or 83 you might see a notification on the bottom yeah this your your device doesn't support our sound that is not your device is broken it's simply letting you know that the modem in your device isn't arsim capable because people were buying the Sim injector thinking they could extend it and so we needed to put a note on the router to identify that hey this this mode of this device doesn't support RSM and make it very aware uh you know aware um the the Sim injector itself um and then a SIM card to plug into the sub injector okay so now I'm going to demo this so let me let me go into my lab so the first thing I have is uh my vizios which I love Vizio if you've ever heard me give a talk especially at peplink University talk uh or training um I build vizios for every scenario for every customer because I want to make sure that if somebody has a question or is describing a scenario that my visualization or interpretation of that is the same as your visualization or interpretation of that um of my words and so um the first demo is the epx Sim lab and so in this scenario I have two HD1 domes connected to a 48 Port switch that that has VLAN tagging VLAN 1101 and 1102 and I'm using the new VLAN as Lan feature on the epx to add these as enter as lands then I'm using the rsem remote sem uh proxy of the of the epx to share the Sim Bank over the WAN of the epx allowing these domes to talk to this Sim injector over the over the WAN interface and then in Synergy mode well it's different because it brings it internally and so you're just pointing it at the Sim injector um so it's kind of a weird uh difference there but um with Synergy mode on what I'm doing is demonstrating that it's the built-in cellular modem using Synergy mode and I'm pushing uh Sim slot 3 to that synergized device this once again we're using VLAN as Wan it's a pretty neat project product and so my VLAN is wan I have the WAN interface that is my sfp13 going up into my my switch and then for the Lan my my Poe uh my AP is plugged into the same switch and so it uses the red cable here this uh uh this ethernet uh sfp12 or Port 51 on the 48 Port switch to actually trunk Lan traffic so I'm jumping Wan and land over the the same switch I'm using two cables because I play around you could technically do this all uh on the lamp but it's for me uh some additional testing that I'm doing uh in my lab I have to set this up dedicated land and a dedicated lamp uh then I'm gonna demonstrate the at the HD one Dome and so let me zoom in on this because that was probably really small I apologize um and so the HD1 Dome scenario here is is demonstrated on my lab and the idea here is we have an HD1 Dome connected to a Sim injector with an AP connected to that Sim injector and then I'm pushing slot one up to the Dome um very like why this was invented um and then and then as I always do I end up screwing it up for peplink and I do something like this where I said hey I can push this out and this is a standard deployment of mine um it's one of my favorite types of deployments I take the sdx pro um with two eight Port Flex modules uh and then I can plug anywhere from two to six well to about 10 you get to a Poe budget limit um but two to twelve uh domes uh connected here and then plugging in a Sim injector and then pushing the stems up to those remote domes and once again this uses using something called the remote sem proxy which I will demonstrate uh when I show the uh the 8bit epx setup but this is a very standard deployment of mine and then I we build a little briefcases um so we put pep links in briefcases with a 12 volt battery but constant complaint I can't access stem slots the Sim slots are on the back I've got all the ethernet K all the antenna cables back there they're pushed back against the back no one can see the SIM cards common complaint so we took a Sim injector mini and I put it in my briefcase facing forward so the Sim slot is backwards against the back wall of the briefcase but the Sim injector mini extends that out and I'm powering it with the 12 volt the same 12 volt battery the powers my br2 Pro 5G so now I have a hot spot that supports eight sim cards for ATT T-Mobile Verizon uh continuity that is all connected via 12 volt and a battery with high gain at 10 and a little briefcase design and so I'm going to demonstrate that and once again the idea behind Professor p and the reason I'm going through it so fast is I wanted to make sure I give time to show you how I can figure this now normally we will set this up live um however it actually takes a while for SIM cards to activate whether with or without a SIM injector and so I thought instead of having like a two minute pause uh I would have everything pre-programmed and show you the settings so this is gonna be a little bit different demo where I'm basically going to show you what I did rather than doing it live mostly to save you guys from the the waiting while I spin things up and program them on my laptop so let's go to peplink university in control is that okay size or should I do something like that is that better good okay so let me uh zoom in on that I mean that one's already zoomed in okay so um the first one we talked about is my epx design so this is uh right here and and so what I what I have can you hear me okay if I talk louder so far okay so what I have is the epx the fiber cables these are 10 gig fiber going up into my switch and then I have the Sim injector Flex module right here and so I've got three SIM cards installed in it right here then I have two uh cables going from the 48 Port switch to these two domes here and then this dome right here is being powered by Synergy mode right here so here's my device you can see here's my ethernet one seven HD1 Synergy here's my VLAN 1101 HD1 uh uh don't that I just that's just the last two octets of the IP just from my memory and then here's the my VLAN 1102 HD1 Dome and then my switch and my epx and my AP1 Enterprise so if I log into my switch what I've done is I've created I've I've set ports one through seven oh sorry one and two I forgot I factory reset this for the for the demo um so I have one and two are set as success vwan 1101 so if I click on this and go to edit I said to an access port VLAN 1101 that way when I plug the Dome into that it's being tagged 1101 as it enters the switch then on Port 49 this trunks down to the epx and so I trunk 1101 to 1107 so I have seven of these that I could trunk if I wanted to actually I've got these 120 ones but that's for a different project um and so I have 1101 to 1107 that then get trumped down on Port 49 which goes into my ethernet what my my uh SFP 1-3 so I have a dedicated 10 gig fiberlink just for my my V my VLAN is when then I have my port 51 which I trunk VLAN 1 and VLAN 188 my management and so you can see there is my devices so I've got a Poe camera running on 192.1685 on VLAN one I've got my uh whatever dot 12 is probably that my speech connect relay device and then or my AP no that yeah that'd be my AP so my AP is 1.12 and then I've got my switch which is uh being managed on the 188 Network and so it's trunking down on VLAN 188 um whereas the actual switches interface is on the network management hopefully that wasn't too confusing I'm trying to keep it relatively simple but I want to show you what I did I want to show how um and this will be published on YouTube so you can always watch it later and and check those settings so then on the epx we want to program everything so I'm gonna go to my epx and go to settings remote web admin see the waiting this is why I didn't want to do uh all of it waiting okay so you can see here I've got three internet connections you can see that I'm synergizing one of my domes you can see ethernet one seven which is this one right here is in Synergy mode and instead of showing up as a dome it shows up as cellular one one then my two domes show up as just regular ethernet uh winds these are uh ethernet wins and then I've got my sim injector and you can see Max Capacity 56 Sims um and then you can see my my fiber modules so on the the Synergy mode I go to network and I've already we do have a Synergy mode video but just for the purposes of of going through the steps I go to WAN and if I scroll all the way down under wind Synergy controller I turn it on and I can I have Synergy enabled for ethernet one seven and one eight so ethernet one seven and one eight are my Synergy uh capable uh Port so if I plugged another Dome into ethernet one eight or a Transit duo or something else those ethernet ports would show up once you plug in a factory reset 8.3 Dome into ethernet one seven itch comes up as a cellular device and then you'll see it says priority for ethernet one seven connected to and there's my my Dome so I can click on cellular one one and I can manage this as if it was a modem and you'll see down here I've got sim a some B and then remote sem and I simply put in the serial number of the flex module which is um on the box when you buy it or underneath it um not super convenient in a flex module so make sure you document that when you plug it in but I you plug you program the serial number of the flex module and then the port that you want it to use so I have and you don't have to use a port number but when you're doing multiple SIM cards it's nice to know that they're not going to try to to hit the same one I I find this this is actually sort of like something of trial and error where you have you know if you have a whole bunch of SIM cards in the domes are just randomly picking a SIM card which it will do um it's not clean because like Sims you know Dome a is looking at Sim 5 and then Dome a is looking at Sim 3 the next time you reboot so it just for me I know that Sim 3 or slot 3 is going to dome three it it's very clean and nice and then right here under the priorities I can prioritize so I can say here's my two integrated slots on the Dome and then here's my uh my remote Sim so I want remote Priority One and then the remote the physical Sims to be priority two and there is there is a reason for that um that's going to be coming later with some some even enhanced technology and then I hit save and apply and then this Dome reads the Sim injector because it's on the lamp so it reads the Sim injector starts working everything's great on the win side VLAN is wan we need to enable remote sem proxy so if I go into my router uh the URL up top there's the index.cgi if I change this to support.cgi I have the ability to turn on remote Sim proxy right here I can hit click to configure and I turn it on remote Sim proxy allows the WAN of the router to to proxy the the Sim injector once I turn on the remote Sim proxy and enable that I can now log into my VLAN as when domes together oops okay and there's two things that we have to do on a dome that's being proxied via the the WAN of the of a of an upstream or Downstream router first we want to go to the advanced tab and enable remote Sim management so you don't have to add all these extra settings this is for for pools and really cool there's some cool advanced stuff you can do here but just to make it work you just click the the edit button turn on auto land Discovery hit save that's it there are other things there's more advanced things that you can do but to for the purpose of this lab it doesn't have to be overly complicated um you can add automatic settings here and the reason why you would do this is you can add the serial number and then you can add the uh you can customize the APN so for example say you have a Verizon sim with a static APN and you need that Verizon sim to come up as s01.vzw static well I can add the serial number of my sun injector put in the port name slot two custom so01.vzw static and now when it tools that Sim slot it's going to apply the APN so if you have static AP static IP addresses on like T-Mobile or ATT or Verizon or you're using a custom APN SIM card you want to use this add add remote Sim feature to customize the AP and that way when the router pulls that in it knows what APM to use so you hit save and apply changes then you go to the dashboard click on cellular go to remote Sim and put in your sim your serial number colon the port so this one is going to use port one the other one is using four two and then the Sim injector the the Synergy mode One is using Port three so now I have all three SIM cards being pushed up to The Domes via um my epx and so kind of complicated but that took like all of nine minutes to explain with the Vizio so not that bad the the issue is patience it takes a few seconds don't don't press apply changes and then think it's not working because it says no SIM card give it a few seconds to query the the the Sim injector you'll see it start flashing um I wish I could move my camera closer but you'll see it left I might be able to see if I can this one's battery powered so I don't know if you can see this on the camera or not so I'm gonna try it can you see it flashing uh right there so so the SIM card when the SIM card is being read by the domes or by whatever um it's gonna start flashing that's how you know it's working um so it'll if it's not flashing so the Upstream device is not looking at it um and so that's that's important to note sorry I hope that wasn't too awkward moving the camera like that but um okay and then just to make to make it all nice and pretty I went to speed Fusion connect protect enabled client mode turn on bonding went to my advanced went to outbound policies set an enforced pool rule that uses speed Fusion uh connect and then if I look at my speed Fusion VPN status I can see there's my two VLAN as wands and there's my one cellular being being actively used um and so I'm bonding all this stuff via the epx was that too complicated uh Travis I mean did that kind of answer the okay good this is technology that nobody else has so you know it took you nine minutes to explain it and yeah you can't do this elsewhere so yeah I think I think that makes sense is just a little detail the VLAN is when engineering is working on making that compatible with Synergy mode too so that you would actually get that same experience there so that's why this is factory reset because I was running the special firmware that had Synergy mode for vlanoswan so it is coming um I just didn't want to dim it it's not it's not GA yet so I didn't want to demo it but yes uh it works great so VLAN is wan Synergy mode basically would make this cellular one one cellular one two or sell your two one and sell your three one and you'd actually have three cellulars built right in and then the remote proxy settings and things like that go away um and so it's really cool technology uh so I would assume you'll see that in probably 8831 I would assume that yeah one or nine I'm not sure I think it might make the next one but yeah we'll see but yeah either way it's going to get even easier to configure this yeah correct yeah you won't have to enable the remote proxy um but but if you're going to be connecting domes via an sdx or epx um in a um in a Wan environment where it's going in on the WAN either here or in this in this design you have to enable that remote proxy so these domes can connect it can can properly uh access the the Sim injector on the Lan of a of a host unit so um so the next design is this guy right here by far the easiest and if I was going to do a real-time demonstration this would be it um you plug in the The Sim injector you put in a SIM card into it you give it power and it'll it'll the status will stay flashing this is what's really cool about the Sim injector the fly the status will stay flashing until it gets an IP address so you know that it's searching like if it's flashing it means it doesn't it can't get an IP address from the from an upstream Dome then you plug in your Dome the Dome is going to power up it's going to then offer DHCP the Sim injector is going to snag an IP address from the Dome and then you're going to have a connection the satellite the status light will now go solid Additionally you can then once that Dome is online you'll have your AP it can go into this and it's going to get an IP address from the Dome as well the Dome is a router so everything you need all the brains right built right into that that Dome and so this is let me just close this out close this out okay Sim injector 56 there we go so here's my HD1 Dome my sim injector and my AP1 Enterprise if it is important to understand that the sub injector is not it is a very limited process processor a common complaint is how do I know what's on the Sim ejector I can't manage the Sim injector in control doesn't happen as a reporting for like the ports and stuff on the Sim injector one there are some some features coming in control um I was running some beta software I did see something earlier um but in touch I can click on my SIM injector here and I can manage my sim injector from in control via in touch this at least gives you the visibility of your sim cards and the clients that are connected to it so you can see what's going on I can pull this up and I get my imsi my ICC ID I can see pen status is disabled and the other slots are empty so I know and then here you can see right here connected that's the Dome that's connected to the SIM card so I can see the Dome that's connected to this SIM card um and so even though this information is not being pulled up into in control it's a very nice to be able to use InTouch to access these Lan iot devices to be able to pull this information in I just wanted to throw that out there as a just a bonus perk of uh of in touch okay so so once you have it physically wired up the I had to hook a laptop up right because you got to tell the the Dome to use the Sim injector and that's one of the things um to be aware of in this scenario or actually even in the epx scenario um I did uh take my laptop like I ethernet connected into the Sim injector um which gave me an IP address and then I logged into my router so so imagine this is 192.168.50.1 so I logged into the router and this is very very easy to do so with the SIM injector on the Lan of a device where the device is the router The Hub um there's no additional programming necessary you simply click on your cellular module and tell it which port to use it and the serial number of your sim injectors so I put it on the bottom of the Sim injector as a serial number I put in the serial number colon the port which is Port one I can tell it to use multiple ports and I can tell it's a fail over those boards with bandwidth allowance monitor or with acceptable signal threshold so if I have a t T-Mobile and Verizon and my acceptable level is three bars of service it will fail over appropriately or if it can't connect on one it will then reconnect on two or reconnect on three um so you can use uh your the router the the modem options to fail over multiple SIM injector or multiple SIM cards in the remote sound so um that does work additionally if you have physical stem cards in the device you can set priorities and and say hey use remote Sim first then some B then send a or whatever you want to do there um and turn those on and off um so you can't you know um so but other than that you hit save and apply and that's all you have to do and then queer you'll see the the Sim slot uh one start flashing and then it'll say you know with LTE bars and then it'll connect to your carrier and then you're online so the Sim injector with a dome very easy there's no Advanced options or settings you just simply put in the serial number of the uh the Dome if you want the optional Port colon one or colon two um if you don't want to do that if you just want to search all your sim cards you can just leave the colon blank and it'll just randomly grab an available uh SIM card that's in the Sim injector I I don't find that to be super reliable I don't do that but but it does work um and and then I went into back into in control once it was online and then I just went into Wi-Fi group wide Wi-Fi settings set up my Wi-Fi so uh Sim injector 56 volt Wi-Fi and then push it out to the AP and that was it I'm going to add one more thing that I did do um The Sim injector is relatively new technology and peplink is actually it does have firmware um and so you can go to peplink.com and this is more of a plug for for peplink support so I just want to throw it out there you have some amazing Engineers that are constantly improving and making the technology better and uh don't start blushing but you know it you you pebbling support is phenomenal and the other thing too is I can go to support firmware downloads no serial number no username and password no proof of purchase here is all the the latest Hardware or firmware for all the devices so I click Sim injector and there's my firmware I've got uh 1.1.115 1.1.103 and 1.0.25 and the reason they do this you have if you're running prior if you boot up a Sim injector and it's running one zero two four you have to go to two five first do not go straight to one one one five it won't work it'll fail so you want to go one zero two five then one one oh three then one one one five um so you do want to upgrade uh in in series there um which is the reason why they're all sitting right there and then if you want to see what's different you can download the PDF of the release notes and see what they've improved um so uh you click download and then I used in touch once again so I just plugged in that Dome or you can either log in locally once you know the ip1921 state 50.11 for me um and then use InTouch and then I just logged into the router and pushed the latest uh 115 firmware and so uh very easy to do uh if I let me see if I can find that show you how I did that because that's the purpose of these videos so I'm gonna log into that Sim injector remotely you go to settings firmware and I just choose file and Boot It Up one one five so and then that's it so um uh so that's and that's all I did update the firmware Point into HD1 Dome to the router and then it all came online and in control and then I set the Wi-Fi SSID um and uh and in control for the AP so now I'm going to go to my br2 Pro 5G demo uh the br2 pro 5G is using the Sim injector mini um once again uh the Sim injector uh I this one I left off of in control because I wanted to demonstrate the InTouch capabilities but also uh making it nice and clean I I am a massive fan of the br2 pro 5G I think it's one of the coolest routers peplic has made in a long time which is hard to say because the apx the STX Pro the 2500 EC I mean there's a lot of good routers but portability uh it's a 12 volt system so let's see if I can bring this over here to my my desk and show off a little bit so I have the I'm trying to do this as nicely as possible I apologize everybody um so what what I have is the br2 pro 5G but the SIM cards are back here and it's really hard to reach so if you can imagine this mounted in a vehicle or mounted on a on a shelf trying to reach behind to get the SIM SIM cards is a pain in the butt I'm sorry I probably shouldn't say that on camera is a pain in the neck and so I took a Sim injector plugged it in Via 12 volt and so I've got a power button right here and you can see my my power button light use the red power button light right there so the power the 12 volt power comes in to my power button splits off and goes to the br2 pro 5G and the Sim injector Lan cable goes from the uh Sim injector right to the br2 pro 5G and then I programmed it so let me show you how I programmed it foreign okay So br2 Pro 5G um I plugged in the the the the the Sim injector went to Client List and I can see Hey where's my maybe because I'm zoomed in so much oh I've already programmed in touch so I apologize so there's a button right here in touch so you can click InTouch which will then take you into the in touch configuration majority programmed up and then I've set up the Sim injector mini let me see here um oh wrong Client List go to go to the device go to clients there we go action in touch so you can see there's my sim injector 192 wants to say 50.10 I click in touch it takes me to the InTouch configuration and I just have the Sim injector HTTP 1921 say 5010 colon 80 and then there it is right there Sim injector mini I click play or go and I can log right right into this Sim injector mini I updated the firmware to one one one one five and I have two SIM cards in here because the br2 pro 5G has two modems so I've got my sim injector Mini and I've got two SIM cards installed so there they are right there and you can see that it's connected to the same serial number there's my my br2 Pro slot zero or modem zero and modem one so the first one the second one um binary by the way or most things they start with zero as the first number so um so there's my two connected right there and then on the router so once again I had to do with a laptop connected um because obviously with the SIM injector you got to tell it to use the modem so it's not going to come online so you do have to do this with a we should do something where it has like an auto discover Sim injector you know that'd become a fun feature uh um and so there here's my br2 Pro 5G pull up cellular once again because I'm on the Lan the Lan um all I did is put in the serial number of the Sim injector mini colon one and then on this one I did the serial number the Sim injector mini colon 3 because I'm using the top two so it's one and three it's one two three four five six seven eight uh kind of up down and it's all used one and three and um it came online I then went to speed Fusion connect set up my bonding you can see it right there with Dynamic weighted bonding I went to my Advanced outbound policies set a policy to send all the traffic to speed Fusion connect and now I have a VR2 Pro 5G with two SIM cards uh plugged into the Sim injector mini uh online and this this kit as it sits right here well I'll add more SIM cards uh T-mobile ATT but as it sits right here it's going to go with me to Houston tomorrow uh for my install so like this is my kit that I travel and I'm I love that Sim injector mini and the ability just to easily swap SIM cards and modify the SIM cards it's incredibly convenient so um I I am available I think that's the end of the demo um uh the three scenarios with a little bit of extras we do have some cooler technology coming um uh some Cloud management capabilities hopefully coming soon right right Travis maybe I can ping you a little bit on that so yeah absolutely so you know I think there's some questions here about there's some finer grain tools in the built-in Sim slots on bandwidth allowance and some other ways that you can kind of prioritize with SIM cards and so the cloud system is going to enable some more advanced controls there also enable some geography based control so if you're one of those um scenarios that you move around like you know on a ship port to port you're gonna be changing countries that's another great example of where you need to to use these but um you're going to need some geography Geographic aware capabilities there so there's going to be a cloud layer to add a lot more of that flexibility and control and really enhance that software-defined aspect to it I can't wait to make that video the uh yeah so yeah we're on the cloud and then we also have what if someone has more than 56 SIM cards I mean do we we have an option for that we do yes more is pretty much always a yes at that point right so we've got the uh we've got a rack appliance that has 448 SIM card slots in it um so when you start getting into that kind of you know remotely distributed architecture that's where you really start loading those up and you might have redundant pairs of those in different data centers things like that but yeah there's a lot more capabilities here though that we're just really starting to scratch the surface on but one of the things I love about peplink is your Innovation right and we're just constantly innovating to solve unique challenges um and so the the superstation uh you know the ability to have Cloud management geolocation for the remote Sims these features just make it easier and better and more powerful to to deploy networks anywhere which is what peplink has done I mean the whole idea is deploying a Network anywhere uh and it's been the the basis of my entire company and the work that we do is solving unique connectivity challenges and that is what the Sim injector and and this modems and the different cards and the different devices and appliances that are made are that that's what they all make that's what they provide is that they're a national enable not provide they enable the that diversity and just the ability to deploy anywhere yeah with with 5G and low earth orbit satellites the the ability to actually get a connection anywhere is more and more possible and so yeah being able to manage them prioritize that and control that Keith asked a question about why the value of 56 I hope I just answered that Keith um it's not the official topic of this this webinar but the idea is is connecting that to the cloud is really the idea and that's coming um yeah and that's you know burning through data plans that's roaming that's there's lots of lots of scenarios that you know may not be day-to-day for you or I but you know mobile command broadcasters Mobile Medical um those are just a few examples of people that we see off burning through data plans and also the the other thing too is my deployments of the Sim injector uh 56 usually I have 12 or 14 or more uh HD1 domes we do some pretty big deployments with High throughput needs um with a 56 Bay just it's a single module that lets you manage a bunch of SIM cards it's very convenient um yeah you know when you're trying to connect something really critical really high bandwidth you know one connection to one carrier isn't any different than somebody else on their phone right you're just another user on the network in that case so that's why you're deploying multiple domes for the same carrier and you're getting more and more cracks at at the bandwidth on each of those carriers and um you know realistically that's how you enable these really Advanced demanding applications is you just need more pipes and more chances to get that bandwidth uh yeah Danny uh you asked for uh VSS uh the visual studio sense uh visual uh Vizio stencils uh my marketing team made those uh so uh you could ask them if they want to share them with you but um yeah it's something we've been working on every new product it's a new Vizio stencil um so you can reach out to I think it's marketing at westnetworks.com and uh Olivia could probably share that with you uh real real world use case um Mike Turner uh I should have said last thing I apologize Mike Mike asked about the real world use case of the ROI I hope we just did that um that was the idea behind it um is that is that there's there's increased scalability here that goes well beyond just like a super yacht it might have one one HD1 Dome or one device that this goes into like our mobile mammography where we have like 16 modems and we're trying to manage not only connectivity to carrier diversity but also gigabytes we're trying to do all three at the same time high throughput carrier diversity I um I just this morning did a site survey for a company up to Kentucky where we need four or five T-Mobile 18t and Verizon's each all being aggregated to provide enough throughput to do what they want to do this deflects module uh the Sim injector Flex module what enables that ability for us to have those SIM cards um as well and make it simple for the client to manage so not to mention the remote capabilities but also just the the girth of the requirement I think one other thing too is sometimes it's not a dollars and sense thing sometimes the the return on investment is purely operational Simplicity right sometimes it's still an important Commission yeah for them to be able to you know use this in a manner that doesn't require I.T every day to automate those those you know so you can automate those events that that's often really the driver is not saving money it's saving people and time and in improving that that user experience too um uh Topher asked a great question bandwidth allowance monitor is coming it's not supported on RSM that was my bad on during the video the signal threshold is supported remote bandwidth monitoring is a SIM card feature um but it is coming um and I do apologize I when I stated that in the video that is incorrect and you correct uh corrected that uh is there any words to privatize some injector particular you can prioritize them based on the order like I mentioned um so someone asked if you can prioritize The Sims if you put them in order on the remote sem you have one three and four or whatever it will then use those in order it'll either try and then fail and then reconnect or you can use the sliding graph of the sliding signal to make you fail over um otherwise yeah you did earlier but I'd like to just show that because yeah that that oh yeah on that list of yeah so and it's actually kind of easy to tell and that's where I screwed up you see how cellular settings the bandwidth allowance monitors inside cellular settings and that feature is not enabled when we set the cellular settings but signal threshold setup settings and Smart Check are their own so if you set the signal threshold to three bars and you have ATT and T-Mobile and Verizon Sims listed as slots here so if this was a t which it is and then I had a Verizon and then I had a T-Mobile then based on the signal threshold it's going to connect to ATT first and then if it fails it'll connect to Verizon or T-Mobile additionally if it can't connect to the network if it can't establish a connection it will then fail over as well so if I drive through an area that doesn't have one of the carriers it'll then fail over to the next one so you can have multiple SIM cards here the bandwidth allowance monitor that's I believe that's coming to to FSM um is the idea there like the Geo and the the monitoring of the usage is going to be Cloud because right now because it's a remote Sim technology we need a central platform to manage the total use of that data so it's not effective on a SIM card like this where we have no database to track the utilization of each and every SIM card in the art and the Sim injector so so those are your fellow your current failover mechanisms um the someone asked about the performance with bonding speed Fusion it performs no differently than a SIM card plugged directly into the router um so it's gonna be based on coverage location and area so speed Fusion is going to be just based on the the availability of that of of what's what's what you're currently using it won't it won't function any shouldn't function any different than a SIM card plugged into the router versus a SIM card plugged into the Sim injector three so one question about e-sim support yes there is plans to add esim support to the Sim injectors as well so you could additionally assign an esim into that injector in the future that's not right now but um that Sim injector mini does have the hardware support for it um so yeah more to come on that one yeah and then next question would be our I demonstrated the br2 but not the br1 um you just go and check the device compatibility list so I believe we were talking about that um and actually in templink's own slides they actually demonstrated a br1 pro 5G so um I would assume that the br1 pro 5G also works um and then here we go um compatible devices so these are the devices that all support the Sim injector so mbx 5G mbx mbx mini PDX br1 classic Hardware threes the new hardware three one the br1 ESN the br1 pro uh uh Hardware five and six Cat four and Cat uh Cat6 the br2 pro the br1 ip55 HD2 mini um HD1 Dome HD1 Dome Pro HD2 Dome HD2 IP67 Transit transfer Pro e Transit core ubr LTE ubr plus which I have one of those speed Fusion engine Hardware two are above and the speed Fusion cam um so just check your check your Hardware um the compatibility but if you don't have the whole Red Bar as far as it knows if you don't have a little red thing at the bottom says it doesn't support R7 you should be fine um so I believe is the the official like how peplink is handling that so um demonstrated answer live uh remote router Sim injection data center uh the the remote router so if you have like the remote deployment capabilities like the remote router the idea is you have a public IP address and then you're you're basically connecting those in um uh once again we're building this Cloud infrastructure it's really going to make that cleaner um the best use case I've seen for it is actually using speed Fusion to connect and then and then basically accessing the speed the Sim injector via speed Fusion but the remote the remote connectivity capabilities coming in is a little messy uh which is why we've built in this Cloud environment and so I think you're going to see and do we have any ETA for that uh Travis at all like the cloud capabilities of the Sim injector I don't have a specific ETA on that yet no um okay uh briefcase is really cool it's just a Pelican case and we pull the equipment to it um not super anything super special there um we use a v-mount battery we do sell them called speed Fusion cases but I don't this is not about sales so uh but it's just a Pelican case with a br2 pro 5G a battery and antenna 's um very easy to make and clean um it's just uh it's very cool I carry it with me everywhere take it on airplanes um I like it like on airplanes because all the parts are visible so TSA freaks out I just open it and they can see it um all the parts uh so for TSA I goes to TSA just fine um and uh is really clean so um one I think we're out of time two if you have any additional questions you can always reach out to Traverse or myself um uh my email address is Peter westnetworks.com or sales westnetworks.com we'll get to my whole team uh Travis uh is your email published or you have a preferred Graphics at peplink.com Travis peplink.com so Travis peplink.com or uh or sales westnetworks.com and we'd be more than happy to answer any additional questions uh there are a lot of use cases and deployment I and there were people that asked questions about bonding and performance this topic is really about the technology related to the injector which is why I ignored those I do apologize for ignoring those it's just that I wanted to stay focused on the injector um technology uh and not get because I can talk about performance for for hours um so yeah I think the important thing there is just the performance is not impacted here right yeah yeah how you're inserting the SIM card so it doesn't have any change on 5 your 4G on you know is this a speed Fusion thing is it going to slow it down it's exactly the same as putting it in that Sim slot other than how you assign it to that to that device so it is no change compared to using that Sim directly installed Peter uh asked a question about physical stems and sharing Sims um as long as it's in the injector you can share it over the weekend um so I kind of quasi-answered that but the answer is yes and share meaning not two devices at once one right yeah yeah one device per sem card out it's no such thing as two devices one sim card simultaneously yeah once it starts flashing once the syn injector starts flashing on that card no other device can talk to and then it can talk to it yep um and then yeah and then any any additional questions um you know like I said please feel free to reach out to traps or myself and be more than happy to to set up a more in-depth conversation and uh thank you so much for for for joining us on another uh peplink University Tech call yeah absolutely thank you Peter and again thank you everyone for joining in a month next month and if you have any ideas email us uh there's something you want us to talk about uh we just pick what we like so if there's something you want us to demonstrate or talk about please email Travis or myself be more than happy to put in the queue or prioritize it um but basically we just decide what technology we think is worth sharing and trying to Deep dive so um please if there's something else you want to learn uh email Travis or myself and we'll we'll uh we'll evaluate if it's if it's something we think the community wants to know so all right folks have a great day thanks again bye"}

yourselves so my name is Cassie we are from public and then today's we got the webinar is about the firmware 8.0 we just released this webinar uh for uh four weeks and then now we will have some uh this weapon I actually will share with you what is news and uh some work through uh maybe some information about the features so uh today's week invite uh our uh our Europe our district our district our vid distributor our continuity to help us to deliver the uh the switch and then share with you all about the firmware things so uh our key speaker is Joey Joey uh I know that you and your team will help for will support for this weapon can you also introduce um your teammates yes thank you thank you Cassie uh yes I'm Joey a senior technical engineer for Frontier uh I've done a few videos already on YouTube and this is the first full webinar for for peplink um with me today uh is Yannick uh Yannick is also an engineer here at Frontier and Steve and Steve is also an engineer uh with Frontier UK um so that's a really nice lineup today yeah and of course we have our highly value director who's managing all the questions for uh from you guys all today so yeah yeah really good lineup okay Lynn I think uh yeah we let's start today's uh webinar yeah yes all right welcome everybody Welcome to uh the webinar about the forever 8.3.0 um so we're going to discuss the new features and changes that have been made by the chaplain team they worked really hard on this um for for quite some time so uh it's really pleasure to talk about that today and uh hopefully uh you guys know a little bit more about the new firmware so this firmware version of babink as as I said many new features and innovations that will come useful in many applications before we start there are a few households like I said Sandra is responsible for the Q a we will have a q a session after after the webinar is done so we will be answering all of your questions uh if needed after the most of the webinar um and yeah like I said my colleague Steve and Yannick are also here um they will be uh answering with me the questions uh at a later date so first off uh the first feature that we want to discuss today is synergy mode well it is a fun to your favorites we have waited some time for this feature and I I must say I made a small gym when I knew this was introduced because we've been waiting for this a long time and we're really enthusiastic about this um with Synergy modes you could configure other pebbling routers as if they're integrated van interfaces so this feature has two two options uh you have a synergize device and a Synergy controller the um synergize device will act as the WAN source so that's also shortened by SD if you look at the documentation on pappling forum and the Synergy controller and also shortened as SC this energy controller is the brain to manage all synergize devices when interfaces including ethernet van Wi-Fi event and cellular RN so all of the brands on the synergize device will appear as a native fan interface so if you have a mbx which has maybe four or two cellular modems and it can go up to three events two USB when it to Wi-Fi when if you have the mbx as a synergized device you will see that on your let's say balance sdx as all of the available bands so what do you need to set this up so you must at least have of course 8.3.0 firmware that's really useful both sorry both the synergize device and uh Synergy controller must be running the same firmware version that's also really important so if you have a maybe a later 8.3.1 or a 9.0 firmware and the Synergy controller is still running 8.3.0 you need to update that um you need also need to have a care plan so you need to have an active care plan the system will validate the device's subscription prior to activating Synergy mode this will allow for Synergy mode with one capable device without a care plan with no extra of course but you need to have the synergize controller with active care plan so the Synergy controller must have at least one active land source so you need to have one backup when available um this is so that they can reach in control because in control is not necessarily needed you don't need to put the device in in control but it needs to have an Uplink 2 in control to start the process both synergize device and synergize controllers must be able to do that um to start off you need to have the synergize device completely clean which means that you do a reset once you have updated from 8.3 and you cannot make any changes to that not even the admin password when connecting to the synergize controller so there must be no nothing be done on that so please make sure you have disabled any existing in control provision settings on the synergize device because that will overrule your standards configuration so if any group level configurations are in place make sure that you filter out the synergize devices by adding attack and don't uh allow the attack to be managed so the supported devices for this energy controller and the synergize devices there are a few differences so I've put them on screen and there are a lot of to name out but in all Prime Care devices are able to do function as a synergize controller and device but accepting the ubr LTE in a Transit Mini free balance routers basically all could be as used as a Synergy controller uh for for for large minority I must say um and for the max relatives there's also a really long list um but all the X Series are available to use as a Synergy controller and for the synergize devices the X Series are now only supported by the mbx platform mbx mini and PDX platform so an apx or an sdx or sdx Pro is not supported by as a synergize device you can still use it as a Synergy controller so all of that there's a lot of options and of course don't forget that all of the Max and balanced routers and prompted voices must be running 8.3 product to work so if the device is not capable of upgrading to 8.3.0 then you have an issue all right this is this is for uh Synergy mode um taplink also made some changes to the um speed Fusion and mainly in the bombing part so Dynamic weight of bonding is now a default option for new speed Fusion bundling profiles which means that the older normal bonding mode is still available it doesn't it's it's not removed but it's now as a secondary option for you to choose so what is this um Dynamic way to bonding it's already introduced in 8.2.0 but uh with 8.3 print oh it's now the standard bonding feature um so Dynamic weight bonding is peplink's Introduction to make bombing work even better in 4G or 5G environments so that the bonding default algorithm had some small issues with and and particularly bonding 4G 5G connections and that increases significantly better better bloat issues when talking about buffer blow it's all about latency if your when latency increases while sending data the dynamic rated booming algorithm will monitor it and reduce the present day the percentage of the packages going to this link to avoid it from becoming too congested so this is this is helping to minimize the congestion on your speed Fusion connection Dynamic weight bombing also identifies bad links this means that when a link is performing or stability is not perfect um it won't be part of the bonded tunnel so no my user packages will be sent over that when to when Link in that speed Fusion tunnel so this prevents the overall performance from being affected by when that is not performing well such as moving mobile router with one of the LTE connections that go to an area that has a weak signal so default bonding is is a common use and if you test it with TCP streams the latency will keep increasing without losing a package moment the buffer is exhausted on the ISP side Legacy will reach the maximum value and start dropping packages because later C is so high TCP returns missions would take a long time to kick in so overall throughput is lower and flick Choice a lot this new algorithm takes care of before loads by monitoring the real-time data scene Compares it to the latency when it's idle and Trust the packages before the latest it gets too high the packet loss can be acknowledged by the sender as fast as possible on results in a stable overall throughput for the TCP streams so is there any questions so far so I can rest a bit their voice can you maybe answer those questions because now we have actually some questions uh already answered in the chat let me read out the questions socially or the the panelists team can help to answer so we got um we get the questions from Edwin saying that do you need Prime Care and essential care for Synergy mode can you answer when you have a Prime Care device I'm not sure that's more warranty uh stuff than technical um not sure if that's needed for the devices actually it depends on what because we got Synergy controller and we also got uh this uh the scene Synergy dice devices so it depends on which one uh if you need a Synergy controller if you need the prime tier then you will have one license yeah to work on this so um so this is a we need the PrimeCare model if this is license related um so uh maybe we should continue where we left off sure if you're okay let's continue first we can translate cool sorry about that so the next uh the next one in the speech version is the TCP ramp up modes um TCP Rampart mode is a new feature for a new TCP connections if you have a TCP connection as you can see on the left a normal speed test is pin one and you see that the the the throughput is fairly starting from from zero to eventually rating up to 156 Megs of throughput on the right you see the TCP Rampart mode in TCP ramp up modes starts already with 16 mags of Troopers and what this does it applies for a short period of time a when smoothing so you use more bands at the same time instead of using just one ram at at any time so this is increasing the TCP um throughput in the beginning of a TCP session and it prevents packet loss during TCP slow starts the next thing on the list is virtual when and this is a also a new feature that was introduced in 8.2.1 but only for the balance 20x but now it's landed on all devices that can run 8.3.0 with PrimeCare devices and one virtual bank connection is included and you can go up to three virtual wins per device and up to 25 licenses for an apx keep in mind that using Synergy mode on a virtual one is not supported which public models can you use this license with the virtual when license can only be used with all PrimeCare models except the ubr LTE and so is it meaning and all other devices that are able capable of running 8.3.0 so for example a balanced return X or an mbx can run up to 10 virtual events so that's it for virtual one so these cellular changes sublink has made a lot of improvements on several events so for example you can now use two by two mode for the 5gh8 or cats only devices and you can now finally select your carrier on 5G models which is a really frequently Asked feature from our customers also the max adapter is supported now as a cellular ran interface not as a USB interface so that's also a really good improvement from the Babbling team and of course signal thresholds are now added on the 5G models which means that now you have the option to select your signal threshold the changes to the balance 20x because the balance 20x has also got a few changes apart from the already introduced uh it has also now Wi-Fi when so you can use now the Wi-Fi module as a advanced source just as you would like to do on a mbx or b01 Pro 5G also the balance 20xs now Laura van support so this is also a really nice feature and to dive deeper into that yeah you can basically make together with rural run a really nice stable iot Network because you combine the perfect speed Fusion capabilities of the public device to your already existing lower event or you can create a lower end network with the Gateway so this is introducing peplink to the iot mock so the supported bands for the lower van are in the AU au868 in865 ru864 and for the US models there is a us-915 Au 915 as923 as925 and KR 920 so you can now create the power of that link to your iot network which is really nice also in Deutsche already introduced an 8.2 points or 8.2.1 um and this is um already launched in April 2022 actually um and now you have the option to add USB in touch to your device and this is really useful as Steve maybe can explain a bit more to to to show or name a few case studies uh Steve if you can yes so this is a great new feature it allows uh within Touch of course you can access or give people access to devices that are on the land side of the pep link so uh you know if you've got Engineers that are supporting a CCTV system uh you can give them access to the system without giving them complete access to everything on the network and of course they can do that remotely with the USB in touch support this now extends that capability to uh USB and serial devices so there's a lot more capability now with this this new feature so it just extends the flexibility of the um of in touch and of course allows more remote support for your devices that are within your network without actually having an engineer turn up all without giving that engineer complete access to everything on your network yes indeed thanks thanks Steve yeah maybe in coupling Park we will let us share with you some interesting story of in touch um yeah before we have the in touch features actually uh we think that maybe this is um some some uh user maybe want to use uh in control or use our pipeline devices to do some of them management then when we develop and then we just say hey this feature may be just a um a a social features that maybe not everyone will be interested in and then maybe oh in touch things maybe they just saying this is something like a a just a setup of VPN to do this but now actually for the in touch um we when we release this uh actually this is not the first release but we have some improved update features when we first release the in touch then we discovered that oh the people uh because of Interest they use uh they buy the uh they Continuous Care plans or they continues they want to the ic2 license that they in the originally they do not use it but now they use this to control actually for the InTouch if you um if you just go deep into it and this is the features that you can just use it um to use product in control to control your IP devices and then you can not only to control uh to go into the uh to go into the IP devices interface but you can also have some setting on how to change the IP address in in the networking uh in the internet Network so I think this um this is a interesting um interesting features that you can try if you have time yeah especially if you've got some IP device at your uh in your network so yeah this is what the that's just sharing yeah thank you Cassie nice nice okay um so that's about USB support for InTouch um apart from in Dutch um there's also been some security features and updates added to the public routers for example the diagnostic report has been uh enhanced of the sorry the pampling theme has enhanced the encryption for the diagnostic report and the configuration file is now encrypted so that means that you're no longer um should be worried about somebody else stealing the device and and stealing the configuration file so that's a really nice feature from the pep Bank team so please know that this uh configuration file is now no longer supported if it's encrypted by 8.3.0 firmware it's no longer usable with 8.2.1 devices so if you want to migrate that configuration file it's no longer possible to just move it back to a older version that's not supported uh by that older version firmware a few other small features and improvements um in general cellular improvements are made on the cellular modems to have them work better Wi-Fi brand now supports IP forwarding open VPN when it's now fixed to save and enforce album policy rule on the open VPN the transit pro has been renamed to transfer to a pro uh uterine seller ID smmp supports uterine cell artery deep packets investigation session logging now is included into that and the GPS an option to turn off a GPS or GPS forwarding services so this is a bit about the new changes in 8.3.0 if now is the time to to answer your questions Jana can you answer the question of David maybe publicly yeah sure I'm I'm typing the entire thing um but the two by two uh option is still a little bit in a beta of functionality um within the firmware but basically what it does if you have a 5G modem which um uses four antenna connectors and you only have the option to use a 2x2 antenna uh to well physically connect to antenna connectors um with this option you can tell the router slash modem um that there are only two antennas connected to the modem at that point where this would be um uh only those antenna connectors would be used there are different modems public uses in different types of products and with the gemalto modems there is a fixed um diagram of which antenna connectors can be connected to which of the antenna connectors on the peplink device they are the two by two option works really well as these are fixed with the Shara wireless modems um it's a little bit more tricky based on the frequencies that you use depends on which antenna connector is used so therefore the two by two option is I think less relevant to use but as it is incorporated into the firmware it's still available so depending on the modem and depending on the frequencies you use the option is there to use or better not to use if you need to know which type of antenna connectors are can be used or the the the physically the connectors on the peplink device can be used you can send us an email we can give you these uh these diagrams as well I don't have them on hand right now with this presentation but they are all available if need and it will type it anyway because I was almost done that's okay um and question from Michael about the GPS why would you turn off or on the GPS well in some occasions you don't want to be having extra traffic going over your network if you use a really expensive connection so you want to minimize the amount of data going on a GPS code of could be something to help that also in some occasions the GPS not needed or is not allowed to be used so that's why you might want to turn the GPS off I hope that that helps your your question I I heard the party um some of the Synergy mode so maybe can you please uh briefly uh again repeat what is simply mode yeah yeah so Synergy mode is um an option to add different ones from different routers into your core router yeah this is useful for uh you when you tell the customer or user that hey your old pipeline device can be used with that new prepping devices yeah because when a lot of uh existing customer they do not want to upgrade their devices but if you tell them hey you can just uh you can just put your own uh existing device to the new one then you can do the upgrade yeah yeah and then so uh some people are asking do we need a care plan can you please go for this session yes so you the Synergy controller must have an active care plan to uh make that that Synergy connection um the system uh will validate the devices subscription prior to activating so if you press that button uh on the when tab in your web admin then you will have um uh if you click that then it's checking if there is a care plan available or not and the good thing about it is additional synergize devices we'll need um a care plan as well um to to to see that feature work yeah yeah so if you got one uh Prime uh Prime Care models activate then you at least you can have one uh console you can control one uh synergize the devices yeah I think the the question from Casper I think Steve and can you answer that one about the chance to do a produce yeah okay so uh is it harmful to operate the transit view Duo on one Wi-Fi only whilst not physically having connected the four standard antennas uh it's fine uh you can operate the transit Geo just on on one and Wi-Fi whilst you don't have the cellular antennas connected of course uh it's not going to be able to use those um cellular modems that are in the transit Duo whilst you don't have any antennas connected but it's not going to cause any harm okay um I think it's a really good question um so Yannick I see another question about starlink yes I can see yeah yeah you're ready okay cool if you have a starlink and two times a 4G sim would you recommend Dynamic bonding or bonding and how does stalactic perform with TCP accelerators well it is possible uh to do bonding of course um the Starling system also has a latency comparable with LTE networks you know around 40 to 80 milliseconds is is is doable uh because primarily the bonding feature is very sensitive to latency differences the big problem with starlink is is when the Starling satellite switches from a different uh Leo satellite there you can see that there are some packet drops when it switches so depending on the uh application that you're using the starlink satellite for uh depends if this will work well uh definitely use Dynamic bonding as it can it can differ because you're also using the 4G Sims and even if you're only using those Dynamic bonding would work better than the normal bonding feature when you incorporate a stalling satellite as well this will not uh make it work better with the normal bundling situation if you're still using a wireless communication you're still using a link that is uh latency sensitive and you're still using a link that could have a packet loss on the line so yes it should work it can work and you should use the dynamic bonding feature uh Steve I uh I got a question for you for you how do you see fertile when being used um in in some scenarios right um virtual one is uh is a great way you're actually adding additional wands to devices that don't actually have more Wan ports like the balance 20x so um you can use that to add more connections so I think there's a there's an example on the Forum which gives uh two isps coming into a switch and then that switch go into a lan port on the balance 20x which is actually then your Wang so you have your standard Wan port on the balance 20x and then you have a lan port with two isps connected via a switch giving you three Wands on your balance 20x which is a great addition great feature and of course that applies to the the devices with PrimeCare apart from I think it's the ubr LTE and the transit mini if it's got a PrimeCare license uh founded PrimeCare you can you can use that feature yes yeah you have one uh active without purchasing any other licenses yeah um yeah uh Yannick do you have any cases within the maritime about uh virtual when you see it's going to be a really nice feature to be to edit and and where do you see it used you mean virtual weather using Synergy mode virtual event sorry yeah um well I'm I'm more a fan of the Synergy mode to be honest yeah I mean uh using coupling devices with the Synergy mode to a core router uh and having availability to connect devices without using a lot of coaxial cables in my opinion that would be the most useful feature in Maritime industry the most difficult things usually are placing antennas running long wires to a central location where your hd4 HD2 or Etc is is something that is always uh problematic or at least giving lower signal strengths Etc so when using Synergy mode with a balanced 380x 580x or something like that and then using uh HD one domes HD2 domes or even internal units with external antennas but different places on the vessel so we can use ethernet Poe and not use long coaxial cables for the maritime industry that is in my opinion the best use case for this new technology so to be honest yeah I'd rather use that and of course of course if you have all of those synergized device connected to your web ports you still need something to add your stalling to it and if you don't have enough Imports left then you can use the virtual win of course yes of course I would still prefer buying a unit that has enough Wan ports but so if if the if it's already there on the vessel then yes of course it's it's a great feature to uh to to use um that at least we have the availability uh to incorporate a virtual flexibility as well yeah yep yes really really cool thank you I see we have another question um with using an antenna combiner I'm not sure if that's a combiner and an amplifier or just a single combiner but um be careful with using combiners um because they can cause uh Plus on the correctional cable solution but in general uh it the two by two antenna modes is might be a better solution if you have two antennas available only Steve going back to you um Synergy mode um do you have any use cases that you could use uh Synergy modes in as we have already heard from Yannick about um the uh Maritime sector yeah I mean the maritime is going to be the big winner here with Synergy mode but um I've seen this used in construction as well and even in office environments where you might have a a poor ads outline coming in and then you want to have a couple of cellulars maybe that's a br1 mini giving you some cellular connectivity or a dome on a roof somewhere on an office block giving you additional connectivity um with Synergy mode now you can use your ADSL line to give you that direct link to in control to do all the validation but then you can use those faster uh Cellular Connections for your day-to-day connectivity and business use so I think it's a great addition and allows you to manage and control all of those ones by your single controller device um so you don't need to be logging in to everything and of course the benefit here is you can make changes to the cellular modem on your bl1 mini without fear of losing access to that br1 mini because you only have a Cellular Connection you still have that ethernet link directly to the bl1 mini via the Synergy controller so that you can access that bill with mini so you you have less fear of losing connection and we've all been there haven't we yes indeed indeed I've also seen it used in the event industry as well so if you have a large area to uh to cover uh that they're using multiple devices on you know different locations on site routing these back to a central core location and then using uh the Synergy mode as the core unit to manage your traffic distribution also there it's being used but it's a smaller Market uh than than the other ones where you know the need was a little bit higher but useful still also also the rapid deployments I think as the PDX also supported um you can you can add it to a PDX as a the PDX user message synergize controller and work with with adding stuff to the PDX really easy um so that could also be a case and also just simply adding a additional van if needed with the Synergy mode is also really nice just add it in make sure it's powered of course and then yeah it's um it's a really nice nice feature and it's one of the the biggest differences between 8.2.0 and 2.1 sorry uh as we've got that question I think features like Synergy mode like the full support of virtual band those are the the main differences between the the different firmwares um but also a really nice feature what we can do in the future with it um as as many different uh devices will come and paplink just keeps on improving their devices uh I think there's a whole new opportunity to be uh yeah to be done and with paplink and I think that's a really nice uh thing to look at ahead in the future of so in uh now we got a quick link here so in the landing page you've got kick into extra zero then you will see uh our firmware page for this actually we would say that um the main difference for X300 was the people's version is a big changes so we improved the connectivity experience for 5G especially also with star links by the dynamic speed Fusion protect now we got uh unlimited usage for uh uh yeah for this one and usually also what we mentioned about the dynamic with the bonding and especially we also mentioned about the fascial things are the two antenna mode and you can choose your preferred carrier modes so this is all related to fashion selling and then we also make more possibility of when options just like the Synergy mode we mentioned you can use the old devices to uh synergize them and then to work in your whole network and also the virtual end so you can turn some devices depends on if it is compatible or not from the land power to the web port and also the my subductor before we got a lot of feedback that they want to also control the master data easily in the ic2 now this is available and then uh yes and then we talked about the InTouch in touch is something that we can yeah uh the international actually the advanced feature is to help to support the USB to the serial adapter this will make it uh the it also can help the network to make it more uh it can make also control some old devices especially with the Zero part and yeah just some uh Advanced and uh enhancement now we we actually pipeline is we listen to the community what they need and then try to uh impact we heard a lot of people want to use the openvpn when so now we also add the side to side VPN mode to provide a more transparency to your clients so this is uh this is what we listen to the to the request and then we make the changes and some outbound policy we got some updates and yeah the Qs and the n80 detect and also we will have the speed Fusion wheeler is a new devices but uh this one we will have more information coming soon yeah and then of course uh yeah actually Julia or what should mentioned about some naming changes so now it's just uh make it here so I think uh what partly uh is uh for all the competitors they maybe they they charge you when you need to charge to pay for upgraded firmware but apparently uh at this at this moment we are still free for download so you can just always update your firmware to get the latest Enterprise features or the um Advanced uh internet uh uh Network features to that so yeah this is what I want to add on Joey things yeah yeah I was stuck here um yes um if there are any questions feel free to send them in quickly before we closing up um I think that um we've covered all of the things we wanted to cover today I want to thank publink um for the opportunity and I want to thank Steve Yonex sonder the panel list members uh for helping me today very good for us to here to share some new uh features of that and I saw one comment is saying that can you can we have some uh live stream uh actually we also had another uh other video showing some uh how to work on the uh on the step uh in uh for especially for the new firmware uh wafu so uh in after today maybe I'm not sure because uh we will send it out maybe tomorrow and then uh in the email you will receive the presentation and also uh this webinar with Collins plus uh one more walkthrough videos recording so this will what you will receive it and then if you you can know no more especially you can try on the Synergy mode you can try on the original uh features and also especially for the in touch anything else you want to ask out yeah please get the last chance otherwise we will end up the end of the session after two minutes I forgot to mention to someone that one of the other features within the new firmware is the TCP ramp up modes but I think we discussed it in the presentation right yes of course busy answering questions but okay great yeah yeah we did and if there's any other questions later you can always uh contact Uplink or contact from your uh and we will help you as best as we can yeah I think all good uh thanks for everyone joining today's webinar so yeah please um if you want to see the recording and then please wait for us our whole on days yeah we will send out the related materials or extra materials to you so thanks for continuity team for helping us to introduce our firmware yeah so oh we've got a last minute question um uh when I do like YouTube live with that VPN YouTube Studio says incoming data is low please tell me how to solve it um well it's a really good question uh though uh I think uh I don't know if Yannick can answer this question right away or we might need to come back to it yeah well do we have to see how the uh setup is being done um yeah I mean if the uh pep VPN is used that means we have a well like a site unit you know that's probably maybe using 4G or some sort of Uplink uh that needs to connect to another peplink device that is a fusion up a babbling balance somewhere in a data center a home office Etc and depending on the Uplink that is on the end point so the receiving end of the pep VPN tunnel or bonding tunnel that needs to connect to the YouTube uh server that is then need to be checked if that has enough upload bandwidth to support with it also the uplinks used on site combined need to have enough upload bandwidth to support the video stream and also with video streaming when using uh third-party software or Hardware to suffice you with the uplinks stream it's usually used with multicast traffic multicast traffic is not very useful within layer 3 routing tunnels so I would also advise in using a layer 2 VPN between the pep link and the other peplink that maybe supports giving you a higher throughput the less packet loss on the streaming streaming packets but we need a little bit more information to be honest to actually solve your problem so you can still send us an email to support it frontierbv.com will try to help you with setting up um this this streaming setup uh maybe better or at least different and see if we can help you with increasing the throughput to YouTube yes yes okay um I hope that answers the questions I think that's a really good one um yeah yeah we have another question just last minute questions any plans to support wire guards um as far as I know no we do support openvpn at the moment but what it's also always great to go to The Forum and put the feature request in uh if there are anybody else out there that also needs this uh they can fold it up and get the attention of the peplink team yes just like the openvpn we did not try to do this in day one but when we a lot of people racing this in the program the feature request session and then we listen and then we react this is what public oh yes as far as I know it's not on the roadmap but I'm not constantly daily checking it but I haven't heard of it to be honest so probably we'll need to phone it up yeah I'm from Petland I can tell you that yeah I tell you that we're constantly checking the feature requests don't worry yeah good well you just need more people to say you need it yeah okay yep yeah right yep science for everyone so I uh yeah again please uh if easiest way if you want to try out the firmware then you go to our peplink.com and then go to the uh one of the code uh Square uh promote type and then you can click for the firmware icon stream and then you can get the download links and then you can get the features uh more details when you click on uh the link in uh in the in the web page so thanks very much for BB team to help on today's webinar and then yeah we will see you soon in the next call in the next webinar thanks very much yes okay bye-bye"}

knows what they're doing now hey folks we got Professor P here Peter West is here to teach us more about peplink and today we're going to talk about in touch I'm Travis Derek thank you all for joining us we just played a video for you folks to kind of break down what InTouch is what it does and how it helps people and we're obviously going to dive into that topic today and talk about that in a lot more detail again these peplink University series really just focused on Hands-On how do you do these things with deplink we've got all these great features and this is this is our time to show you how to do that and how you can use this data day to help your customers so with that Peter I'm going to hand it over to you and we can dive in yes thank you and and I'm I I was introduced to in touch quite a while ago in this concept and it's kind of been around I believe uh 8.2.1 T like started allowing some in touch connectivity features and um and so in touch has been around but I don't think the value proposition of in touch is being adequately uh communicated and so we wanted to have this in touch um conversation because I feel like it's you know there's customers that have peplink are paying you know have essential care and in control and have uh speed Fusion connect or sfc protect and in touch replaces gear out there that allows out-of-band management uh for free really I mean if you're already paying for the pep link and you're already paying for essential care it's basically free um and so I I'm really excited to talk about this today so what is in touch in touch is out of band management centralized and in control that being said um configure anything from anywhere like you're there um basically out of band management for the techie people right um the idea with in ink touch is we have uh HTTP https SSH telnet VNC RDP and rs-232 capabilities via in control configurable dynamically on the Fly um and so you can access basically anything on your infrastructure uh right from in in right from in control uh even third-party devices I've got my Cisco switch here that I'm gonna I'm gonna show you guys here in a few minutes um yeah I think this is awesome because you know we've been we've had been control for like literally over a decade right we've been doing this Cloud management and you know zero touch provisioning right you just ship boxes all over the world and they magically just get programmed and configured you don't have to send people all over and in touch is really kind of like extending that capability beyond the pep link right to all the other stuff behind the pep link that you really that's the whole point of your your peplink network is to connect those devices and so yeah it's I agree Peter this is just exciting powerful technology and it's really just simple and easy to use and so um everybody's running peplink switches and peplink APS anyways I mean as much as we would love to pretend they are um they're not and so the ability to manage your entire infrastructure from a single plane of glass like uh like in control uh is is from I.T Administration standpoint it's really cool um so in touch eliminates the needs for engineers vpns servers extra typical um extra software typically needed to manage devices really here InTouch allows us to get rid of the management VLAN and or allows us to remove holes in our Network um there's no public IPS no firewalls to Oak ports to open up no default gateway to set up um this will work on non-gateway connected devices um and and that is pretty amazing uh to think about now you know if you have a an iot device that has an IP address and a subnet mask but no Gateway isn't routable to the internet that's okay because the pep link on that same VLAN is Layer Two so it can access that device even if there's no Gateway programmed yeah I think this is just one more step you know we see this a lot in our industry of you know peplink is helping people modernize all of their existing networks and so you can add 5G to these existing networks you can add all these capabilities and in touch is just one more example of that right you can take a network that maybe was deployed 20 years ago 15 years ago right never intended to actually touch the internet and now you can build in Secure remote access to that Legacy Network that never used to have that capability and again we're not adding new servers we're not adding new software right we're just using the peplinks that's there or putting a pep link there and that's really how the infrastructure needed but it's yeah it's nuts so if you look at the old school out of band management capabilities usually there's some sort of primary ISP a lot of times and I've seen with another another piece of equipment you might even have another cellular platform another bill that you have to pay to plug into their SIM card or to their device to add this out of band management capabilities via cellular but the downside is that's another sim card another antenna and more connectivity and it's not seamless uh between carrier connectivity um so the old school connectivity is you have your ISP your connect DN and then you have to have some sort of VPN and that ISP fails you're then failing over to some sort of backup or in a lot of cases no solution um with InTouch we oh sorry one thing that I love to talk about here is just I think the irony is kind of huge for me is that you know with autoband management really what you're doing is you're building two networks right you've got your network that serves all your users right and so that's got switches and routers and internet connection maybe one maybe two but then all these companies built these out of band management networks which were deployed right next to that user network but the out-of-band management network was only for the administrators to get in there when the user Network broke right and so that out-of-band management network is a fully separate Network it's a whole nother set of routers and things and connections right like you said either SIM cards or physical Wireline circuits but when that main Network fails the out-of-band management network doesn't actually fail over for the users right it's just a back door for the administrators to get in it doesn't actually help the users get back online it doesn't protect them so you're building two networks and you're not really adding any actual redundancy or you're not improving the uptime really other than figuring out what's wrong when it's broken so there's a better way and the better way is uh speed Fusion or sfc uh protect right so taking advantage of our speed Fusion Cloud environment and uh the already existing peplink infrastructure usually with SIM cards uh with all of our modern Technologies um you can now use in control and sfc to in that same bonding pane uh that you're using to to connect for out of band for for resiliency can now be used for out-of-band management and so in touch allows us to uh utilize existing Technologies to establish that resilient connectivity or that that out of band access and so if your primary ISP fails it's going to go right over to your backup or cellular or even sfc LTE and you're going to maintain that that resilient access regardless of the state of your internet connections which means you can access your IP kvms your ippdus uh cameras and things like that seamlessly you need to reboot your cable modem or your carrier connect your carrier uh firewall or whatever you can simply just log in and then you know reset that device uh as if you were sitting on the network now you can invest your money into one network that makes everybody's jobs easier and more productive and yeah well that's the other thing I don't know that's a really good point uh Travis is that you're not buying two systems it's the existing system that you already have deployed and you're just adding out-of-band management to it um funny enough though I've used in touch to access peplink routers that were being blocked by a firewall Upstream so you know in control uses uh 5246 to access to establish that remote web admin and so I had customers with where they had like two sites and on their headquarter site their their Upstream firewall was blocking outbound five two four six so I was using speed Fusion which did have allowed 4 500 inbound I was using speed fusion with in touch going into the uh a remote site that had cellular connectivity to then access the Lan of the remote router so I just put in the IP address of my peplink router my my peplink router on the other side of the tunnel and I was able to actually access the Lan of that device if I was sitting um the local to that Network and so it was really kind of neat to be able to get into a peplink router that that was being blocked by a firewall um and make changes to it so kind of kind of a fun like Tech troubleshooting tool kit there um I I drew this I apologize that's not as fancy as all the other cool marketing drawings this is a tech drawing from an engineer um but the idea is if you know we have a br2 pro 5G actually that would be a br1 but I didn't have a drawing for it so pretend that's a br2 pro 5G um with uh two 5G modems in it or SIM cards connecting to speed Fusion protect here I've got two Cisco switches um Linked UP And I've got a and then you can plug in a USB to rs-232 for console access which is really cool but I also have a camera and a server so on my in touch I can have my USB one programmed for uh rs-232 I can SSH into those two switches I can RDP into a server or I can HTTP into my camera and I'm going to demonstrate this actually uh in real time after the slide here um but the idea is using InTouch and in control I simply just set the protocol and the IP address of what I'm trying to connect to and then using InTouch I can then pull log into those devices via any web browser and what's really nice and I'm I'm a phone geek so I've got I love my phones and I've got like the big screen you know fold phone and I can use in touch and and provide tech support in real time using RDP and web access and it's very convenient to be able to just open up your screen get in without any vpns or any PC with special protocols I simply open up InTouch click the device I want to connect to and I now have access uh so I find that to be very enjoyable um so here we talked is a deployment scenario where we talk about cellular connectivity plus remote site management and so you have your a main site here with a br1 mini it has an IP camera and it's using rs-232 uh for management so we have a an Ethernet line and a cellular line and a firewall but then we use in control for centralized management so the administrator can use https or you know like I just mentioned on InTouch to log right into that device behind the firewall because of in controls outbound going connectivity and you can see like a larger Branch site with two HD Dome 5gs uh bonded cellular connecting in with to phones or rs-232 RDP SSH and telnet sessions and so the idea is in control and in touch brings all of these together to one pane of glass for your knock administrator to be able to access those devices seamlessly a couple verticals this hits uh drives I don't know if you have comments on this one I specialize mostly in the uh the Enterprise and broadcast and Healthcare worlds but it's kind of neat to see the uni like kind of this unified like spread of of the areas because you have iot which is obviously a big key word these days um but you also have Enterprise and connectivity where you might have uh large like large camera networks or phone networks we need to log in and access those devices I find it very useful in my large environments accessing Legacy switches where I'm trying to manage or centralize the management of my entire infrastructure um so that's where I find the most use in this and so I by building this PowerPoint we had a lot of fun looking at really a lot of the possibilities uh I didn't even think about like for example meters and sensors um pulling up uh you know pulling up the web admin page of a of a remote VoIP phone to change the configuration I thought that was a kind of neat idea there um once again the switches and um uh point-of-sale Terminals and stuff like that that I do all the time um as well as servers so but there's a lot of verticals here oh go ahead I think it's pretty Universal right like all of us are trying to build things way outside of our four walls and and it's it's frustrating if you have to reach out to somebody out on that other side because you need somebody who kind of knows what they're doing knows what they're looking for and you got to sit there and work with them on the phone and you're tying two people up right so there's so many different ways that we see customers trying to deal with this kind of like remote distributed distributed Network and you know historically they're buying different systems they're buying you know management software they're bought they're deploying vpns right they're going through all these different things and they're just are frankly sick of it right it's just one more thing they have to maintain so I mean Fleet mobile Enterprise small business it's just all over the place that people need to get into other devices that that are out at these locations and when you can do it yourself from a phone or a computer wherever you are yeah it makes your job easier and makes users jobs a lot easier too because they don't talk to you what's in their job what's interesting is I don't even remember but we had this really interesting talk um Travis at the peplin tech Summit last year and we were talking about in control and empowering the I.T administrator to simplify Network management right to simplify troubleshooting the all the built-in tools and in control that made detecting network issues easier and and more streamlined in it and we talk about handling thousands or tens of thousands of nodes all across the world and uh I I in touch just brings that even further integrated um I have a client that has uh they're they have they're running peplink um sdxs and epxes at all of their headquarters data centers and Branch sites but they're running Cisco switches um throughout the infrastructure um and I have another client that's running Netgear switches throughout their entire infrastructure and with but in both of these scenarios the NETGEAR switch customer and the Cisco switch customer I simply added on the net on The Cisco switches I added a telnet session on the Netgear switches I added an https session but now my devices are not open to the world I can simply use InTouch and I can manage those switches as if I was sitting and managing a peplink switch I mean not not as easy but pretty pretty easily and uh yeah and I I find that to be incredibly powerful uh just making that single access pane for your it support management yeah yeah and the fact that you're not using public IPS to do that you're not port forward and you're not opening holes into your network because you know things like telnet telnet's not really a secure protocol anymore right it hasn't been for a long time and so we can wrap that around wrap the in control security layer around it and yet you're not opening that up to the world you're not putting yourself at risk you're using it in a quiet private space and but yet it's easy to do we have a uh another video here uh [Music] maximize it [Music] oh 8.2 firmware I thought it was eight two one [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] man the interesting thing is you know obviously we have the marketing sides and you have the tech you know the idea is out of band connectivity and this is now being increased with speed Fusion connect um but uh it's an interesting slide though yeah let's dive into your demo though yeah let's dive into the demo I like that idea because I think it'll be more fun okay so in touch requires a few different uh a few things one you have to be running a peplink router running 8.2 firmware um I've got a uh my epx um I use this when I was talking about Synergy mode um so this is running the uh 830 uh rc5 and I've got just cellular connectivity and so you can see this guy here there's nothing no other connections coming in here um I've unhooked my ethernet connection so I unhooked my star links Etc and it's yep yeah there's no public IPS at all so the idea is that we're just connecting via cellular connectivity uh for this purpose of this demo um the next thing is we have to Define what we're connecting so for example I have a assist can you see me okay uh sort of I mean I know this my video might be smaller yeah you're so small but we can see it clear okay I've got a I've got a Cisco switch that I connected here it's not ethernet nothing plugged into the ethernet um just a console cable um with eight three oh we now have the ability to to USB uh uh Star Tech 8 or 16 Port uh rsp32 so I've got two rs-232s one going to my peplink switch and one going to the Cisco switch then I have an IP camera up here that is um funny enough on a completely separate IP subnet so I'll show you how I figured it's on the bottom of the camera it was a one night it's statically assigned 192.168 5.163 and if you look at my screen you'll notice My untagged Lan is 172 16 253 and my management network is 172 16 188 which is neither of those IP addresses and so I'm going to kind of knock out real a really cool uh uh show of uh even better out-of-band management um I love this this little detail Peter because this is such a common scenario especially with IP cameras right they were deployed to not talk to the internet or any Gateway and now we can I just thought I thought that was really neat that I was able to get this online without rebuilding my entire network um so so once you have defined what you want to connect to I have an rs-232 I have an IP now also and if you haven't seen my video on it the epx is a hypervisor so I'm also running a uh let's see if this is I just for fun and since we have uh this running right now so I'm running in Ubuntu uh VM on my PC and that has my virtual machine manager I can actually connect in here I can connect into my um my epx and I've got a Windows uh 2012 Windows Server 2022 VM running other hyper-v or hypervisor KVM hypervisor on this uh epx um and so and I have a whole video on that not the purpose of this call but I can demonstrate RDP um access so you're going to go into the router it's important so here's my my Synergy group you can't configure in touch from the group or the org you have to be in the device that is connected to the device you want to manage so I've got my group I've got my epx my Dome and my switch then I can go into my epx go to settings in touch and if you have a USB rs-232 connected you're going to see it'll actually look like that it'll say serial Port based if you don't see this that means it's not plugged into the USB on the back or the front of the device um so uh so you want to see this then you'll see uh the list of Serial ports and the settings this was originally very misleading to me which is why I wanted to demo it versus watch a video these grayed out these grayed out sections you actually click on the grayed out name and then you have to turn it on and once you turn it on I can say uh USB 1.3 I can set my speed like 9600 881n and oh no okay and now it'll turn blue once it's enabled um so so that's important the other thing is when you click on this I can actually assign a group to this so This switch I could say peplink switches for example hit okay and then for this USB 1.2 I could say switches and then on this USB 1.2 as well I could say uh switch IDF uh second floor or whatever I wanted to do there so I've assigned a group and a name hit okay hit save changes now if I go back to my group level and I scroll down look here's witches Cisco switch IDF second floor taplink switch a and then my ungrouped my server 2022 my PTZ camera and my USB 1.3 so once you configure the in control on the on the device if you have a whole bunch of devices listed here you can then unify those all into different groups so if you have seven or eight peplink routers all of them managing different devices and you give them common group names like switches peplink switches and ungrouped you can now access that like you could have the first floor and the third floor um right here and so that's really really nice in my opinion be able to roll all those in touch devices into a single grouping uh in the group uh dashboard here I think that's really important because like the administrator might not be the one that's actually using this right the administrator's setting it up but it might be some you know lower level technician that's coming in and logging into the phones or the switches and you know organizing it for them is is really useful instead of having to have them figure out which pep link is that switched behind right that's not going to be obvious too in a lot of cases but and that's a really good point under your group settings you can create a user that only has in touch right here you see this InTouch user so I could create a user for a level one admin or my VoIP admin and give them only access to the InTouch devices um so they're not able to log in and mess with any of my peplink routers or switches they can only look at the in-touch devices so you there's a new role that's also been assigned called in touch user that will only give them access to the in in touch devices on this group so once I've once I've done this so This switch is we've already talked about is rs-232 so I've got it plugged in to the console in the back and I've got it plugged into Port 2 on my on my start startech so if I click on this it's going to open up a new web browser and there's a couple things that are really cool about this one this URL up top which normally I don't share but I do for I want to show you this this URL is a bookmarkable so I can click my favorites and say switch IDF second floor and now I have this saved right here so I can now come back to this in my favorites and access this device so now I'm in my switch I can enable the switch I can show run it's going to build the configuration and I have my switch as if it was sitting right there and now I have my switch and the other thing that I love about the the hyperlink the URL Peter is what we just talked about before of being able to give different people access privileges to just in touch and so you know I can create a user that's just an in-touch user and then I can just message them this hyperlink right I can send them an email or just on chat I can just drop them that hyperlink and it's going to take them right to that in control login screen and then it's going to pull this right up for them so it's help user useful for me but you can build really powerful you know kind of dashboards or landing pages for these other users that you might not have managing all these other devices correct yeah a lot of time like I was actually working with a customer or partner I guess on um playing around with eigrp and ospf and I actually added the user as an InTouch user in my in my group then just sent them a link to the out-of-band management and boom I was done that was it so it was super easy for me to quickly deploy uh and get remote support on this switch with another user um I found that to be uh really neat or just think like a third party vendor right maybe you've got a new application that you put on your Windows Server it's just not working right and I can't figure it out and then oh my gosh how am I gonna I gotta set I gotta install TeamViewer on my server like no I can't do that right like I can't open up now open up security ports and things like that so we're in touch so this is my my server 2022 sitting um uh running inside my epx then I'm already peeing it using In Touch without any firewall ports open in the world uh to the to the public so this server is running uh uh completely isolated and secure um there there's no open ports to it uh and so I can log into it and access now I can use this server to access other systems if I wanted to or even one of my customers uses these as read-only domain controllers that's a whole nother topic but I mean I I'm in a web browser and I have my server uh running and that is uh pretty cool in my opinion definitely useful uh and then if I come back in here here's a camera example so this is pulling up an HTTP web page of that camera that's um sitting up there and so you can see it comes in I can then log in go to my configuration I can set up all the settings here I can even manipulate the PTZ portion of it and so it's actually moving right now uh you can't see that but I can um so there are this is a important uh there are some webcam protocols that are not supported yet inside InTouch um so if you get a black screen this is not built for uh all of I guess the different protocols because there's so many different camera protocols um but I use this for configuration on this camera and that's why I want to do this because we do SRT a lot and so I can log in and mess with my enable my SRT and my ethernet settings on this network um and then I mentioned this camera it's kind of interesting this camera is running a static IP address of 192.1685.163. my network I just want to show this because I think it's so cool I just needed to get into this machine so my network is not 192.1685. it is 172.16. so how am I managing a 192.1685 device if I go into my device um remote web admin dashboard so now I'm logged into my peplink router I can go into my network settings and my VLAN and look at this so if I click on VLAN 0 here which is untagged I I was doing another demo um you can click here to configure additional IP addresses or additional IP subnets so all I did is click the question mark enable subnet and added 192.1685.1 to My untagged Lan now I have the my router this interface is using both um IP addresses now I was able to log in now I can log into that router enable DHCP or change it to 172 16 253 or whatever I need to do um I just thought that was cool um we talked about out-of-band management and getting access to the devices I just thought that was a neat troubleshooting step that I went through today to set up this demo um yeah so so many times I feel like we're tasked with just this impossible set of requirements as as many service providers and network Engineers right you need to come in and you need to make my network better it can never go down and all this and oh by the way you can't change anything that's there right you can't change IP addresses or anything and so that's what these tools are there for right you can actually live with those requirements and and still deliver you know the solution that customers are looking for and this is just one more example of that um so do you want to look do we want to try to answer some questions yeah I think that's a great idea um so uh would there be any way to do uh SCP FTP type currently we're not doing file transfers through uh technically you could pull up like a web FTP like you know like a little like a file like a a web-based interface but but FTP is currently not supported um the currently supported protocols as of the making of this video is so if I go into my epx and go back to InTouch IP based ad so I have HTTP https SSH telnet RDP and VNC um so those are the currently supported IP protocols that are that are supported inside and touch yeah and I think you know that question really gets down to the the VPN side of it right you know InTouch is an alternative way to a VPN to reach a lot of these protocols but a VPN would be an alternative way to securely and privately use one of those protocols like FTP where you're doing more than just you know clicking in a web browser right where you actually need that protocol to spit out on the other side that same way that would be to me that's more of an application of speed fusion um but it's still a super valid question because sometimes that's that's hard to do right and so one of the things related to that though is uh we we in in our corporate environment we actually use InTouch to access admin Center uh so that we're securing access to our servers via just just in touch um and then we configure our FTP you know in is and things like that but um you know uh but but no we we don't at the file transfer um another question was are um what type of connectivity is it serial or IP both uh so we support serial based connectivity and IP based connectivity uh that was earlier in the the the demo so yeah that's an important Point too is that that's a big that's a big reason why we're talking today is 8.3 adds this serial capability exactly in touch has been here for a little while but now we're opening this up so there's these third-party USB adapters that you can plug into a peplink router with a USB port and then they've got multiple serial ports on them and so you can connect to a whole bunch of different serial devices behind any any existing pep link that's got a USB port so uh somebody asked if we can use InTouch to to access the web interface of the in the Sim injector yes um yes you can uh that is also a better of money um and it's a very fair question and I use in touch to access the web admin of several peplink devices in different scenarios um and uh and it is that's a very fair question and um it's an unfortunate one but there is reasoning behind that the Sim injectors uh processor and things like that the way that it's designed but um uh in touch will allow access to uh the Symmetry anything with a web browser so once again you can just do HTTP or https and log in um I've even used some in touch to access devices on the WAN of a peplink router so like say I have a dome that's not connecting now we can use Synergy and that's it's irrelevant but if you had a dome that's not connecting I can actually use InTouch to log in on the WAN so um InTouch is definitely something that we can use to access the SIM injector Mini uh access to remote equipment for Command Center so I heard another interesting idea the other day from a customer and I love this because it's there's just lots of ways people can use this sometimes we have customers that wind up in a different scenario where there isn't a peplink router on site but maybe they've came in as a service provider and they've added a peplink switch or a peplink access point and so those are all examples of times where you can use and touch as well you don't actually need the peplink router you can use that switch to be your kind of in-touch Gateway and have these same capabilities even if you as the service provider don't have a a router on site so again it just gives you more flexibility and capabilities as you jump into these different these different scenarios with your customers exactly um the Star Tech I'm using is a uh is the industrial Star Tech um I just bought an Amazon so if you go to Amazon and search Star Tech or a USB to rs232 Industrial they make it eight port and a 16 Port version um both of those uh note they work there is a specific set of chipset required for the USB to rs-232 and is there a knowledge based article on that um I I think it's mentioned in the release notes of 830 I'm just taking it I know there's a specific uh not every USB to rs2 will 32 232 will work it's a specific chipset but but for the purpose of this video uh the star Star Tech and Industrial eight port and 16 Port do work um and confirmed yeah it's fttdi is the name of the chipset but I'm digging for the more specific link to give people that um we got a question we'll be supporting iprs232 uh Gateway um that I don't know we could definitely do a feature request um on that one um but it's not supported yet I think that's a good time to just bring this up this little blue flag in the right corner or in the right side oh yeah that is the screen yeah this thing does something by the way yeah like right here this is good in control there's a feedback option uh you can just click that and it's going to take a little screenshot of your uh your of your of your page here and you could literally just say can we add iprs 232 uh to InTouch hit send feedback give it a justification and just so you know if that's something multiple people on this webinar want to do if you submit it you'll flood Michael and he might be mad at me for saying to do this uh but that you'll see the demand for the need um but currently it's not supported and likewise if you're having Pro like down here you know like we talk about IP cameras or things like that like there are thousands of devices you can use in touch with and so we just don't know every device is going to be 100 compatible so when you run into those problems that tool is the fastest way to get that fixed it's not a dead end I've never seen an InTouch device where a customer said oh this didn't work and then a week later we didn't have it working so I'm not promising every device will work but it's again so far we've not found devices that we can't make that work better with right so and that button on that yeah and on that as well I was setting up even my my PTZ camera here and there was something in the JavaScript that wasn't allowing me to log in I just hit the click the feedback said can't log in and I would say less than less than 24 hours later that they had already fixed it and this is a brand new setup and it worked when I moved it so it wasn't specific it was a they fixed whatever that wasn't in touch um two really good questions uh what what well uh is there more is there one that has more than one support yes this is an eight serial Port rs-232 so yes but then another really good question what do your in-touch specific outbound policy rules look like and that's important I don't have in touch this is using speed Fusion connect and it's not using outbound policy rules so if I pull up my my router and I go to my advanced settings here and outbound policy that's none none so I'm I'm running on Auto in touch natively uses speed Fusion connect to establish the tunnel and and so I'm not running any special outbound policies I'm simply just turned on the feature and if you get an error that says you're out you've exceeded your sfc quota it's because you no longer have either a valid uh essential care subscription um or you've used up your quota um on the on your sfc like you know it comes with a certain number of gigabytes so you just need to purchase but it uses uh speed Fusion connect uh natively um so there are no policies good job Andrew Andre um so I think that's most of the questions um that I can't answer via I just answered one and I think somebody else has already kind of answered that too about you know using the rs230 port 232 port to kind of like feed out to another device and that's that's kind of different than what we're talking about here this is just for you know user console access so you can interact with a text interface on the other side send commands receive feedback if you're using something more live like a Telemetry application where you need to take sensor data from here and receive it over there that's uart functionality it's using a Serial Port but in a different purpose correct and in which case you'd want to use speed fusion and then connect via IP to that or something and that's that's important like I have this is enabled this this uh epx is connected via um I've got my land smoothing but I also have my I have a connection right here back to my office and so I've got speed Fusion connect uh enabled but I also have IP uh I have sorry my brain um I have uh access via IP via speed Fusion so if I pull up OBS for example it's kind of a neat use case for remote connectivity so now you don't have to pretend that I have two people here um but I I'm only one so if I have my camera set up here so there's my there's my camera streaming I can then pull up in touch like uh Travis could pull up in touch log into this device remotely and then move the camera and then it's going to move the camera here so you're going to have the camera feed will can be moved you can see my big massive uh so if I do that and aim it at me and it's you should see me in a second here when it pulls up um so there you go and so you can have one person controlling the camera and another person viewing it or streaming via speed Fusion so that's different you're not going to stream speed Fusion our stream SRT traffic over in touch um and that kind of goes into the same concept of the uh of the rs-232 InTouch is used for out-of-band management um uh more so than than live communications if that makes sense yeah and I love that Peter because like remote production is is such a huge Trend in you know the video and broadcast industry but it's that same concept in any industry almost right it's I need somebody with a certain skill set over here to help me over in some totally different place and so this is just that glue to make that pretty much brainless for those people to to jump in and help exactly um and and InTouch is supported on almost every I don't believe there's any products that don't support InTouch um our bonding routers obviously are the the kind of the coolest routers for it because you get to take take advantage of speed Fusion connect um like the ubr plus the br2 pro 5G I mean if everyone wants to buy an epx I I would be more than happy to sell you epxs for that as well um so no issues there um but the uh so here's my lab environment that I've set up um right here that you guys were looking at and um is there any other any other questions we might actually finish this this topic early I'm just looking through and I don't see any other yes that will work that's the industrial one so you can see I've already purchased this previously um yeah and they have the eight the eight port and the 16 Port industrial ones and the two points you can see that ftdi mention up there in the title there that's the name of the chipset that is needed oh there you go USB to DB9 so but yes this is the one that I purchase often you can see there you go I've purchased it right there so um and that's the one that that works well yep I've got that one I think the other one that I'll throw out there just as food for thought is you know as as this gets bigger and people start thinking more about what they can do with this I think the API side is another layer that we haven't really dug into yet but being able to actually programmatically build these and and extend these types of connections out to other users again I think as you look bigger into more sophisticated ways to do this that's very much something that could be possible as well so you know again that's just more curiosity from my side but I think over and over again our users have proven that there's tons of creativity out there and how people use these tools and so we'll just kind of hang that out there and see what ideas people come up with on that and I will add too that uh in our in our data center we actually use in touch to access our our management backplane of all of our servers so most servers or um Enterprise computers have a you know an eye Drac or some very you know some form of Ip KVM almost built right into the uh the server or the motherboard um we actually just plugged these into our management VLAN and then we use InTouch now so instead of opening those up via VPN we actually now block the port access to that platform and then we use InTouch um to do that so increasing our security layer and we now have um uh VLAN uh intervene routing turned off and disabled port forwarding uh so basically in order to access the idrac of our of our servers we have to use InTouch now and so we find that to be incredibly uh more reliable but also we can remotely reboot the servers we can install operating systems on them and everything right via InTouch and so kind of a neat feature there yeah I heard I heard a customer of ours use a term that I really love because it just boils it all down right and they call it remote rack right that's kind of what InTouch is enabling it's enabling that remote rack so they can just reach out and deal with any device in that rack that doesn't matter where it is right that's that's the solution that InTouch is enabling is that remote access to whatever stack of devices is wherever wherever those are and somebody asked that it's not available to the device connector I don't believe so because you can't use the APS and stuff and the device connector is an AP firmware so um it would have to be a speed Fusion connect enabled device um because we use speed Fusion connect for that so that's a really good question um APS in router mode um device connectors things like that that don't have if there has to be a speed Fusion connect enabled device uh for in touch to work again those are things that I think are possible though I mean this is all the glue's all there right we just got to kind of put it all together so if there's if there's a use case where that's needed um let us know because again we've got a lot of tools in the toolbox but we just need to see what people are really trying to do or what problems people are trying to solve exactly anyways uh I think we can end a few minutes early we've answered almost all the questions if we haven't answered your question um it might be because I I didn't feel like it was appropriate for the topic um please you can feel free to email Travis or myself um and we're more than happy to answer those questions there's a couple questions about purchasing and things like that your question is visible I just feel like it's not appropriate to talk talk about in an open form like this um so please feel free to reach out um uh Peter westnetworks.com uh Travis if you want to say your email address uh you can and I'm just Travis peplink.com Travis peplink.com and so Peter westnetworks.com Travis at peplink.com and we'd be more than happy to answer those questions for you um uh further if you have additional questions um but otherwise I thank you so much for attending and uh I look forward to seeing most of you next uh next month when we do our next presentation uh and showing off more Technologies thanks so much folks take care have a good one"}

Bob and his ice cream store. Like many ice cream store owners, Bob has his point of sale app and he has a guest WiFi so that people can get on the Internet. But every once in a while, the Internet will go down and his guests lose the Internet. His point of sale loses connectivity. He can't process credit card payments and his staff loses the ability to get online, all because the Internet goes out. Could be a rainstorm, could be somebody knocked over the router, could be an electrical outage down the street, whatever. But the Internet goes out and now Bob's ice cream stores shut down. And then they'll come back online and they'll be back connected again. But those transactions all got interrupted and then they'll go down again and then up again and then down again. Have you ever had that happen? Super frustrating. So Bob called Peplink and said: “Help, I need reliable connectivity.” and Peplink sent him a Balance 20X. The Balance 20X has built in SpeedFusion Connect LTE and SpeedFusion Connect Protect bonded internet service. What this means is Bob's point of sale application now can use his cable Internet and backup cellular Internet for his cloud applications while allowing his guests Internet to still use regular cable Internet. If his cable Internet goes out, his business applications don't fail at all because they just seamlessly roll over to the LTE backup. If he wanted to, he could allow even his guest network to fail over to that LTE network to keep his guests online. And then when the cable modem comes back online, all the traffic seamlessly falls over to the cable Internet. This means that he never loses connectivity, even if he has a cable Internet failure. What's really cool about the Balance 20X and SpeedFusion Connect LTE is that SpeedFusion Connect LTE costs nothing per month. This means you're not spending a whole bunch of money for a backup solution that you might not use. Instead, you can just load up gigabytes and use those gigabytes as needed during random outages. so you can have a 30 second outage and go back online. You have a 3 hour outage and go back online. And no matter what that outage length is, you're just using the SpeedFusion Connect LTE to keep your business up and running. So be like Bob and get a Balance 20X."}

I honestly did I I was like there's so many improvements coming in this in this firmware that I'm like I can't even I'm like Blown Away by what might come in the next major release you know um absolutely yeah and that's that's the fun part about what we get to do is we get to show people all this great stuff so that's what we're going to do today we're going to dive in and show you all this powerful functionality and I think there's a lot for a lot of people that a lot of people enjoy here especially in 5G starlink customers there's lots yeah there's a lot and I'm running my my Sprinter um and I've got I installed my starlink on it um now I am facing a building so I'm getting obstructions um but I do I do have my starlink set up so it'll be fun to Showcase that today as well um and then the other thing is instead of just a feature uh Travis I want to do this a little different I want to talk about these features and then and explain why we have these features and what the difference is between like vwan and and Synergy mode and some of these amazing new technologies are coming out and why you might use them and so I've got I've got two different routers set up I've got my router and my Sprinter and then I've got my my router in my lab and um and and we're going to use both of those and I've got Vizio where we're going to Showcase Sonic kind of some topology answering questions and so hopefully this is going to be educational about these new features but also showing you how to implement these new features as well yeah and I I love that the Vizio that that's classroom again right like let's let's connect the dots and show how this actually works and what you can do with it and why you're going to do that so absolutely wow excellent so let's dig in um 8.3 is is currently an rc3 right now it's so it's um it's in the uh it's it's release candidate um I believe there's gonna be an rc4 um if I'm allowed to say that out loud which I just did so it doesn't matter uh and then we're going to try to go to GA so um so this is a beta uh so if you I don't recommend using this in a uh Mission critical business environment but if you're if your kind of person likes to play and wants to to play around with that software um that's great but otherwise think of this as just getting you excited about what's coming uh more so than go out and download this today uh if that makes sense yep and you know I'm I'm that type of person and I know where that risk and you know line is and you know I'm running that firmware now on this webinar right I mean this is our dog food so we eat it you know and you know I'm not saying again like you said go put this in your production environment because that's your decision not mine but yeah I got to make sure it works before somebody else finds out if it doesn't so exactly um one of the things I forgot to put in the slides Travis I do want to highlight before we go into the slides is if you are familiar with the bat the balance and the the max interfaces the guise uh you're gonna know something notice something up here in the top so he this is a peplink balance router dashboard sfc Network Advanced AP system status and then if I go into my Max router dashboard they have now unified the language of network and advanced I forgot to put that in the slides and I was noticing that while I was playing around with my lab today and I just wanted to highlight it real fast that uh they've unified the UI additionally if you've ever used a Max router and you know you have these drag and drop priorities well now in the balance routers you have that functionality now so this is the balance this is an epx and I now have the ability to drag and drop my priorities now I and once again I do apologize I forgot to put those in the slide and I just wanted to quickly highlight that before we get started they've unified space and and I and I'm very pleased about that now now it's even more uh uh uniform right between the ecosystem is now more merged between the maps and the balance Series yeah and you know I love that you brought that up because that really tells a story about you know everything about where we are now because you know that's how peplink started right we started out with Wireline and we were doing bonding you know 10 15 years ago with wire line circuits and that was cool and that was relevant in the Wireline world but then cellular became a thing and so that was the pep wave brand so pep link was the wired and pep wave was the wireless and you know with 5G and starlink and that differentiation is just not relevant anymore right businesses use it all and so everybody uses it all it's not just businesses either right and so that's not useful in the products interface either right there's no reason to differentiate those two and so we're very much trying to undo those things and because it's it's they're doing the same things right they might have different ports or different interfaces but we're solving connectivity problems we're making that work better and that's the message now and so we're trying to deliver that in a unified way in the GUI as well and so that's kind of the back story on on why that all changed and why that was the way it was but very much happy to see that unified like you like you said Peter yeah it's it's very nice so let's talk about some technical improvements as well now coming in so um so in the 5G uh uh in the 5D World peplinks added a two antenna mode um this is really important for those of that might be interested in going from a an hd4 mbx cap 12 to an hd4 mbx 5G and not wanting to install two new antennas so 5G or cat 18 starting with cat 18 pebbling went to 4x4 memo which means there's four antenna connections uh per cellular modem so if you have an hd4 mbx cat 18 you have 16 antenna cables on the back of that that beast and then if you have a mbx an mbx ltea cat 12 it's got eight antenna connections um and then the uh the category 20 or the 5G is running uh 16 it's 4x4 memo so so peplink has made the ability now where uh if you go into the 5G modem you can now choose either two antenna mode or for antenna mode and that'll allow you to use your existing uh Mobility antennas to take advantage of 5G now you will lose two of your antennas so you might you lose a little bit of performance and or uh signal capabilities or band capabilities but you're not going to be just sending data out to antennas that are not connected it'll actually turn those off um yeah I think the upgrade thing that you mentioned is I think such a big deal and what whether you've got a peplink router today or not anybody that's looking to upgrade an existing cellular deployment to 5G this often gets overlooked that oh shoot I need a whole new antenna now because I've only got two and I need four and you know it's not just a peplink thing 5G the standard is to have four antennas and you know those technical reasons for it but with two antenna mode you don't have to now right and you're going to sacrifice a little bit of performance but in most circumstances it's going to far outweigh the benefits of you know your performance benefits are going to far outweigh that that little knock on the two versus four so just opens it up to make make it way easier to deploy 5G exactly the um this feature uh this two antenna mode is only available on the GH devices correct am I saying that quickly Travis correct okay uh there are models of of our routers so like the GD uh the like the the cat 18 is the G LTE the the original 5G was the GD um and then the newer uh and I'm uh on a different chipset uh they're GH and those are the ones that are going to be have this functionality right so the model does matter yeah yeah and so the 5gh is basically the default SKU for the US market and that's there's certification reasons more so than technical reasons why there's oh okay there we go so yeah that that but nonetheless this is a technical difference between those two skus that 5gh SKU has the two antenna mode the 5gd would not and if you have been playing around with peplink routers for a while especially the 5G you'll notice that the cellular settings on the 5G routers was horribly missing uh some some of the features um you can now see that all of these features have been added back in so we have our signal strength our bandwidth allowance we have um the carrier selection capability now where we can customize and empty a PLM encode um or manually select a carrier um so you can we now have the ability to have carrier selection as well as signal threshold uh let's see signal adjuster monitor bandwidth Channel whiffs and even SIM card priorities and SIM card priorities is is really cool um so if you look here up at the top I've got SIM card sim a Sim B and then remote Sim one of the biggest problems with the remote Sim or the Sim injector was well what if you're trying to connect um in that Sim ejector isn't there you can fail over to like a pepsim or a backup SIM card um on your on your slots and then prioritize your your those different options so I think that's a that's a phenomenally powerful uh capability that's been added to the uh the cellular settings uh routers yep I mean more and more customers are using more Sims and so being able to manage those intelligently and automatically so you don't get yourself in an overage situation or you know missing a carrier when you need the performance exactly um Dynamic weighted bonding um there's an entire white paper on Dynamic weighted bonding on um on the peplink Forum and if you want to go into the technical details about this I highly recommend if you're if you're one of these people that really wants to understand uh what Steve did in this um I highly advise reading that that article but for the for the purpose of this webinar Dynamic weighted bonding is is has been a dramatic change in cellular bonding performance or handling of of what we might want to call like variant or or very like differential internet connections right where you have it's not you're not bonding to 5G or five uh gigabit fiber lines you're bonding variable internet connections that might have some throughput then go away like cellular or satellite and dynamic weighted bonding handles those variant the variables much much better by dynamically enabling uh Wan smoothing or uh uh based on pack loss or handling packet loss as a means of congestion detection um and so that with 8.3 firmware Dynamic weighted bonding is Now the default bonding profile for any new tunnels created so prior to 8.3 when you created a new profile you would get bonding as the option and you'd actually have to manually go and enable Dynamic weighted bonding um now with 8.3 firmware Dynamic weighted bonding has been through the paces it's been tested um we've been using this I believe since 8.2.0 uh and I die that might be wrong but I believe that's accurate um and so it's it's been through the testing and we believe that Dynamic weighted bonding is uh should be the default uh bonding Pro uh policy at least uh Travis any any additional on that or is that a does that seem about right absolutely I mean I think the big story again it kind of comes back to that whole you know the gooey merging right the wired and the wire line worlds have merged and the links and the connections in those two different worlds behave dramatically different and so there's products out there in the sd-wan and Enterprise space that do bonding and some of those things but they're they target the wire line only because that's the biggest business uh market right that they've all got the dedicated guaranteed circuits that behave very well day to day most of the time and so nobody has these algorithms that are really optimized to put both of those things together right we've got these like cellular networks that are just ad hoc right we just don't know what we're going to get out of them any minute or second of the day and putting that together with a very reliable link doesn't always work that well and so Dynamic weighted bonding deals with those variations and combines them in a much more intelligent way than we've ever been able to do before and so you know the the possibilities are growing and growing and so we're making the algorithm more and more intelligent to deal with all those different different options that are out there so that you don't have to think about it and fine-tune things it's just going to work much better and protect what you're protecting it's interesting because where I'm at right now I actually pulled up to do a job and um there's a big big building right that way um uh and it might when I was doing my drive when I was driving up here and I pulled in to get some coffee earlier I was doing some speed tests and I was getting well over 100 megabits of bonded throughput on my my Sprinter here and when I got here I'm only getting about 20 Megs but but more importantly what was really interesting about that it's not the throughput it's the fact that one of my carriers is only getting about 300 kilobits prior to Dynamic weighted bonding all of my connections would be getting under a Meg I'd only be getting three or four Megs of throughput yeah because that 300 kilobits of capacity on the one carrier would throttle all the others in traditional bonding but with Dynamic weighted bonding the pampling just says okay that one's 300 kilobits but this one's 20 20 megabits and so it lets me continue to utilize that 20 megabit circuit even though one of my circuits is 300 kilobits and so my bonding isn't damaged by underperforming circuits and and that is that's a big deal when you talk about cellular bandwidth and bonding and and dealing with throttling issues or congestion issues and that is single-handedly is one of the most powerful features of dynamic weighted bonding is that ability to detect that and understand that okay I'm going to use that differently than a traditional bonding profile might use it yeah for people that are new to peplink all you need to know is you don't have to do anything right you just set up your your connection and you've got Dynamic weighted bonding turned on and you can throw the links you've got at it for the most part I mean there's going to be some times where you need some you know more refined strategies on that but you know if you're not new to peplink you don't have to do a lot of the things that you used to have to do to make these things as well you know we used to go in there and set like okay maximum latencies for each link and you know if this link gets this far away latency Wise from that you know used to set a lot of different parameters to try and react to these things automatically in a good way but you don't know you just don't have to it's it's incredible how simple it's gotten to deal with really one of the most complicated things we've ever seen you know putting all these links together and and the neat thing is it's all math you know it would be so easy to say this is like AI but it's it's mathematical equations that are analyzing this data in real time and I think that's just so cool because you know it's it's a it's a it's an equation that's that's being monitored inside the speed Fusion tunnel so we think our VPN is just connecting us but it's actually creating a lot of data Insight that allows us to make these choices um and and to me that's awesome yep speed Fusion knows exactly who's performing and who's not every second every millisecond and and it it you know it'll send as much mail as you can handle basically to each connection out there and it does a really good job of basically finding where that breaking point is for each link and reacting to that as that changes too because that's the thing is these links the breaking point changes constantly again hence the Dynamics so yep the math has to keep changing too and respond so Synergy mode I I don't know if any of you follow me on LinkedIn but probably every other week I'm doing a deployment of an sdx with a number of HD1 domes and those domes I are Wayans for me and I I use an S an HD an sdx or an epx um to to create those connections and I'm managing tons of connections and it's very complicated for the end user to see this and Synergy mode has got me ridiculously excited and if you saw my epx a few minutes ago when I was showing off the the GUI unification you kind of got to see a little bit of synergy mode Synergy mode takes the wands of an upstream peplink router and makes it the WAN of the Synergy mode host and and it's it's like this magical awesome mix of just cool technology and so so I kind of have a little Vizio here so I have an sdx now in my demo on in control I'm gonna have an epx but I thought the sdx pro looked cool so I have this one here and then you have a Transit duo with Synergy mode enabled and so this the Synergy the transit Duo is going to plug in the land of the Synergy of the uh of the of the transit Duo into a Wan enabled port on the on the epx or sdx Pro so you're an enable Wan on this port and then you're going to enable Synergy mode on that Wan and then you'll plug in your Transit Duo and then the same thing will apply for like an HD1 Dome and the reason why I'm doing an HD1 dome in a Transit Duo is because it showcases two very unique scenarios an HD1 Dome will have just a white a wire a 5G connection or if you have the new HD1 Dome Pro you might have a 5G and a Wi-Fi um but for me it's just a it's just a 5G the transit Duo oh I'm sorry this is actually 4G I apologize made this really quick the transit has two 4G modems a Wayne a wired Wan and Wi-Fi Wan and so an sdx has no Wireless in it it has no Cellular in it unless you have the cellular module so in this scenario this epx or sdx Pro is simply ethernet ports however when I enable Synergy mode on this device my my Synergy mode connected devices so my Transit Pro Duo my HD1 Dome 5G and my br1 mini show up as like Flex modules on my on my epx and you can see here's my ethernet Wan my 4x4 memo uh I'm sorry my this is the transit Pro so my Wi-Fi my uh well they're labeled wrong but my cellular my cellular my Wi-Fi and my Wi-Fi then the hd21 Dome has cellular and then the br1 mini has ethernet Wan cellular Wan uh Wi-Fi went on 2.4 gigahertz and Wi-Fi went on five gigahertz all of these lands get added to my my epx as if they were they were physical lands you can see connected to T-Mobile connected to at T if I scroll down here's my ethernet Transit Pro Wan one my br1 Wan one um and then somewhere I have my Cellular Connections and I apologize there's so many there here's all my Wi-Fi wans that are all being brought in from these different devices um and and so I can actually click on that and actually see if there's Wi-Fi networks available as if it was as if this epx had those connections um and so it brings the management and support of these devices directly to the UI of the host um and then one last comment on it real fast to enable this you're going to go to the network tab Wan and then I can scroll all the way down to the bottom and you've got Synergy controller if I click this edit box I can tell it which ethernet ports I want to turn Synergy mode on Synergy mode will not work in combination with v Wan so so we're going to talk about vwan in a minute but it's important these are this is basically creating a a GRE tunnel between the host uh device and the uh Synergy devices uh using a Jerry tunnel and then pulling those interfaces in so you should not you should not manage those devices um via in control or via um directly so to turn this on the first thing you're going to do is you're going to take your epx and your or your sdx or your whatever it is that has Synergy mode and you're gonna enable Synergy mode on an Ethernet Wan then you're going to factory default factory reset whatever device you have plugged into it um and then what's going to happen is when that thing boots up on the Lan if it's running 8.3 firmware it'll then detect that it's a Synergy mode port on the host and then turn into Synergy mode so it's a factory default 8.3 peer device that is being synergized into the host um and so it's a little bit of a like a little bit of a weirdity but once you have it set up it's it's really reliable and and clean um and so I was able to do two of these devices remotely um after I got after I figured out the how to make it work the biggest mistake I made when I was trying to make it work was in in control I had all my all my synergized devices listed because I mean it's in control and so you want to manage all your devices so what I did is I created a new group called synergize devices put those here and then turned on um enabled under in control you see configuration lock is enabled so I have configuration lock so in control is reporting these devices but they're not being managed by in control and control is not pushing any configurations to these devices so the The Host device router is is is managing these devices but this allows us to push firmware check their health of the devices I can see my cellular wands that are connected um to these devices and so so this I created a different group called synergize devices blocked uh configuration updates factory reset them plug them into the ethernet port and now I have that and I wanted to show this because I think sometimes it's like and I don't know Travis you get on these webinars and it's like oh we have this really cool feature and it's like okay well how did you make that work because I've you know I wanted this to to show you it's complicated but I really wanted to spend a few minutes showing you what I had to do to make it work yeah and how you actually put it into action right you know and yeah this that that part might change depending on who you are right if you're uh if you're a managed service provider and you've got you know 50 customers and a thousand locations you're going to approach this very differently than you might if you're an rver and you've got you know a br1 mini and now you upgraded to a br1 pro 5G but nonetheless this feature works great for both of you right and so there's there's ways to actually put that into play for for each of those use cases but it's a great feature for both of them too it is I Synergy mode is really neat um and so so I kind of like outlined this but I I just wanted to highlight that capability um and make sure and this is this is my lab epx um so you can say I've got my my sim injector module um and then I've got my devices and so I believe I believe this one is our Sim give me one second I believe my Transit Pro is there we go so I name right here you have those the options here um I don't know if you want to talk about this at all but that's pretty cool um our Sim is enabled I got it as Priority One and then I've got the serial number of my my sim injector and the epx and then I told it to use port 3 right there and it simply sees it I mean this is actually the GUI of another router but it's happening inside my epx I don't have to log into that router and make any configuration changes set in the IP addresses all the IP addresses of the cellular interfaces are coming right to me so if there's a public static IP assigned to these interfaces they're coming right in um and so you it's it's it's really convenient for management yeah it there's been people putting pebbling products together for years right and it's it's great because you know we've got a lot of different products to serve different use cases but sometimes when you can put the Legos together you can build some really cool stuff and you know it's not just because it's cool right it's because it's useful and it solves problems and waves better than other things they're able to do and so this just makes it so much easier to actually change the game and deploy things in that way and so you know just like you do with all these you know mobile command Vehicles mobile broadcast Vehicles you're putting different things together that didn't start out as a total solution but you know with some Ingenuity and now some some help on the GUI it is a total solution and it makes sense from from everybody inside then and the customer logging in and looking at it and now they see oh I've got 12 cellular modems like they don't care that it's an HD one Dome on the roof of the vehicle they care that I they can see that they're connected to ATT and T-Mobile and their signal strength all those features come right into the the single interface the synergized interface uh in the uh the epx and so it's very nice I think you know you showed the in control screen and I think you know those of those of you out there that haven't really tried to do this before Synergy mode don't really appreciate what that looked like and so before you'd have like let's say we have one bus right it's a mobile medical bus it's a really important vehicle and so Peter's got eight domes eight five G connections on top of that so it as fast as can be and reliable as can be always right well before you would have in a group you'd have okay I've got my router that's inside the bus maybe I've got an sdx Pro and then I've got these eight domes those are all in this group you know so every single device was in here and it showed each of its individual connections there and then you had to do some configuration and it was just a mess right it worked well you had it and then you had to tag them so hey this is in bus one this is in bus two this is in bus three uh so it it made it really complicated for for customers to log in and actually see what was going on and you can see this right here here's my v-man HD1 Dome and that's how I used to do it here's this H1 Dome here's the IP address it and then and then a lot of times I'd say this is on ethernet 1-7 you know on epx 16. and so like you're labeling these domes to match with the the corresponding epx or sdx Pro or whatever it is and it gets it got really challenging on the when you're running you know 14 or 15 mobile units yeah so we had to level up and make it easier for people and it's fun to see how it worked out Center Synergy mode does that this is it is crazy but uh caveat like just from a technical side point but the the synergized device needs to have in go into an in control group or just go to the device and disable um uh in control configuration factory reset it enable Synergy mode on the WAN tab uh and and enable that ethernet port uh it does not work on vwan uh capabilities it's a it's a physical ethernet port to a physical um synergized device so just wanted to highlight those steps just to make sure anybody wants to try to try to set try this at home yeah and I just want to plug the upgrade path to there because you know it's fun to be able to combine things and build cool things but it's also fun when you're just you know an average person to save some money and get something out of the thing that is kind of maybe older and needing to be replaced right if you've got an old slow br1 mini or or something like that you can upgrade to the br1 pro 5G and now you can synergize that old device and now you've got two modems right you're gonna use your phone in my epx I've got a br1 mini do you have 4G you know cat4 whatever it is in there it's you know it is so nice or you take a 20x and just synergize right into that so yeah so yeah it's it's fun because again these these features are powerful for Enterprises and individuals at the same time and it's cool to see that so uh 8.3 has a ton of functional improvements and uh and so we're gonna start going through those a little bit just to highlight some really cool functionality um one the max adapter is has sort of been like this weird almost like almost like Synergy mode it's been this weird USB modem that didn't have its place because when you plugged into a router there were no configuration options for it it was just sort of like connected and you didn't really know why or how um so now if I go to my uh my mbx hd45g um I've got my starter link I've got my four cellular modems and then if you look right here instead of a USB icon it's now converted to a cellular icon and it gets treated just like a cellular modem so when I click on it I get all the cellular modem settings so a Max adapter when you plug it into that USB port on your Mo on your device it is just becoming another cellular device uh Wan um so whether you're taking an old 380 and adding a Max adapter so you can have a 385 G or you're taking an hd4 mbx and adding two Max adapters so you have an hd6 um or 20x and adding a Max adapter for for another 5G modem the ability to just have that as treated as a cellular Wan is really important and and it's it's very powerful for once again configuration Simplicity and having that unified infrastructure throughout the deployment a virtual win I did an entire webinar in Virtual win already uh we did this with the 20x that was actually my last um webinar uh the or the very first webinar the previous one uh in December um but let's I wanted to tell to increase this conversation a little bit and I wanted to whiteboard this in Vizio because virtual Wan is I think more powerful than people might understand and I wanted to if you don't mind Travis I'd like to spend just a few minutes on it I know we're at 12 40. so I'm gonna be respectful of people's time um so I've got my my little lab here and and I have an sdx Pro this could be a 20x this could be a 380 um but I love the sdx pro so I'm gonna have an sdx Pro here then I have a switch and I have two domes and so these two domes are going to give us our 5G cellular connectivity and you might be in a building where your your data center or your IDF or MDF is sitting really far away from a your anywhere near being outside so I can run a fiber line and get a little connector from the five reports on these two two devices and then I can plug in the this don't these two domes to the switch and all I have to do is trunk a VLAN so I could create VLAN 1101 and 1102 and then trunk that down to my my sdx Pro and have these on the Lan or on the Lan and there's two variant two uh two reasons for this when if I do when this port becomes a Wan Port the router treats it like a Wan port and it's looking for 1101 and 1102 on the Wan this is actually really important let's say if we're doing h a and I've got two of these routers uh paired together um and I've got two of these routers where maybe they're they're in ha right and they're talking to this router to this to this Upstream switch in ha wans are treated differently than lands and so if this switch were to go down it would treat it as the WAN failure so in ha if I'm going If This Were lands and this was going down into a core switch stack then and these are lands it will if even if the core switch stock were to fail the ha is going to use the Lan of this and not detect that failure of the downstream connection and so so there's reasons why they're they're there and the reasons why peplink has these configurations available and so so it's important once again I mentioned this in previous uh webinars but it's important to draw and understand the impact of any design um what's important with vwan is is this the capabilities of the deployment so one we could have vwan as Wan meaning I can I can create three vlans uh 1101 1102 let's say two because I have two domes here and then I can set this as a Wan port and then trunk that up and I do that in my epx let me show you that on my epx so on my epx what's that tab oh there it is so on the epx I have this Dome um and you can see it's sfp13 V Wan 1101 and so what I have is a virtual interface so here's my vlans as wans and I've programmed it I'll show you this programming here I've programmed it on 1101 on a specific interface you see vwan Uplink to switch a port 49 and I just label that so I know where it's going but you can choose a physical interface when you choose a physical interface it it converts that interface into a Wan port and then we'll look on that Wan port for 1101 that Wan switch for 1101. if you think about like a 20x it has that one-wan Port you could have a 20x with a switch like an eight Port switch and have eight lands connected well five because it can only have five but five five lands connected to that and then that going down into the 20x or I can choose as Lan which I did in my previous demo with the 20x when I choose it as a lan it will actually allow me let me let me turn this on real fast let me go to vwan 13 here and I'll show you what that looks like so if I if I go and I enable and I say as a lan and I go and say I'll say 1301 and I hit save and apply I can then go to my port settings just like I did in my 20x demo video click on any Lan port go to access and look there's my revert my Reserve VLAN 1301 my V wands the ones that are configured that Wan interface aren't there those are those are going out on a Wan interface that are different so I can set this port to an access on this 1301 as a lan or I can simply push it to the Lan and then trunk that to a switch and it could be any switch architecture I mean we love peplink but it could be any existing switch architecture and it's simply going to look on that Lan for 1301 and then connect to wherever ask for an IP address um so this allows you to scale your infrastructure dynamically depending on if you're using an existing Lan infrastructure to reach a far away place a Wan port to extend the number of Lan ports um so you're not you don't have to have a whole bunch of things plugged into this I can extend that out here and have this as a Wan Port now I have eight more Wan ports on my router and so or in this case 16 but you know and so and then or I can use like a 20x and convert My Lan ports to wins and so there's three different use cases of the vwan feature based on your topology and I that might be too complicated and I apologize if that was a lie to Travis no I I've got I've got a lot of thoughts on that I mean I I love the way you laid it out because I think that speaks to there's three different whys here right and so if you go back to your drawing it makes perfect sense to me so we'll start out with the you know I own the sdx and I control the the peplink switch here too right let's just say that's the scenario I'm I'm coming in to do this install and I've I'm installing all of this equipment it's all mine and this is great why here I'm gonna run this one cable from my sdx all this could be up you know 15 floors through a concrete building up to a rooftop and I've got two domes up there right the Y is because I don't want to run a whole bunch of cables up there I want to run one cable or maybe there's one cable all there already and they won't let me run any more cables right exactly which is common the commonplace right yep the other why is you know for the second one that you said maybe I don't control this switch right maybe this is the Enterprise it Department switch and they control it and they're not going to let me the pebbling person come in and say anything about that but they'll add a VLAN for me right and they'll add this or that for me right they'll work with me but they won't let me run it right and so that's a different why right I'm the why is because I can't put that switch there it's their switch not not something I can manage now so it's a different situation but you're able to leverage that existing infrastructure without having to run a ethernet cable and a switch right next to the switch that's already there right the why is you're going to save the customer money actually but not ruin your life in the process right right um you know and then I think the third one is just more that that smaller user right why they've got a 20x and they want to add star link to it right they've already got a home you know Wireline connection they want to add a 5G connection that comes with a you know the the carrier supplies the modem with an ethernet port right that's the why on my 20x I just I want more connections so yeah I I agree I think those three there's again there's just lots of different reasons why you might use this feature that might seem like um it's geared to somebody else or maybe you don't see why it would be useful to you yet but it's it's super powerful and um I've used it more than I thought I would use it even since it's been released in just the last few months I found myself deploying this feature a ton uh and so um it's a little more technical I mean it's hard to talk about this one without getting a little bit more technical but I I hope between the two of us we've done a decent job of explaining how I do a full Hands-On entire conversation about just this feature on a 20x so I I if you want to learn more about this on a 20x let me know or go look at that video and I will I will make a setup guide a video separate that's just vwan for Enterprise um out the land and the WAN and demonstrate that via switches um my lab environment that I use my peplink University lab environment I've got my Wan switches and they go into my epx and these wans are really cool because they're they're Wan ports so if I go in this Wan switch I can see my HD1 Dome connected right there so there's my HD1 Dome and that's vwan 1101 but over here these are two Xboxes and they're on My Lan it's their trunk all the guys in the lab it might our lab is in our lobby and they wanted to play with Xboxes and they saw a switch port and they just plugged into the switch port and they're using my epx as the host for that and it and it's trunking because this remember I said Port 49 so I'm coming in on Port 49 and I'm trunking if you see this VLAN 1101 all the way to 1107 and then Port 51 is a 10 gigabit that's only My untagged Lan and my network management and so this this 10 gigabit is Lan going down into my epx this 10 gigabit is wan going down to my epx all on the same peplink 48 Port switch this doesn't have to be a pebbling 48 Port switch it could be any VLAN managed switch and that's important because we're not carrier specific there yeah it doesn't look like right now during business hours either those ports weren't showing any traffic um so so it's it's it's pretty cool to have that um and to show it off um want more there's more 8.3 is loaded with features um if you've been paying the attention to any of my content over the last three months I have been screaming about this new InTouch capability and if you are running large infrastructure small infrastructure if you have iot devices that have serial or HTTP or https interfaces or RDP or VNC um in touch it creates out-of-band connectivity using speed Fusion speed Fusion connect and so what it does is it allows you to add Lan connect devices to in control um so you can you can remote control um that you can log into the web GUI of of us of a non-pep link managed switch or IP camera you can connect into a remote desktop environment for uh for a server or PC uh you can do a VNC connection uh to a server or PC um and now with 8.3 firmware peplink has added the ability to do USB serial connections so you could actually connect a USB to rs232 plug it into any rs-232 device and then actually remote control that device so if you go to settings in touch if you have an oh I I'm so sorry but I forgot to plug it in for this Pro I'm so sorry uh if you have a USB to rs232 it's going to show up right above this IP based option and you can plug that you can then manage uh the rs-232 devices right there and um and then you can then add and manage it connect to those via in touch just like you would like this RDP session coming right into the network and so it with 8.3 firmware we now have the ability to do our USB to rs-232 for any rs-232 applications this eliminates the need for a lot of other applications and it comes free right to any peplink router with a USB port uh super powerful yeah I mean in touch this is just building and expanding on the this whole concept there used to be an Enterprise that still is an Enterprise's concept of out-of-band management and so big companies build networks right next to their their networks so that they can get into their network if their Network fails and if it sounds redundant it is it's intentional right so there's a different path to get in to troubleshoot your network if you know your main Network goes down and so that was the concept and still done today in many cases but within touch you don't need to have a whole separate Network you can just have in touch and you can have in control and you can have that management plan because you already have a whole bunch of connections into your pep link right you don't need another Network because you've already got all these networks built into these boxes and so now you're able to do that with serial devices too so a lot of companies have you know it's either you've got a bank of third-party Network gear like switches and firewalls and stuff that you're managing over serial or sometimes it's industrial or Telemetry applications where you've got sensors and data collection collection device or or control devices to turn things on and off right and so all of these are different ways that you might use a Serial Port but nonetheless if you have a 20x or a balanced 2500 you've got a USB port that you can plug in one of these adapters to and start managing serial devices now too so again kind of a long description but it's just you're get you're able to get so much more functionality out of that box that you bought three years ago right yeah well and most people buy beveling for out of band right the whole idea is the peplink is your is is a lot of people's backup it has that 5G connectivity bonded connectivity that allows them to have that extra reliability those increased nines as as you like to put it Travis and so you're already paying for this extra connectivity now with USB to rs-232 you can just replace another piece of unnecessary Hardware uh with the peplink additionally that's not here but um there's a star tech s-t-a-r-t-e-c-h eight Port industrial USB to rs232 and you can plug that in and give yourself 8 or 16 rs-232s on a single USB port going into a peplink router it's very very common so yeah even if you are going to build an out-of-band management Network you can take a 20x in one of those 16 Port adapters and you can run 16 different network devices now when with full SQL and failover and completely seamless and yeah it's pretty pretty cool um the some increased improvements that we've already talked about this 5gh or cat 20 devices we now support the 2x antenna mode um Wi-Fi Wan now has IP forwarding option so in the Wi-Fi Wan instead of getting a natted IP you can now you can now ip4 that IP right to your to your end devices um 5G or cat 20 devices we have signal threshold settings and if you notice it says 5G not 5gh this would be for all 5G uh routers we now have signal threshold um support um this has been a a highly requested uh feature actually um I see um ipsec uh GCM mode um the new AES GCM mode has now been enabled in 8.3 firmware um the 20x Wi-Fi Wan now is now included with crime care so if your 20x is covered in PrimeCare Wi-Fi Wan is no longer a license upgrade is now a included feature yeah that is that is a long long time request a very very needed uh feature request especially when you're talking about crime care and how it includes a lot of things like speed Fusion connect and all these different options and now adding even more functionality and value to the Prime Care subscription that's already an incredible price point at it current and not this is not a sales call but just adding more value to that already existing awesomeness um DPI is now included in session logging um and so that's been a heavily requested Enterprise feature to get that layer 7 capability built into the session logs um and now with uh with GPS we have an option to turn off GPS and GPS forwarding services so for uh for Enterprise uh security requirements that you might not need to be allowed to have uh GPS capabilities uh we can now turn that off on the cellular enabled routers and so um sort of a lot of things in one and I I don't know if there's any I I don't know how to demonstrate I mean I kind of showed off the uh the signal threshold this is just gooey um it's not like there's nothing fancy there it's just another another security option um but just increase more features um that are available uh built in there I do also I want to segue it this real fast and show you um I can't see oh there we go so if you go to uh if you search peplink open beta I want to show you this real fast um you can get the open beta program um once again for you know as a network engineer this is beta so please understand that uh this is rc3 rc4 is coming out um that's not why I'm showing you this I wanted to show you this because if you look at this release notes if you go to open beta and you'll see this release notes and the PDF I want to read this um it's incredibly powerful um and it shows you notes about which devices are supported um and more importantly for devices that might not be supported in the future um and so it's important to understand where the the life cycle of a lot of your Hardware is um and so I really want to make sure that that you understand that and then next all these features I wanted to take a note on the life cycle thing too Peter because yeah go ahead it's easier it's so often that I overlook kind of like how we behave and then I don't realize how a lot of our competition behaves than just how different our standards are versus some of our competition standards so when we talk about no longer supported all we're saying is we probably won't make more firmware for it that has new features right so that's all we're saying we're not saying it won't work within control anymore it will still work it within control we're not saying it will stop working we're not saying any of that right a lot of vendors will draw those lines right if they say it's not supported anymore it doesn't connect to their Cloud management anymore literally like it's yeah right so that's true it's a very different standard that we hold ourselves to in terms of what the long-term support actually looks like and so in these cases if there's a really critical security vulnerability and history has shown this before we will go back and make firmware for these devices they should state that because it says uh further major firmware is not supported on these um when six point uh 6.3.4 came out there was a security release like way after 7.1 had already been released paplink went back and released a 6.3.5 that had that security patch in it so even though it's a it was a a non updated device um it's still got a security patch um and not saying the peplink will do that for every router no matter how long it goes but it's it's important to understand that major firmware will not be released so so these devices will not get firmware nine um is probably the most important thing to understand um and then you're like we're the most clear and the most accommodating and we just frankly have the longest life cycle and especially in terms of like firmware that comes out after you bought it like I don't know who maintains that longer and that'd be exactly like on that if you go to peplink Firmware download literally every single pep link firmware for every router is downloadable no no no logins no password no serial numbers no gating no check for warranty status it's right there so you don't have to worry about uh not being able to get firmware uh on your routers and I I think that's really cool that peplum does that um so on this on this release notes it's going to give you new features new improvements which we talked a lot about but there's more in here that that we didn't talk about resolved issues this is overlooked a lot and if you're in if you're technical on this webinar I highly advise that you you skim through this because you might have a bug that you that you were kind of like annoyed by or that didn't quite work right these release notes tell you when we when we solve those problems and so I just wanted to Showcase that I love it I love it without Peter because that's a great example of us listening to the customers because we didn't do a good job of that before all right we'd come out with beta 1 beta2 beta 3 beta 4 and I don't know what the difference is right it was really hard to tell frankly because it was moving so fast and it just wasn't getting really communicated well and now you're seeing that right people spoke up and they told us and we get it right we do listen I I just want to emphasize that we really do listen to customers and Implement those things um sometimes it's not as fast as people want but there it is right we're tracking that and we're trying to make it as clear as possible what we're doing every step of the way so as you're waging through that that kind of beta tests you've got more information at your fingertips hopefully um I know there's always things that aren't quite documented when they come out on the first beta but yeah we're trying to make it as cohesive as possible for you right so this next feature uh Travis I'm hoping you can maybe answer because I'm I'm curious if peplink fixed one of my pet peeves with speed Fusion connect relay so speed Fusion connect relay was built as a way to basically take a mobile like your mobile RV and take advantage of your home internet when you don't have a static public IP or even maybe you're netted behind another infrastructure and so speed Fusion connect relay was the idea of being able to bridge two private IP connected devices together using speed Fusion connect this note that came in for this webinar says that um we can access is layer 3 now enabled on speed Fusion connect relay I'm not sure that well that one's curious that's new for me I don't know if that's new in rc3 because uh so I might have to do some testing everybody I do apologize for not being 100 clear on this speed Fusion connect relay though is a great way of connecting to peplink routers that don't have public IP addresses a VPN requires a public IP or at least publicly accessible IP um and so speed future Tech relay was a way of bridging that but in the previous versions it was Internet only it would just basically balance out and go through it looks like 8.3 they've added the ability to have layer 3 connectivity uh and if they've done that I'm gonna be very happy so I will test this lab and I will release a follow-up to this and I apologize for not being ready for this particular slide um but that's really cool yeah I definitely hope that's true because that I mean the Internet only use case was definitely useful for like content you know if you're out traveling and you're trying to watch your home Netflix subscription you know yeah exactly is the way to get back home so that you're not in a data center or on a VPN and you know you're legitimately accessing the content you're supposed to but with the protection of speed fusion and that was one of the big reasons for using relay to begin with um you know firewalling and some of those things sometimes too we saw people using it for unique things but yeah being able to talk inside to your network and similar to that that in touch I think is I hope that's I I need to dig into this is the biggest I will I will lab this after this this webinar and I apologize for not being ready for it um I um speed future relay was sort of like a pet peeve of mine just because I'm a big Network guy and I want to be able to do layer three and it based on this comment from peplink uh marketing it says access your I2 device behind it so I will verify this and then I will release a follow-up and I apologize for for that um Sim switching uh is another feature that added has been heavily requested in my industry at least um and the idea is from in control you can now switch between A and B so if I go to my in control and go to my speed Fusion my Sprinter right from the in control GUI you can see that I'm connected to T-Mobile 5G and I have another sim card I can actually click this and I'm not going to do it because I'm broadcasting live and don't want to be embarrassed if it goes bad but you can click this switch to this card and and it will shut down that T-Mobile and switch to another sim card um which should be Verizon actually um and so super nice feature and the way it does is if you look in the back end what what it does is it's changing that that the priority so what it does in the back end if you were to look at it if I go to my T-Mobile three right here you'll see that a SM a is Priority One and Sim B is probably two so basically what it does is it switches it so that um uh sim a some B is probably one and some a is probably two and so you can switch those dynamically now from in control just by changing those priorities that little deeper is really important too that's kind of like the don't don't hurt yourself kind of thing right like so if you tell it to switch and then it doesn't connect to anything yeah well and that used to be the alternative right Sim B only oh great now SMB doesn't connect and the router's offline so this one if I switch to send b and it doesn't connect it'll at least fail back to sim a which I know is working so it's a great one in regard for a few minutes as you wait for that to play out but you're gonna come back exactly that modem will go dark if it's just a one modem device then you gotta wait for it to come back yeah anyway now I don't know about you Travis but another heavily requested feature is how do I know how my Network's performing and uh and and so peplink has added connection tests to the to in control um so if you're running 8.3 firmware you can now go into in control go to reports and connection test reports or go to give me one second I do apologize uh under the group level um network settings connection tests to configure it um so if you go to network settings connection tests you can configure see daily test of cellular one daily test of cellular2 uh cellular one and cellular two so I could add for example day daily test cell three cellular Wan cellular three and I can do a speed test and then I can say what is my what do I consider a failure um I say I would say if it's under five megabits per second and the up speed upload is lower than two megabits per second consider that a failure and test every day at 7 30 in the morning hit save I have this daily test right here of uh spelled it wrong but I apologize I'm an engineer not a H so sorry save okay there we go and then if I go to reports connection test reports I can see the status of those test reports at quantity um and what the device is and then if I go into a device so I go to my device dashboard click on my screen Fusion Sprinter and go to reports connection test reports that's two different places the device versus the group by going to the device I can actually see those tests for results on a graph and so if you're going where's the graph the graph is in the device level report and I can see those cellular test reports right there um super neat feature uh very very impressed by it yeah and that's you know again the why part right you know so many times you know customers whether you're an individual or or you're a business right you're buying often pebbling to back something up right you want that reliability you want to be taken care of when the the thing that you rely on doesn't work anymore so when you've got an unpredictable link as your backup you know time time goes on right you don't know what's changed in the 12 months since you put that back up in you know you installed it and it was fast and it was great and it worked but you know it's a year later and there's a bunch more customers and maybe it's not fast anymore right I don't know I haven't I haven't failed over so I don't know if it's good or not right like that's the that's the oops thing that happens sometimes is you spend all this money invest all this time into putting a failover solution and then it takes two years to actually need it and then it doesn't work that well because everything changed in that two years and so this makes sure that you're up to whatever your standards are every day every hour whatever you're yeah you know sensitivity is and it does consume your bandwidth so just be aware that you are uh consuming bandwidth then so that's if you're paid by the gigabyte that might cost money and just take that into into account yep but yeah you know this is really to prevent that I spend a whole bunch of money on failover and then the failover thing is totally disappointing when I needed it you know that's that's what we don't want to happen for any of us and that's what that features there to really help prevent so we've talked about a lot of Technologies a lot of features speed Fusion can act speed Fusion connect protect um our Sims um peplink has this new which I kind of highlighted when I was talking about it but like the speed Fusion LTE or speed Fusion 5G data if you're managing your devices you don't want to think about all that and peplink has created an app called speed Fusion connect and and that's it kind of bridges all this together right we've talked about speed Fusion connect LTE or speed Fusion connect protect and um so speedfusion connect or sfc brings all of this together to allow individuals to manage that infrastructure way easier from a simple app and and so the idea is you have a br1 pro 5G you can add it to your speed Fusion Connect app you will see that in in control it is visible and in control as well but but it's going to be configured via this this app and and so I don't use both use one or the other um but this will allow you to subscribe to LTE data it'll allow you to subscribe or refresh your speed Fusion connect protect plan um it'll allow you to switch your own SIM cards bring your own SIM cards that allow you to set up all these outbound policies and traffic shaping um so for a consumer that's maybe looking for a simple way to do all the cool stuff that we just talked about peplink has made the speed Fusion Connect app and um I've played with it a little bit it's kind of neat um I'm I focus more on Enterprise and so I'm hoping Travis will have a more of a consumer touch to that um but um it just for anybody watching this if you're an Enterprise user don't go play with this use it at home um because it does affect in control um and so it's not they're not they're not unified that's gotten a lot better though Peter that that okay good okay that's that was again that was like Beta Trial stuff so the in control it really is there's a story for both right there's a story for the Enterprise side and there's a story for the the individual side and I think the individual one makes makes the most sense to start with because it really feeds the second one too and you know again we just spent over an hour talking about a lot of really cool stuff but again coming back to the why if I'm just an individual I want my zoom in my teams and my you know my communication stuff to work well right and I just want my connectivity to stay out and so that's what this sfc app does it just gives you eyeballs on those few things and it gives you control over those two things right here's my router what's connected what's not what's connected to it right is it a phone is it a tablet you know who's on my router and then you know what do I care about right what do I want to protect I want to make sure that I'm protecting this and this and this and that's what this app does it just gives you those handful of things that you need and you don't have to go in and set profiles and do all these things you just tell it I want zoom to work better and so it's much easier um but on the Enterprise side if you're a managed service provider you might want to extend that level of control to your user base as well right and so you might want to have some sort of Middle Ground where you're actually administering some of the background items but you're giving them visibility and control over what their experience is like day to day and so that it makes sense to them too and so I don't know that that side of the story is 100 baked in the cake yet but that's really the direction that we want to be that's the direction okay I see it so they are working on unifying those two aspects so that you have the back-end engineering with the end user control yo and so you could just be a pure end user and maybe I've got two routers or one router and great this is going to work great for you and you don't have to be on a cloud and log into a computer desktop right it's not that's not how most of us are going to operate this or that in our house or RV right and so I like it I like that it's ready to go on that and you can buy data on there too right you've got T-Mobile you've got Verizon grade use them you're going to get a great deal from them that's awesome but when you get into the sticks and you don't have coverage or you know whatever reason you need another option you can just push some push a few buttons on that app and you can buy data right now over the air push that Sim to your router that's what the app does and so it makes it much more controllable you know much easier for that user to control their experience and you know buy that data when they need it but you know not sign up for something they're not sure if they're going to use either too that makes sense well I will uh I will uh download that again and then I will create a follow-up video just on speed Fusion connect um so uh I think we need to do a webinar I think that'll be a good webinar topic for us yeah it would be a good webinar I think it would be a good webinar just to talk about that and we can set up the app and um yeah reprogram my my 5G router here my my RV to to use all the different functionality because you know I've been playing around with all these different connections and uh I installed my starlink on on Friday so I've got that new Big starlink Dish on the top of it now and so I've got my starlink and the 5gs and my my Max adapter so this whole thing's like a mobile peplink bonding machine um and your house some days so we are over time but we have a lot of questions I I do we want to try I can we try to establish a few questions here can you see my screen if I said if I show that I probably can't I can't right now I don't see anything except for this one but um um well all models support um to choose prefer um yeah 4G already lets you have um uh the the carrier preferred carrier selection so so it should yes the answer should be yes um should be yes but there might be one modem from one region from three years ago yeah I don't know right there's going to be a detail in there that I don't know but I know that on my br1 Pro 5G um on my epx which is 4G so if we pull up the br1 pro 5G or br1 mini I apologize um if I pull that up I believe I get the same that's running 8.3 it's a 4G modem and if I pull that up VR1 I apologize here br1 Mini the the background on that one is it's a modem dependent feature and so if the modem supports that feature then we can implement it and if it's supported over the years we probably have and that's why it wasn't there on the 5G modems is the modem vendors literally didn't have those those commands built in their firmware yet the 5G and so then they got that firmware there and then we actually implemented it in our firmware and we have to make sure that we upgrade their modems to get that you know I mean so there's a there's a lot of Tetris being played to get those little things that really matter a lot to people and seem so easy but um you know and that's there might be a modem you know a 4G modem from three years ago that didn't support that I don't know right but almost guaranteed if it's a 4G modem it should be there but um uh Casey asked a really good question about in control um Dynamic weighted bonding has actually been in in control for a long time um so so uh I was at it was said uh does uh is the default for dynamic weighted bonding true within control two um as well and TCP ramp up um those features actually are in in control um if you click star let me just um I don't know if it's gonna let me click next because I don't have a router um Let me let me pull up let me pull up my uh I actually have a bonding demo speed Fusion overview I was actually working on uh I was actually working on a dedicated video just for these features so I've got uh my two sites this is actually a different YouTube video but I'm gonna show it anyways so if I go to configuration and in control click edit I've got my two sites click next click next and you'll see um you don't see Dynamic weighted bonding but if you click this check box show Advanced features there's Dynamic weighted bonding and in control right there so if you're if you need to enable Dynamic one but weighted bonding and in control um you just gotta click this show Advanced features and then TCP ramp up is a per device option so it's going to be under link settings so if I click Advanced Link settings then I can click sorry this uh this box is in my way um then I can click the edit option right here and TCP ramp up is gonna embarrass me here GCB ramp up will come right here uh I do apologize so tsp ramp up is not it's in my other uh other environment that's uh not available publicly yet so TSB ramp up will come to in control but Dynamic weighted bonding isn't in control already and I so um the modem router firmware thing right that that little yeah well they've got to build it out and then get it get it pushed out um so TCP ramp up is not enabled yet and in control but a dynamic weighted bonding is at least in in public versions of in control um should be ramp up uh replacement TCP ramp up isn't a replacement for wound smoothing um it's it's a compliment to Dynamic weighted bonding which in some scenarios can be a replacement for land smoothing um but when smoothing has a very unique purpose and it's to handle Jitter and latency and so I don't want to just blanketly say it's a replacement it's it's complementary to Dynamic weighted bonding to to merge the the idea of saving bandwidth while increasing reliability which is the whole purpose of wind smoothing wind smoothing is going to take packets to make it the best they can yeah it's it's something it's a middle ground and it's it's I think most specifically designed like you said just get things downloading faster faster um but so it doesn't replace when it's moving like you said either I mean but it can get you closer to replacing winds moving in a lot of cases too I feel like it you know for real-time media the only way you can be as confident as possible is to use land smoothing right that that's the only that's going to give you the ultimate reliability period for real-time applications but Dynamic weighted bonding with TCP ramp up is going to get you pretty close to that Mark so it's just a value decision on your part is how much does that data cost and how much of this traffic am I actually duplicating versus doing the ramp up thing so somebody asked um if uh these features will be available in a balance 20. um these features will be available and balance 27 and 8 but not future major releases so so if you're running older balanced 20s those have already been um depreciated um to the 7.1.2 I believe firmware um and the newer balanced 20s this Hardware seven and eight will support 8.3 in these features but not um not going to be uh beyond that so I'd probably suggest looking at the balance 20 X's or some variant thereof As you move forward um one of the Hang-Ups on the 20 to the 20x was there's just not one there's only one Lan Port right and so a lot of customers on the 20 just kind of felt islanded there and now with virtual land you can do that somebody asked a really good question about warranty and I don't know if we want to answer that or not publicly but basically it says that do remote Wan devices the Synergy devices need a warranty I'm going to say yes um I need an active care plan yeah okay they need an active care plan um to be connected so these devices are uh pushing pushing out um so yes yes some form of okay good thank you yeah so it's part of find care and or essential care um can uh can can it use a lan Port uh like vwan um yes you can use the the Lan Port actually we our last video covers that um so you can pull that up to 20x video I'm not trying to networks Synergy mode that one I'd have to run a network design on for a guy named uh uh asks about uh 20x's in Synergy or about two balanced routers and Synergy mode Synergy mode just brings the wands over so it's not going to be networks it's only the wands so think about that device being almost a dead device the lands don't aren't going to function or shouldn't function even if you even if you plug into them they do function you shouldn't be using them that way the wands are being brought to that Synergy device so Synergy mode takes the wands of a synergized device and brings them to the host so those synergize devices should not have anything connected into them you know adjusting to big changes in bandwidth on the link that's absolutely exactly what dynamic weighted bonding is designed to deal with and it wasn't a bug it was it's just hard it's just yeah yeah it's just handling TCP and congestion um uh somebody asked a question about um will all models support Synergy mode um right here so so if you go to that data sheet you can see the the device supported of a feature right here in the data sheet so you can see the balance routers the max the X Series and things like that so uh that that's right in the data sheet for those details how are you going to Top This in nine uh there's a lot of cool Enterprise stuff it coming in nine I can't say that for sure but I I definitely just keeps amazing me over and over and over again with what they do and I think we're gonna like that uh no when I say don't know you can tell us is my answer you tell us yeah because that's we get more ideas from everybody else in our own for sure if every new feature takes on a new device or new new capability like pebbling will add a new feature like like the br1 which then got paired with 580s to create an hd4 with a 580 and four br1s and then the the four the hd4 was made born I mean every time they create a new product or a new feature it it increases the capabilities of of the users you and then we get more products it just gets better and better um this actually is a common complaint or a question I actually want to clarify it um somebody asked uh when you say Dome are you referring to an antenna I am not referring to an antenna I'm referring to the peplink HD1 Dome um so if you go to peplink.com foreign so you have the HD1 Dome it's it's actually a router and antenna it's like a br1 with antennas and an IP67 chassis um incredibly powerful um they have a 5G version and a 4G version um I use it for a a huge amount of my mobile Healthcare vehicles and command Vehicles whereas the antenna is the mobility so when I say Mobility 42g or else sometimes I'll just say 42 G or a maritime 42g those are the antennas that have the four you know cables dangling out from the bottom of them this is just a Cat6 cable that goes from the Dome to an sdx or an epx or a Poe enabled uh port on a on a peplink or anything really and um and so that the Dome is actually an antenna and modem all combined into one nice IP67 chassis yeah so like if if you look at Peter's got the sdx pro right you can buy an Ethernet module for it you can buy a flex module and slide those ethernet cards in and then you can get the mobility 42g and you screw those coax cables to those slots and then you run your coax out to you know however far away you need to do it right and then you've got signal loss over that cable and it's all fine that's how antennas work um or you can do what Peter's showing here and he's taking those domes not the antenna only but that product the Dome and he's using it basically as a lossless antenna right he's taking the radio and the antenna and using an ethernet cable instead of all those coax cables and the ethernet cable doesn't lose signal so you've got the radio and the signal all outside in the best spot possible and then it's much easier to run the wires so yeah Peter when you say domes I that makes sense I mean I I love hearing people ask those questions because yeah to me it's the HD1 dome but yeah all antennas a lot of antennas look like domes and yeah you can do it both ways but there's reasons for either um so another question about 5G modems and the certification if you just Google pebbling Verizon certification you get this um uh pebbling tries to release all this information they tell you which devices the most up-to-date information is well actually this one is not up to date um that's a press release sorry yeah there's c-band that link has yeah there we go so we're now c-band certified and you got the right here the hd4mbx the br1 pro the VR2 Pro the mbx mini um but where I wanted to show you is this learn more should go to the Forum and the Forum is going to give you the active information about what's going on um with our certification process so um if you just do a quick support for Verizon c-band or Verizon 5G certification um you can get this forum post and then it's going to give you all the details about um the the status of of our certification process um somebody asked if the the multi-port serial adapter for for InTouch uh the answer is yes we use the Star Tech I personally use the start Tech 8 Port really easily and the four port also works and so does the 16. um but I think the release don't have an important detail though you have to make sure you have the right chipset of device because not yeah it's the startup just if it's star tech Industrial um RS 232 USB it's specifically this industrial one um it looks like foreign it's the star tech Industrial rs-232 um not not the other one it has it's it is a specific chipset and it is in the release notes Frank Tom Denver India I don't know I don't know the phonetic Alpha but that will but ftdi is the chipset keyword you want to look for in those Star Tech adapters but most of them are but um yeah it's this industrial the industrial one has that chipset um but yeah check the chipset and check the release notes um before you buy it I've I've played with um the the eight port and the 16 port and they've worked really well but I do know that the night these plastic ones just check check before you'd use them yeah and they're really inexpensive I mean for what what you're able to do with it yeah yeah it's it's not expensive at all about land folks only I've heard paid option uh vwan functionality is a paid upgrade um it you get one free with PrimeCare on some devices um but but the vwan functionality is a paid license upgrade but it's a one-time um and then as far as there being a number um I don't know officially uh what the product skus are but I've got 40 on my epx so I I know that we can support a lot I mean so this is my epx with 40 V wans so it I we can get a lot I think we can wrap up for today unless you yeah yeah we'll wrap up there's a lot of questions if you have more questions feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn um I'm very active there um or or reach out to to sales at um peplink.com or sales at uh westnetworks.com and we'd be more than happy to help you out and answer questions um and or reach out to the Forum Community yeah we we've waked at a time I apologize I can talk forever on peplink um so but yeah if you reach out to us we'd love to answer any additional questions you have and talk about 8.3 firmware just love that so many people are still on here so thank you all so much yeah staying 30 minutes late I just for me to scroll through a whole bunch of questions I I love this community I love you guys so much I just it's all fun and I am in my RV in Houston Texas and if you happen to be around Houston Texas I've got my marketing team made these uh shirts Professor p these are REI really really comfortable shirts so even if you don't like the picture on it super ridiculously comfortable so if you happen to find me in my RV uh you can bump into me and get a free uh free shirt so um but other than that have a great day and never stop playing so thank you for joining us thanks folks bye"}

got I thank everybody who's going to be here here so we're gonna get started so this is a follow-up webinar we had a webinar I think a little bit over a month ago we showed you folks lots of different scenarios that people are using the combination of starlink and peplink out in the field and there's lots of reasons why people are doing that and so today we're going to go one step further and show you actually how to configure peplink and starlink when you're using it out out in the field um before we do that though we're going to talk a little bit more about some of the background here Starling can and peplink it it's it's a really popular topic right now and I think there's a lot of reasons for that but we'll dig into that a little bit before we show you how to configure everything um for those of you that don't know our guests today we've got Peter West from West networks we also call him professor P he's running the uh peplink U webinar series again focused on showing you how to configure all sorts of the great features in pep links so thank you Peter and then we've also got Martin langmaid Martin langmate is from then Telecom over in Belgium but he's located in the UK thank you Martin for joining us as well and myself Travis Derek I'm product manager here at peplink so Peter and Martin have a whole bunch of hands-on experience with starlink out in the field and myself a little bit as well but definitely those two have deployed I think more Starling dishes than just about anybody out there right now um and I think to open this up again we want to give you a little bit more background as to why we're talking about peplink and Starling right starlink's there and yeah I can get internet from space and that's great right but there's more to it right and there's more there's it's not just that simple and so um I think to start out we're going to talk about some of the different connectivity options that are out there and start to compare these things and show you kind of how unique starlink is but also where some of the problems might lie when you're using starlink as well um Peter I think you really kind of wrapped this up in a in a way that I found super easy to understand in terms of explaining the different connection types and the different kind of promises or rights behind those different connection methods do you want to just kind of walk me through that again I thought that was super interesting and helpful definitely and uh thank you for having me on this uh this webinar share more information with people um yeah so a lot of times when we're talking about connectivity and expectations it they don't necessarily go hand in hand you know you have carriers saying hey we offer you know gigabit throughput or you know 5G is the next thing and it can go up to 10 gigs but we have to ask what does that mean and where are we at and what the SLA or the quality or guarantee of that service might be and so I've I've defined the internet or Internet providers there's three different options and this is by no means uh documented or a standard it's my way of explaining it to myself to comprehend it but if you think of like let's start with the best you think of like something like a fiber circuit you sign a contract you have an SLA you get one gigabit of internet and you're paying for one gigabit internet and if you don't get one gigabit they owe you something they owe you a technical response they owe you may maybe a credit on your bill if you can prove which good luck but if you can prove that you're not getting it um and so we call that SLA service right service level agreement I'm getting what I pay for and I know I'm going to get that then you have uh your FiOS your cable modems your DSL modems these guys are what we call um they are services that you pay for a a speed range like I'm gonna pay for a 100 by 10 megabit or a 300 by 50 meg uh cable modem or FiOS or whatever maybe even a gig by a gig FiOS or some variant thereof but they're not there's no SLA Associated them what they're doing is they're they're out there selling these services and they're filling up their their pops or you know their points of presence and and they have got hubs and those hubs have like maybe a one gig or a 10 gig circuit to it and then they're selling 300 one gig lines and so we call this best effort what they're doing is saying hey you can get up to a gig but but not necessarily you're going to get always a gig and so I call this best effort and the reason why this is so much so different than the next level is they are at least trying to give you that throughput and that's the difference they have a subscription algorithm they're monitoring the usage on their hubs and they say hey we want if you do a speed test we want to see the the majority of the time you're getting that gig of throughput and so that's why we consider this best effort they're going to do the best they can to provide you that throughput but it's not there's no contractual guarantee for that throughput then we have the next level and this is everybody everybody else uh your your cellular providers your Wi-Fi providers um your uh your your uh your shared Starling uh not I won't say starlink your shared satellite services um where basically what they're giving you is access to the network and there's a theoretical cap right I mean 4G you can buy a 4G cat 18 modem that's rated at 1.2 gigabits per second I don't think you're gonna get 1.2 gigabits per second what you're doing is you're paying for access to the network and there are limitations and and they try to give you throughput but you're sharing that throughput with a bunch of other people and they're and because it's all roaming most the time like cellular that there's certain amount of bandwidth at a tower and that Tower is there and so they're giving hey you're gonna get access to this network but there's no guarantee of throughput and that's the biggest difference between an access agreement and a best effort agreement um and so when I'm working on setting I'm a big believer in expectations and so when we're talking about mobile Health Care Enterprise connectivity or even trying to stream Netflix uh in your in your RV making sure you understand that I'm trying to achieve you know an x amount of bandwidth 20 Megs for a nice little 4K video download or some parent thereof is that the carriers are not guaranteeing throughput on on especially cellular networks there's no guarantee of throughput and as much as I truly enjoy playing with starlink that's not guaranteed either they're you're getting access to the starlink infrastructure but it's not guaranteed throughput and so we have to we have to manage that the best we can I hope that wasn't too long no it makes sense I mean we've got like Enterprise Wireline is what you're calling the SLA right you've got an actual guarantee an actual reimbursement mechanism and uh time to repair kind of uh along with that right and then I think very similar is the the wire line more Broadband right there's no guarantee but you're basically writing the same type of technology in most cases so it's just a lower tier of maybe the same or similar service is that you think that makes sense I mean a lot of them are running the same right my well actually my Cox fiber is directing to Cox but my Unity fiber shared with other people around but I still am paying for that one gig and I or three gigs and I get that three gigs every time I test it and then last but not least is that that 4G 5G and I think starlink fits into this category as well is we're all given the right to access the network and sometimes there might be a little bit more priority of one user versus another but not necessarily and yeah if it's there it's there and if it's not it's not it's kind of but it sounds like you're you're paying for right is we've built this network and you can go use it wherever you like or you know however we've said you can use it and you get what you get kind of kind of service right exactly okay and that so that makes sense to me um I think Martin you can definitely understand where some problems show up in that you know as you move up or down that ladder there's surely problems that show up as you get lower and lower on that on that tier of of access Technologies um yeah look we can't uh I think it's wrong to be too tough on selling and the and the you know the situation here it is it is as Peter says it's exactly that it's shared bandwidth uh you you unless you're on a service that has prioritized data but even then if you've got dishes with the or all prioritized all accessing the same cell you still got sharing going on there too so I bang with showing definitely happens uh we've seen it and there are certainly reports in certain geographies of it being more of a problem than others but at the same time uh the starlink's launching more satellites uh more ground safeties are being deployed there's a there's a um a capacity race going on isn't there where as as the number of subscribers increase the the number the coverage increases the density of satellites increases so it is so similar to 4G in fact I I tend to refer to it as LT from space it's the it's a very very similar situation when we're working with starting as to when we're working with with 4G in the early days honestly you know yeah and I think that's a good point I mean it's it's very unfair to talk about these problems as if it's somebody's fault or it's you know exactly poor design because you know Wireless is shared by Nature right it's in the air and it's it's an open medium right and so there's only so much you can do to isolate that right you can use directional antennas and things like that but you're still going to be sharing people within some sort of an area just because it's wireless you're going to hear those other other devices and it's a lot different than a wire right you can it's a much easier proposition to guarantee service quality on a wire that's just your environment not everybody else out there and so yeah it's helpful to keep that in perspective because it's frustrating sometimes when you're just not getting the service that you need and it's often not somebody's fault it's just the nature of the technology for better or worse but nonetheless we got to solve these problems and get people connected the way they want to and make it act like Wireline and I think that's really what peplink and starlink is all about is trying to make that starlink or any any wireless service that has those natural limitations behave more like that wire line service so that it's predictable in a way that businesses are wanting to use it um yeah and I think also we shouldn't ignore the fact that what are we comparing Sterling to actually right now we're being a little bit unfair and that we're comparing it to 4G but if you look at the other other options in this field the other satellite connectivity options its head and shoulders above so many other different types of services out there right you know even even those services that I have dedicated bandwidth over satellite are so expensive in comparison uh so so we're I think we're all in in agreement that this um the stunning is changing uh the the the uh the industry is changing how our perception of of connectivity and certainly at Sea and in remote locations it's it's really turning everything on its head isn't it uh and it's it's as exciting as it is sometimes frustrating yeah I think you know regardless of the technology there's probabilities that might change but no matter what the technology is Wireline 4G 5G some sort of satellite-based Technology there's congestion and there's just interruptions right those are basically the two things that you're going to fight congestion is going to happen even on those guaranteed networks every now and then you're going to see that happen it's much more rare there but not impossible and much more likely As you move you know into the more shared types of connections and so what do you guys see in terms of congestion I mean that's kind of a kind of a hard to pick apart word but how does that play out in day-to-day use case or how do users see that or feel that we have peaches you want to go on that first uh you know once again because I primarily focus in that that high bandwidth uh Enterprise space that I mean we that's actually the number one way that we identify the type of Pep link we want right is how do I mitigate congestion because as you're roaming around or as you're streaming uh multiple cameras or uh Healthcare records or Pax Imaging files uh congestion is visible very clearly we can see the different carriers all trying trying their best right trying trying to give us that connectivity but we're fighting with everybody else on that network to use that same connectivity and we're all trying to get our piece of the pie and um and so you know one of the ways that I mitigate that is quantity right if I have two att's and two T-Mobiles and two starlinks and two Verizon's um or 10 and 10 and 10. I can I can overcome or at least combat congestion because that definitely for us it that's it's where we see the the largest challenge is how to to achieve the bandwidth we want when we're congested because when you're great you know your phone hotspot when you run a speed test looks great right it's when it's not great it's when you're trying to continuously stream uh large amounts of data over a period of time that we need to be able to combat congestion yeah and it's you know congestion can be hard to see sometimes from a user I feel like because you know there's different methods that these networks use to deal with that right again this isn't a bad thing they're trying to make it work as best as possible for everybody and so they have to use different strategies to you know share the share the pipe as much as they can but um you know so they'll do things like burst your traffic right so you'll if you watch uh somebody on a throttled or some sort of congested connection you'll see them Peak up to 10 Megs and then they'll drop down to no Megs and then 10 Megs and then no Megs right they'll do this bursty kind of thing and that's fine for downloading files right you're going to average out some sort of pretty reasonable speed and cool we'll kind of let people take turns but when we're doing a real-time call like this up down up down up down or latency going from 50 milliseconds to 500 milliseconds that ruins these types of applications and so you know that's where you you hear people all the time like oh yeah I've got gigabit Comcast at my home I'm not trying to pick on anybody again right I've got gigabit service at my home but gosh my zoom or teams just doesn't work right I can run a speed test I'm getting 800 Megs but my zoom is garbage I think a lot of times that's congestion right that's that kind of Boogeyman that nobody really understands why it works like this or it doesn't work like this it's kind of nitty-gritty stuff that's not very intuitive for you you know the users out there trying to just make their calls work at least at the beginning has been speed tests you know that everybody who deployed starting which is incredibly easy to do and powers that sort itself out gets you connected and then they immediate your speed test and typically that's a really nice uh result but as you say when we look at doing this in the field and when we're combining multiple starlinks cellular as well when we're really pushing for as much bandwidth as possible it becomes about the quality and reliability of the link much more than the total bandwidth because when we look at bandwidth itself uh and when we see those Peaks and we see the latency Rising as we are loading up a connection and then uh and then the burst finishes and then your throttle back and your buffers fill up it's it's a it's a really messy Connection in that respect and having needing a technology that can spot uh congestion or spot the the symptoms of congestion and react to it and dynamically deal with it that's uh that's what pearling's been doing on cellular for so long and it's just a natural step for us to be treating styling Connections in a very similar way to get the best out of them um yeah yeah so I'm going to switch over and I'm just going to dive into a unit that I've got set up here I've got a starlink and a 5G connection and I think we can start to see some of these things in in action here and start connecting dots for some people and for those of you watching we're gonna use this as a way to kind of Step into the configuration aspect of you know we've talked a little bit about the problem the different connections out there and now we're going to dive into how do we actually use these com these connections together to solve these problems for people so I've got a router here I've got the peplink br2 pro I've only got one of the Cellular Connections in use so you know practically speaking this would totally apply to a br1 pro 5G as well I've got a starlink connection on the ethernet one and then I've got a T-Mobile 5G connection on the built-in 5G radio and so you can see I've got those two connections there and then I've got a couple other speed Fusion connections down here I've got a speed Fusion VPN to a privately hosted Fusion Hub over in Azure nope and I just got logged out I'm going to pause my share and log in quick again okay we're getting back in okay so I've got my my br2 Pro here again I've got that starlink connection plugged into the ethernet port and then I've got the T-Mobile 5G connection I've got my privately hosted Fusion Hub on Azure if I've got business applications running I can send traffic over there and then I've got speed Fusion connect I've got two different tunnels set up there I've got a hot failover and a dynamic bonding tunnel setup and so I'll show you how I'm using those here and kind of what that looks like in practice so we said you know congestion and the latency spikes is kind of our enemy in terms of you know what makes real-time video and voice applications go bad and what makes them kind of unpredictable and it's that those fluctuations in that latency so these are those same three speed Fusion connections that we showed you earlier and we're using them in different ways here so um on the speed Fusion connect I've got a hot failover so I'm using starlink as the primary I'm only sending traffic that goes through that connection of starlink and then if that fails it's going to seamlessly switch me over to that T-Mobile 5G so I'm not going to burn my T-Mobile bandwidth I'm just going to use the starlink whenever it's there but for other applications like what we're doing right now I want to use both at the same time and so I've got zoom and teams and those applications protected through Dynamic weighted bonding so it's actively using both of these connections at the same time but my file downloads my file uploads they're not going to use T-Mobile and starlink at the same time I've only told it to use that that combination for the really critical applications so you know I'll spend that extra bandwidth on the the real-time stuff with T-Mobile and starlink but I won't do that for again the regular traffic that isn't as important but nonetheless Martin you said Starling kind of works like LTE from space and I think the first thing that I see right away is yeah I see that here right the latencies are almost identical between a 5G connection and a starlink connection but one's on the ground and one's above up above me and so I think that's pretty interesting just from a technology standpoint but um do you want to just talk a little bit about kind of how that differs from the traditional satellites and you know where latency was on those versus starlink sure yeah I mean so there's two things here for me and you you encapsulated it beautifully there where LTE is like left to right and starlink is up and down and whenever we're thinking about reliability and connections we want those connections to come from different places right so even if we're just doing cellular we're doing directional antennas we always try and point our antennas in different Compass points to get different Towers different operators and this is just an extension of that where we're using a different technology and getting the connection from a completely different location so that's in as the first step is brilliant obviously and then from a latency perspective yeah I mean static latency has been really really good and very comparable to to LTE and um and as an as if you compare it to other satellite systems that are out there of course those satellites are much higher much further away latency is is uh is considerably higher than what we'd see on starlink and and this is why everybody's excited right so finally we've got a satellite link that not only is really good bandwidth but also has a latency characteristic which makes you feel like you're just connected to the internet normally um yeah it's brilliant very cool so yeah I'm I've got the graph up here and you you can watch over time these these will populate with different different statistics for each connection but um nonetheless yeah they change each one of them changes minute by minute second by second and it's nice to see that we have satellite technologies that perform this well though because when you're combining these connections it's more ideal if they behave somewhat similarly right so if you've got latencies that are like 800 or 900 or a thousand milliseconds like a traditional satellite combining that with a terrestrial 4G 5G isn't always as useful as you'd like it to be right you can hand you can fail over but actively using those together isn't going to be as effective because the ground-based stuff is going to arrive very quickly and the satellite stuff is going to arrive much later than that and so putting it all together slows everything down but when you've got those latencies closer and you're only fluctuating a little bit here and there it's a much more effective combination and just works for all kinds of applications better um last thing I'll show you before I hand it over to you Martin is just how I set this up right so I've set this up already I'm not going to walk you through every single step of the configuration but the really important part is number one how do I get that how do I get that speed Fusion connect uh established and then how do I actually get the traffic that I care about over there and so if I look at my sfc protect tab over here um I clicked on this client mode for outbound access so I'm going to protect anything that I'm sending out to the internet as kind of the the background on that and here I've got this speed Fusion connect profile and so I've set up these two different profiles I've got this hot failover profile and to do that I just said starlink is Priority One and T-Mobile is priority two that's it that's hot failover so the router's gonna know hey if starling's healthy I'm going to use that and if it's not then I'm going to shift those packets right down to that T-Mobile connection so it's pretty straightforward right didn't have to do a whole lot there's a lot of settings in front of me but I didn't have to use all those I just had to set that those priorities and I could have just clicked save there if I didn't want any more profiles but to do the dynamic weighted bonding it's not much different you can have just set the priorities to one and one so I'm combining those two links actively now sometimes you'll see different combinations where you've got more links and I think Peter will get into this but you could have multiple ones and then you'd have multiple twos or a single two so you can you can kind of group your connections together in in strategies that you think will work well so if I've got a really reliable wire line I could fail over from that just as Priority One and then I could have a starlink and a 5G combined as priority two or I could have two star links for priority two so again when you map out those like priorities that's using them at the same time and then you're setting your failover um order there so again lots of buttons you can push but you really don't need to push almost any of them so nonetheless that was all set up before now the only thing that I had to do after that was set the outbound policy so that I would actually push the traffic that I was concerned about to those right places and so I'm using that using our in control outbound policy manager so I go under network settings I can go to outbound policy and so this test profile is the one that I set up so I've got two profiles here this two rules here I've got this real-time conferencing rule that I set up so all I did to do this was I came under here the destination is software as a service I think by default it's set to any but these are applications that we've built real-time signatures for so that any traffic that you're sending to these applications or services are going to be immediately recognized and sent sent to the place that you wanted to go to and so I've picked a bunch of popular real-time applications here Zoom Skype Skype and teams WebEx all those fun services and then I've set it to a priority algorithm so in in my case I know I would prefer it most to be on this Dynamic weighted bonding where I'm actively using both at the same time if that's not working for some reason then I'm telling it okay fail over to that hot failover and if that's not there then push me over to that that privately hosted Azure Fusion Hub that I've got so in my case I have a lot of options that I can I can step through to and still keep my my applications protected pretty well last but not least when when none of those that I've listed out are available what do I do and in this case I'm telling it go to the next rule um and then this is terminate sessions on link recovery if one of these links becomes healthy again do I want to push my traffic back up the ladder to those links and in this case I've said yes the only other rule that I've got is this default Rule and this is just telling me hey use starlink first for anything that's not those real-time applications I want to just use Starlight because that's cheaper bandwidth in my world it's cheaper than the than the 5G connection I have in terms of metering so in in my case if it's not zoom or teams or one of those real-time applications then it's gonna it's gonna hit this Rule and pick one of those two so that was really all I had to do if we go back to the router you can see this is that private profile that I've got and then I've got the outbound policy here these are those rules that I set up so that's how it flows right I don't have to do much day to day I don't have to think about it right any laptop that I get on this router is going to protect zoom and teams it's going to send it that right way and my Netflix my you know cat videos those things are just going to go out start link and not get metered for me so again there's a few steps in there but at the end of the day you don't have to push that many buttons to get it all get all working and protect those applications that matter to you so Martin I'll stop sharing my screen and hand it over to you if you want to walk us through a few things so I've set up a demo like somebody to demo I said I've got the environment here together uh which is actually a deployed site this is my parents house and as we all know when we're giving support the parents become the most important people that need support in their lives they are quite demanding as a customer and interestingly uh my current situation is that my Sterling has a fault so that's kind of nice I'm going to get to show you today uh not only the configuration that we're typically using but also how well it's coping with failover to Cellular so this is a balance 20x we've got a residential stylingcon wow one and I've got a Vodafone uh 4G connection in the in the 20x itself let's just go and have a quick look at the UI so we can see that the WAN which is the starlink has failed it's ping test uh and we'll I'll investigate that in a minute let's pretend it's working and I'll walk through the configuration and show you how I've got it set up and um and explain why and then we can have a look at the styling bit in a second um but we've so I'm using SSC protector as well and um if we look at that configuration I too have got two tunnels set up we've got the first one which is dynamic bonding Dynamic bonding is amazing 18.3 this is uh the release candidate two running on here at the moment I love Diamond rated bonding eye please is going to talk about it in his demo in a bit but it's just it's just rocking my world when it comes to how successful it is at combining these things uh and I've got so I've got two tunnels here I've got the primary tunnel which is diameter bonding and I've got a second tunnel which is one thing and um for me I like to generally push traffic out to the internet and direct and then I like to um use the bonding for specific applications or specific devices um and particularly when it comes to windsmithing Wednesday I like to use for real-time stuff like video and VOIP because it just gives us gives me the best possible chance of getting that connectivity through and we'll look at how we do that and that's the next step so I'm rooting in this case by both application so clicked here and you'll see that I've got my two tunnels dynamically to bonding and then the subtunnel which is why I'm soothing and uh and for one smoothing I'm sending zoom and Skype traffic or Microsoft teams as well because we do a lot of in our family so especially around Christmas time so this guarantees that traffic because it's duplicating the packets over both styling convert the phone when they're both happy and healthy links that is and then in the for General bonding I'm putting the business apps and the reason I'm doing that is because uh what I want to do is Bond the upload path on LTE and starlink um because uh there's a lot of file transfer that goes on there's a lot of dumping of photos from cameras onto um into Dropbox there's OneDrive usage and starlink in in this particular deployment we're seeing around about 10 Meg upload I can get another 10 to 15 Meg on the 4G connection so by bonding them together that it's just a much better user experience things happen faster I should mention that the 4G connection in this case is a Vodafone unlimited Sim in the here in the UK um it's not truly unlimited as very few things are I think generally speaking it's about 650 gig a month if you hit that too often then better friend tend to get a little bit upset but for all intents and purposes and for the amount of traffic that moves this configuration works very well for them Sean I guess there's a couple different things that you and I have already shown so number one Martin and I basically achieved almost the same thing using two very different tools and so I used in control to manage my policies where you're logged into the router and you just use the the sfc protect tab to set up on pretty much all of this as well and neither one's right or wrong they're just both valid ways that you can do this depending on kind of who you are and how many devices you're managing and so I'm glad that you walk through this way as well because for somebody that's just got one box this is just the easy way for sure and this is that's exactly it right if when we when we're managing hundreds of devices for customers when we're uh when when it's a standard kind of deployment then I absolutely be using control and outman policies there for that it's you want to have the same configuration everywhere absolutely go ahead and do that actually this uh this approach on this device I've literally just pulled this device out of a different organization in control to give you a clean visual today um so rather than rebuilding in control I just did it on the device it's um you can do it either place of course right um uh so I've done that and then I've also set up root by Lang client because on this network there's a VoIP pan set which is used for you know obviously Sip and VOIP and I specifically want all of that traffic from that device to go over oops that's missing tunnel uh that was from an early configuration I can fix that on the Fly there we go uh so I specifically want all the traffic from the VoIP handset to go over the one two thing so that we've got the best possible chance of getting that um that void traffic which is very small bandwidth really uh across to the uh the the Sip service that we're using so that's those two um I think that's a great um use of that client too because sometimes sometimes it's really easy to just say oh put my laptop in there but then you know your laptop is going to do 5 10 15 different applications right it's not just doing a VoIP call right you're uploading files and so suddenly you're duplicating all your traffic instead of where the phone it's only going to be doing voice so it's very reliably only going to be sending those calls back and forth and you don't have to worry about running a whole bunch of bandwidth through it so yeah I like I mean they're two different tools and there's a good reason for that right the the zoom in teams I don't care what device is coming from just protect that no matter what and then yeah your phone that's a very predictable device and one kind of use case we have a lot of clients that use that for uh like like Amazon TVs and things like that because you want that traffic not to use SSE protect usually because VPN blocking so you can say hey if the destination is if the source is this Amazon TV don't you know use a different application you know policy so yep yeah that's a good point too yeah sometimes you want to avoid it because yeah the video streaming services are very protective about using Data Centers and vpns and those things so yeah those are things you don't want to necessarily run through sfc protect exactly right yeah and then just to talk about this briefly so how do we identify the client well I'm running DHCP on the on the device here so I've come into status and client lists and I've I've actually done a dtp reservation which you can do when when by clicking on the button next to the device which is great uh so that's that then locks that device to that IP address and then uh which helps you with reaching your traffic and identifying it later but also what's cool about that then is if that device and I've done that same thing to the printer as well if we if we know that the IP addresses of the devices aren't going to change we can then use InTouch and I love InTouch and I can't do webinar without showing it so this is what we're going to do right now but it's also highlighting that when you're on a service like starlink or indeed 4G in your behind carrier grade Nat so there's no inbound routing possible um one of the big benefits for remote support which I do a lot on this on this particular you know deployment is this ability to do in touch which gets us around the need for for inbound port forwarding as it creates this proxy connection to that device on the network so here I am uh now at that uh that VoIP handset and I can connect to that and manage it easily remotely so yeah big deal this capability is so big and you you set it right away as you know starlink does not allow inbound access right so you can't do port forwarding and you know reach out to these devices you need to use something like this to kind of um you're not breaking the rules but you're just it's technically a different way to do it but nonetheless you get that experience of oh I can log into my device remotely and yeah I don't have the security exposure of public IPS and open ports and it's a much cleaner way to get into these little devices and yeah and even on the sort of the business and the Enterprise styling product where you can have a public IP address you can request it and they'll assign one for you it's still you know the idea of opening ports on on public IPS it just freaks me out especially in these kind of remote deployment scenarios where you've got devices like a VoIP handset that you wouldn't necessarily in this case think about security updates for or you know necessarily maintained in the same way you would if it was a full Enterprise deployment so I would much rather even when there is public IP addressing use a tool like InTouch because then you're not only have you got user level uh permissions and security about who can do it but you're not increasing your surface area for Attack by having Courts open unnecessarily yeah it's really easy to gloss over the the risks of just opening a web port for a web a web interface on a printer or a phone because you don't know how vulnerable or secure that that device's web interface is right if that's publicly Exposed on the internet there's ways that people maybe maybe able to compromise that device and then all of a sudden now they're in your network because they got into that phone and that phone's on your network where this way there is no exposure right they it's going through in control it's not an inbound Port that they can sit there and probe and and beat on they have to be have a login to your account to be able to see that device so very very different way and you don't have to set up any infrastructure either this is all built in there's no vpns that you have to set up not no extra settings other than what IP address and Port is my phone ad exactly right yeah yeah it's just a an added benefit Beyond protecting those applications it's just that day-to-day how do I keep my stuff working and do what I want to do on top of that that user experience quality um cool well thank you Martin um Peter I think you've got a you're gonna take it another step further and show us kind of a start to finish from scratch configuration I am uh and so what what I have is in my demo is an mbx mini uh with ATT and T-Mobile 5G uh ignore the fancy antenna there and and then outside I have uh we just built this uh for for playing around so I've got my little pneumatic uh antenna mount with my starlink mounted to the top of it um I kept getting these errors I said uh was obstructions detected I'm like the sky's open I don't understand so I figure if I just got it higher than the trees I wouldn't have obstruction detected anymore uh and so I've got my starlink mounted to a pole and then I've got my mbx and I'm I've actually if you notice this device has been online for 29 minutes or 31 minutes I have factory reset the device um I'm holding the power or the ethernet cable for my uh my starlink so I'm going to show configuring this uh from scratch and that way it just allows people to see kind of how we tune things or how I set it up uh for deployment so so here's my mbx mini uh starlink so you can see my T-Mobile My ATT are connected right now and so I'm going to go to uh now if you're I'm running 8.3 firmware um some of the features and Martin has already alluded to this as well but um 8.3 is an rc2 it's going to be GA very very soon and and I know there are some frustrations out there with the bonding performance of starlink and 5G and 4G I I just want to give you some peace of mind I'm going to demo this today that we we know this and we've identified how to make this better and I'm going to show you how to fix that but we are going to be running 8.3 for the demo as well as once it goes GA um and speed Fusion connects speed Fusion protect gets updated to um 8.3 you're going to see improvements here as well um so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to log into my router so I'm gonna go to settings remote web admin and if you've never logged into the router before it's going to ask you to set up a Wi-Fi password um here you can actually set the SSID it doesn't look like you can but it's kind of gray there so I can actually change this to uh starlink webinar and then give it a password and then click save and apply if you're logging in locally to the device you actually will ask you for an admin password as well and so uh just be aware of that so I've logged into the router you can see my T-Mobile and My ATT are there and I have my priorities so by default the router is going to say Wan one and the reason why this is unplugged is because if I plug that in T-Mobile and at T would be disconnected right now because when one would be my starter link and I'd only be connected to starlink um and so this is important here because there's two types of priority you have interface priority in other words is this interface working and then you have bonding or speed Fusion priorities which is the hot failover that that Travis alluded to earlier the interface priority will supersede speed Fusion priorities so if you if the interface is down on here it can't be used in speed fusion um and so I'm going to move my Wan 1 down to Priority two to make it active and that way when I plug into Wan 1 my starlink and my uh 5G will be active so let me go ahead and turn that on Yeah so basically if you'd not done that it would kind of disable the priority two connections and would have turned on right and then I and then I would have lost access to like it would have switched over to the starlink and then in control would have reset me um and it actually still might as a priority went as a part of the win it might still kick over which is one of the cool things about uh speed fusion um and you'll notice this when we get faster here or as we set it up so now I've got my T-Mobile My ATT and my starlink all connected they're all on the internet so now I can set up two I'm gonna set up two different vpns one is speech sfc protect and the other is going to be just a regular speed Fusion demoing some of these uh 8.3 features that we talked about and I'm gonna do the speed Fusion protect really fast because they've already done it so we're gonna go to speed Fusion protect on the client mode so there's two types of modes we have relay mode which is like if you want to relay it through your house so say you have like a a a br2 pro 5G or a mobile RV and you want to use the high speed cable modem at your house for internet you can actually set up relay mode right here or we're going to do client mode which is outbound so I'm going to use the client mode I'm gonna just choose automatic but you could choose the location I think you said that one of these or a couple of these are might be 8.3 already but we're gonna do automatic hit okay automatic it's been connecting me to an eight three node on the other side automatically nice and so once I've choose automatic and I hit okay you're going to see now this sfc shows up so I can click on the sfc and we want to make sure two things one we want to make sure Dynamic weighted bonding is enabled that is very very important the other thing for starlink specifically and um congested LTE networks would be TCP ramp up TCP ramp up is a new feature an 8.3 that's going to improve the handling of TCP traffic which starlink uses TCP acceleration it's super uh it's going to dynamically change how your your upload and download throughput um as the uh speed Fusion protect systems come online so Dynamic weighted bonding and then I can hit save and apply changes and that speed Fusion for now there's we can create subtunnels like land smoothing and Ford air correction but once again it's already been demoed so I'm more going to show some of the differences in tuning uh versus uh versus the actual sub tunnels here and then I'm gonna go to Advanced and I'm going to create a speed Fusion connection to my sdx running 8.3 in my office and this is going to allow me to better showcase some of these 8.3 features as well as some of the the tuning that people might be looking for so I'm going to give my router a local ID oops sorry there we go and then I'm going to create a new profile put in the connection name an appreciared key that free share key will be invalid right after this webinar and then I'm going to put in uh my my URL to my server I'm going to enable Dynamic way to bonding I'm going to enable TCP ramp up now on my sdx in my office I've also set up this tunnel to go to a mobile device called starlink and use TCP ramp up so I'm getting the upload and download capabilities and then I've got Dynamic weighted bonding enabled on both sides so I'm going to have upload and download TCP ramp up enabled as well as Dynamic the new 8.3 Dynamic weighted bonding I'm going to hit save changes and if I go back to my dashboard I just want to jump in quick here yeah one one thing that you know a lot of people wonder about is you know you know you mentioned at the beginning right there's it's not you're not seeing quite the performance you wanted to uh cut bonding starlink and 5G together right um that's hard it turns out right this is really actually really challenging from an engineering perspective to do that and very few companies can do that but more importantly very few companies do that in a way that has actually optimizing for these highly variable networks there's a lot of Enterprise sd-wan Solutions out there that are just predicated around those SLA or at worst those Broadband links that are highly consistent right it's it's more of a failover solution and when you start throwing these highly Dynamic connections like 5G and starlink at these Enterprise sd-wan devices the performance goes way down they're just not designed to accommodate the the link behavior that you're seeing out there on these links and that's what we're doing we We Are Wireless first and every single firmware we are further optimizing and refining how much performance you can get out of these these multi-link combinations and that's I think Peter what you've seen exactly in 8.3 is a huge Improvement there well in Dynamic way to bonding and I mean Martin was alluding to it as well it is dramatically improved the way that we do TCP handling congestion detection um the way that it handles packet loss um as a means of detecting congestion and or latency as a means of detecting congestion so that we're not certainly dumping a whole bunch of data that's failing to to communicate with the you know to to transfer and so the new Dynamic weighted bonding is gonna is really improving uh how data is handled and that's where where we're going to see a bunch of improvements I'm just waiting for this guy to to after all those vpns established there so once again we're doing this live and the reason I'm doing this live too is because it's sometimes you just you have to wait for it to like configure and get its settings and and so you might think oh my gosh it's not working no no it's it's working fine it's Gotta connect and authenticate and get those vpns uh connections going uh and so that needs to be there and obviously my my speed Fusion tone is not connecting so I just wanna I did that really fast I just want to make sure I open it I see what I right there foreign TCB ramp up a couple of times but actually that's uh we should talk about what it is I suppose that's yeah that is actually the the initial duplication of packets to generate more traffic when a session starts to uh to increase the TCP um uh window to enable then subsequent um subsequently more bandwidth to be sent right so on yeah session you see that normally a quite a gentle ramp up um we're kind of forcing out with a TCP ramp up to we have to to ramp much faster very clever it also helps with that TCP acceleration that's being handled by starlink um and so it like they complement each other right we're helping complement those the Technologies uh so that they can there we go now it's now it's created so now that I've got my two tunnels here I'm to make this faster for me I'm going to go ahead and create an outbound policy that tells my router to use um these connections so I'm gonna go to my Advanced tab and that will connect here in a second so I'm gonna pause my screen real fast just log into my sdx make sure I typed all that stuff right I'm so sorry everybody uh let me just make sure I type the oh there it goes connected okay see I just had to wait there we go I was being impatient myself Everything feels so much longer when you're live people are watching and you're like I want it to work um and so so right now feels like right down time just like that it's horrible so the other thing is and a lot of and I don't know Martin and uh Travis if you feel this but a lot of times people connect to speed Fusion connect um or or their VPN and then they're like oh I'm not seeing any Improvement and the reason is is because you don't have those policies set up and so uh Travis and Martin showed you guys how to use those policies I'm going to show you a third way to use the policy and that's outbound policies directly I figured that that would be the best way to do this right we you showed in control Martin showed using uh sfc protect so I'm going to use outbound policies and how outbound policies built into the router are are just or about the exact same as outbound policies and in control with the exception that we don't get Regional based routing and we don't get SAS so if I add a rule and I go to my destination I'm only going to have IP network and domain name I'm not going to have net like SAS applications like teams um those you either have to use sfc protect or you have to use in control to get those databases so if so for me I'm just going to set up a generic policy I want to bond so I'm going to say I like the way you guys are doing that Dynamic bonding Dynamic bonding and then I'm going to Simply say I want all my traffic to go over my my speed Fusion to my office and then back up to speed Fusion protect and the reason I'm doing that is because I have six gigabit internet off my at my office so if if as I'm maneuvering around an infrastructure or moving around the country which I do often in my my Sprinter um I actually want all my traffic to go over over my data set my office and then only if that like if on a power loss or whatever if that's not available to me then I have a backup connection which is the speed Fusion uh protect and once again uh Travis and Martin showed other cases so I'm just showing a different use case so here what I can say is priority use West uh my speed fusion and then secondary use speed Fusion uh protect and then fail through the next Rule and this terminate sessions on recovery will make sure everything is on my bonded the bonded VPN that I want so I'm saying in the event that both of these don't work just just load balance go out whatever you know just use your auto load balancing capabilities that the peplink does but otherwise I want you to send all traffic out out one of these connections I hit save you'll see this show up here and you can fine tune this but once again for the purpose of the video just showing a third way and I can hit apply changes and now all my traffic will be bonded uh to my speed fusion and my office and then if that goes down it will fail over to speed Fusion connect and once that's done we'll let that reset and wait for it to apply the uh it was really funny because you Martin you mentioned you're starting being down today when I was setting up for this demo I I have multiple starlink uh and for whatever reason I couldn't get mine to turn on so right before this webinar like scrambling to grab my uh my other starlink because I couldn't get it to uh it kept saying uh it wouldn't power up and one of my friends uh commented that might not have had the that cable plugged in all the way right but you know even technicians we we do have challenges and I I thought that was an interesting one because I've been using Starling for months now and sure enough right before this webinar uh that my Enterprise starlink wasn't lighting up and I found that to be you know really interesting I yeah I'm I'm looking at my selling whilst you've been doing yours and this this I've got no issues with connection to the styling the solids online it's reporting is online it's a really really interesting fault and it I did a software update just before this webinar on the stock itself and I think that's why that's what's booked it that's what I need to uh I will say with some of my Enterprise customers and I forgot to mention this um we do fine tune so all I did here is I just plugged in the starlink to win one but actually what we do uh when we when we set up starlink uh for production environments is I is I actually go in and I go into this van one and I actually change this to 1500. and then I set my health check interval to 10 seconds instead of 5 Seconds and I do a ping um and I ping my DNS servers or you can set it up to like Ping DNS but they actually recommend the the DNS servers in Sterling this will help mitigate false downtime with uh starlink so setting the MTU the negotiation that that starlink has is uh 1500 on their on their devices and then if we do a ping test with a slightly elongated uh health check interval of 10 seconds instead of five seconds you actually will get more stable you don't get that flapping of up and down that sometimes might occur so if you see that where you flap up and down where it says Starling fails darling connected starlink failed um by changing this to a ping with the health check interval at higher we were actually able to stabilize the the starlink um health check detection I'm going to cancel that because I don't want to reset my mode my connection right now but I did want to add that note so now I've got my um sfc protect and my my speed fusion and I wanted to do this as a final for me just to show the difference between 8.2.1 bonding and 8.3 if that's okay and it is incredibly cloudy outside um here here in Florida right now um we don't we don't really get weather winter weather but we are right now and uh and so my connections might or might not be that great um but but it's a really neat demonstration so I'm going to click the little arrow here I'm gonna put my my speed Fusion connect and I'll see my my way inside I've got a starlink my T-Mobile and My ATT and if I do a download test and hit start you'll see that T-Mobile look at that T-Mobile and ATT just are barely doing anything and you can see Starling kind of carrying the load here and we got some packet loss and you know getting you know 45 46 so it really makes starlink look really good right now um so and not saying it's not for any starlink employees that are on the show but but you know it it looks good that cellular2 connection is having some troubles that latency was going yeah it went through the roof right yep so now let's try with TCP ramp up on 8.3 um with with that same connection so let's see what what that looks like and and so you'll see some packet loss there but but look at look at T-Mobile now and so and it'll start and if you this is a brand new setup but if as we go you'll see see those uh those increase you see starlink is increasing um and if you do you know a long test more than 20 seconds you'll actually see that continue to ramp up if you do like 120 seconds you'll see that starlink ramp up but you see the difference between T-Mobile and starlink I'm actually aggregating 5G and startling together and then the ATT is sitting there just feeding some data right it's you know it's uh it's it's down there just feeding it some extra data but I I find that to be incredibly valuable as an understanding of what's coming here in 8.3 with uh sfc protect and TCP ramp up and things like that and so I just wanted to show that off for a second yeah I think this is really what you just showed is really powerful to me because it demonstrates you're not moving right you're in one spot but those connections moved all over the place yeah yeah they go up and down and yeah so and each one did it at different times and in different manner into different degrees of severity and you didn't change anything you didn't have to do anything different on the router right that's Dynamic way to bonding those that's the difference right our algorithms are designed to react to those those changes quickly and it was fun to see that actually shift shift traffic back and forth too should we uh do a q a yeah I've been going through and punching in answers as I could here um but yeah let's let's dive in there I'm just finishing one more response here all right yeah we're just after the top of the hour here so um that that will be all the demonstration we'll show today but yeah we're gonna dive into the Q a and those who want to stay on great we're gonna keep going and answer some questions there's a there's a guy uh uh a band that asked you know what's the average time to get starlink service and do you know have a way I wish we had a starlink rep on the on the call here with us I've been kind of fun um you know there are there are tricks I'm just going to give you my trick and I don't know if I'm allowed to say this or not but if you buy the RV one you'll get the starlink and then you can upgrade or Transit you can transition that over to um Enterprise or even business or a residential uh and so if you are waiting and you want to play with this now you can buy that RV service and then the same dish can be used for all the different plants um and with the RV one I just ordered my I was trying to waiting for the uh the the Enterprise flat dish I just ordered the RV flat dish and I was able to get that and then I just I can transition that over so now I have the I'll be mounting the flat dish now on my Sprinter van so I'll have four 5G and then I'll have the the Starling flat dish on my Sprinter as of next week um so that you know but but yeah all I can say is if you're on the waiting yeah there is no ETA so maybe look at maybe look at getting uh um the RV one if you can they're building a network with space lasers it's hard for them to keep up with all of this like it really is just a absolute feat of engineering that they've deployed this and have dishes even to give people right now so yeah the wait time is frustrating but I think it's gonna be a miss not to point out that uh there are actually some some stunning resellers out there that might have some stock uh in the in their uh in their warehouse there you go if anyone he was looking for high volume to dishes um there are some interesting things we can speak to just put that that is a Starlight reseller is that is that true or yes we are yeah yeah but it's time yeah um we're focusing on Enterprise of course and uh and yeah doing lots of lots of really interesting work around Enterprise starlink and and 5G in particular of course that's uh there's lots of demand for it so it's uh that's another really unique thing about peplink and starlink is this you know this solution works great for Enterprise and we've seen it be able to go well beyond other Enterprise sqn solutions that couldn't handle as many starlink dishes as the customer wanted and things like that but this is also super relevant for you and me and your mom right I mean it doesn't take a whole ten thousand dollars worth of Kit to make this work right you can do this with the peplink br1 mini I mean you can spend a few hundred dollars and that's not going to give you the 5G side of it but you can get 4G and starlinks so yeah people with much lower budgets than an Enterprise can actually afford this technology to solve their problems so they can you know work like those Enterprises do too really good really valid point you know the as we talk about starlinks and 5G and combining them and it becomes a set of Lego bricks right particularly within pamplings world how we can then take multiples of each multiple operators multiple Technologies multiple dishes and combine them in a way that gives you hardware and Technology redundancy that's that's where this gets really exciting uh I hope you've done a bunch of large-scale kind of dish deployments and it's been really exciting every time we we look at this and we have a customer demand that comes in that says I need this amount of bandwidth in this location it's just a question of adding more links right there's almost all it boils down to you need a bigger share of the available bandwidth from both starting and 5G and to do that you need more connections and that's why this whole peckling styling combination is exciting I see a lot of questions about VoIP and when like when smoothie and FEC and I know in our original conversation we talked about that and if people want to have that conversation I don't mind spending another five minutes on that as well and just kind of answer we could probably knock out like 30 of these questions with the same with the same conversation but when do you land smoothing versus FEC versus bonding and and it's kind of an interesting and I think we all three of us have our own unique take on that as well um you know FEC Ford air correction has really been built for the broadcast industry for one-way audio or one-way video or audio transmission the idea is you're you're trying to to conserve bandwidth so uh uh conserve being with overhead by improve but also improving quality so that is you know if I've got a transmit I'm trying to send a 1080p video stream upload um up to my net up to uh like a you know whatever my my decoder is then FEC allows you to add either 13 or 26 overhead to add parity bits for reduced Jitter and latency and and uh without consuming as much bandwidth and so it gives you a little bit of protection but not the complete protection um when smoothing is a is designed for video conferences like zoom and teams and VOIP and things like that when smoothing adds extra adds a hundred percent 200 or 400 percent redundancy uh for the lowest latency the least amount of Jitter uh and best failover um if you're if you really want to show off the power of a peplink router set up a router with two or more internet connections enable wand smoothing start a VoIP call or a ping test and unplug one of your internet connections it's it's going to be seamless because it's sending redundant parity bits at a hundred percent so if you have two wins one win is is they're both being used equally for for that transmission um if you have it on like if you have three or four lands you can enable you know speed Fusion or land smoothing medium or when smoothing high and have even further uh protection I have 200 protection um I I personally I you know in modern 5G world I I don't recommend that because the latency and packet loss isn't that high in 5G and starlink in this starlink webinar but um but you can do that and so for VoIP and uh teams calls and things like that when smoothing um works that being said and this is where we might all differ I'm all about getting the most bandwidth out of my connection and with dwb and TCP ramp up and the new features of 8.3 I found myself more and more often turning off land smoothing and FEC and letting Dynamic weighted bonding handle that call now that's brand new with 8.3 but I find myself seeing that the benefit of of dwb and DW dwb came out in 8.1.3 uh but it's been improved like 8.1.3 8.2.1 was improved and then um and then 8.3 it's even more improved but I find myself less and less using Wan smoothing now that dwb with five at least with 5G and uh connections like starlink and 5G I find myself not needing it as much and only using it when when there's packet loss like where I'm in a real rural area where I'm seeing lots of packet loss I don't know if Martin and Travis feel about that but that that's sort of what I've started to see and that it's not a one size fits all it's uh and you have to evaluate where you are and what your connection is to make that decision that you can't just say oh well Peter says don't use way and smoothing you might be heavily disappointed if you're in a area with with high packet loss and so um but but it seems to be I'm seeing that with dwb we need to use it less and and at least in my experience so I get more bandwidth and more increased reliability I I don't know how YouTube feel about that at all it it reminds me of the question of like what stock should I invest in it depends right what's your timeline what's what's how much money do you have to invest right like there's a lot of different questions that go into that answer and I think it's the same for which which algorithms best for protecting this or that as well you know do you have two Wireline Broadband links that aren't metered if that's the answer yes then yeah use when smoothing you're not paying for more bandwidth on either one of those links so you know it's kind of free in that sense so yeah let's let's get the free insurance on that but if I've got two 5G links you know maybe I'm paying a lot for those maybe I'm not but on one hand they're more likely to have a problem so I'm motivated to use um you know something like wind smoothing there but on the other hand I'm paying for every gigabit and megabyte that goes through that so you know it depends on how much right it's a very situational and individual I guess uh decision on that but the important part is we have the tools in that kind of ladder of more aggressive mechanisms to protect that traffic right um I I think actually for me it's got a lot easier you know the before 8.3 when we were looking at Performance Tuning when we were looking at solving any sort of issues with connectivity for a customer we have the this Fantastic Tools that we could use we could use bonding we could use land smoothing we've got forward error correction and then with subtotals we could use all of those in different ways with different types of traffic and it was actually uh really empowering to be able to fix issues that referred for specific types of traffic very easily actually right but it was still a manual process you're still having to identify the the you know that you had significant packet loss on a link and that really if you wanted to guarantee the traffic you needed to turn on these features and it was it took a lot of experience to do that well what's amazing with Dynamic related bonding now is that we're we're seeing it apply landsloothing and forward error correction dynamically on links the it no it identifies as having latency and packet loss issues and when I saw that for the first time I my jaw hit the floor right it was I was I was doing a demo to a customer and I said oh you know this is what all the icons mean on Fusion graphs and we haven't shown those yet but you know this is what it is all about and then and I thought well hey where did those weren't so anything where packets come from and where did the Ford error correction packets come from and and then I realized it was being applied dynamically so like you think I'm not my default now is dynamically bonding turn it on turn on TCP ramp up and then sit back and watch and see what happens and that is nearly that's nearly a default config yeah the only times like I I manually go in and enable answer anything is when we're doing something nuts when we're doing something the one of the customers I dealt with in the past was a remotely driven taxis right and they need to guarantee the the command and control signals going from a remote driving station to the vehicle and they need to guarantee elements of the video coming back you don't mess around then you don't leave that Dynamic you just turn on land smoothing for the commander control because you have to make sure it gets through correct yeah that's what that's where that play is really key that lowest latency connection like a spike of high latency is not acceptable and so when smoothing then then creates in we got a really good question and and I'd like to address it Jane James uh asked he said uh I haven't tried sfc uh uh protect um I have a balance one residential one gigabit connection and a starlink on Colt standby which should I purchase uh or should I purchase uh I'm sorry which plan should I purchase to enable sfc uh similar to the way you have demoed and let's talk about that because a gigabit connection is important especially when you're talking about sfc protect fsfc protect at least currently is limited to 200 megabits per second and there are services like Netflix and Hulu that will block because they see that it's coming from a VPN sfc protect and this is my personal opinion so Travis you might want to step in but is designed to protect Mission critical applications teams and VOIP and and uh you know reliable file uploads to Office 365 and things that where that gigabit connection isn't being utilized um uh in its fullest like I don't need a gigabit of connection to have a zoom call I don't need a gigabit connection to have a hundred Zoom calls right uh and well yeah maybe yeah depending on how many video feeds but uh let's say 10 to zoom calls um and so when you're looking at um the sfc protect um you're gonna see uh the need here is protecting business applications that that require that extra level of of reliability and so that's why the traffic shaping policies that Martin and and uh Travis demonstrated in their part of the video was so important because they're saying hey I'm using sfc protect and here's how I I float control the flow of different applications over the different sub tunnels um but in your scenario uh James I would actually I would not have starlink as a cold standby I would use outbound policies to load balance that connection unless the starlink is way underperforming and then which case the starlink and a cold standby is a good good idea I mean some some areas right I mean I've seen Starling get 20 Megs of throughput and I've seen it get 200 and 300 you know you know and even 400 Megs of throughput and so making sure that we that you know you evaluate that need but you don't you don't want to bond that together for all of your internet you only want to bond that together for your mission critical data and so that's where I'd mentioned in my video how you can the WAN connection status you can put starlink in priority in in the same always on use sfc protect to bond with land smoothing your um your business applications that way you have seamless failover with with business applications for your cable modem and then um and then in the event that your cable unveils you don't drop your Zoom call your team's call anything like that and then in your and then the rest of your traffic uses you so your default would be use that one giga connection and then only fail over to starlink when that when the the that one gigabit connection fails so that way you're able to seamlessly fail over your HT you know your regular web browsing traffic but at the same time yours your teams and zoom calls and VOIP calls and things like that get to take advantage of the WAN smoothing capabilities of starlink and your cable modem I mean that would be my and I think I mean that's exactly how Travis had it set up in his demo so after this video rewind and watch what Travis did because that's exactly what you would want to do is how traffic has it set up right I definitely agree that the new algorithms are so much more efficient and so much easier to use just so much less fine-tuning that that is the right default um for sure that's the easiest default I guess or the most reliable default um somebody else asked a question that was sfc protect versus speed Fusion connect um I just want to state that there's a branding uh update there which even me what talking online I kept saying speed Fusion connect and speed Fusion protect and sfc protect um peplink as they built out the speed Fusion platform um the Technologies and features of it uh changed and so uh 8.3 firmware will give you sfc protect however 8.2.1 has the same capabilities the land smoothing so your br1 pro 5G if you have a cable modem and 5G you can go into speed Fusion connect and still add enable land smoothing just like we showed you in sfc protect it it's the same uh just the naming is is is adapting to the the breadth of Technology that's being added to this service I just want to show something I don't know so I've got two connections at my at my side and at this point you know my starlink is not deployed in an ideal scenario my my building is a small one in between two big ones so I am obstructed so you know this isn't starling's fault but my connection isn't 100 as reliable as it is it not as a normal starlink or an unobstructed Starling connection would be and then my backup connection is my my 5G which is another shared kind of right to use type of network so I've got two right to use networks now when they're both active they pretty much back each other up pretty well but you know each one of them can have a problem at the same time and that's where you have to start thinking more critically about you know what am I doing how important is what I'm doing and um you know how do I actually when I do get into that failover state then what's my connection quality like right if I lose my Wireline and I fail over to this backup is my backup good enough to perform the way that I want it to and you know sometimes that answer will be no you need two 5gs or two star links or both um and so you know like you guys said every situation might be a little bit different and you might actually step into some territory where you need another link to actually give you that quality of experience that you know two connections just weren't able to right we speed Fusion can't make bandwidth just appear right we have to use what we're given from these different networks at any given time and so sometimes you just need more chances to have a good connection and depending on where your location's at I think I can show that connection instability here right now if we want to look a couple of questions here around um uh whether to use the starlink router or not how will we connecting to the starlink uh I personally I I always get rid of the stunning rooster and I just plug direct wired connection into the into the path link I just I don't like anything else in between I totally agree yeah I mean I love these graphs so much you know when we see it would the amount of times people saying I've got a great connection great 5G connection all right I've got a great settling connection and uh you know why why can't I use all of it all of the bandwidth on it all of the time so like you don't necessarily have a really good IG connection right you've got a connection that's with packet loss and and Jitter and you've got you you might be able to run a speed test and ignore the fact that speed test takes you to high latency and and there's effectively ignoring the packet loss to a certain extent also uh for you through buffers to give you a result but if you want to do anything useful with the bandwidth if you want to have a reliable connection at all you somehow need to mitigate and packet loss an agency right and this this as a visual is is always really useful to explain that I think yeah and in my case I need more links right these two are just not reliable enough in their currently deployed manner to give me the bulletproof connectivity that I may want and for some people this gives them more than they want right some people this is great but yeah it's just again you have to take what's available out there in terms of different connections and providers and combine those creatively to to get to where where your connectivity needs to be and when you add those the the extra connections and you see on this grass refusion um diamonds you've only kicking in and using you know another link for upload um traffic and uh and and duplicating packets and the foot turning on Forward Air Corrections it's just wonderful to see it kind of do its thing and settle down and and then you you put your mouse cursor on the links individually you see you've got a certain amount of pack of loss and latency and then you see the result the overall statistics of the tunnel and how it's been improved it's just yeah that's where the magic happens for me I think we can wrap this up for today I just really appreciate everybody taking their time Martin Peter thank you so much for taking your time to present to us all here um anybody who registered for the webinar will get a recording emailed out it will also go on our user forums so uh stay tuned for those thanks again folks have a great day thank you Merry Christmas thank you everyone yeah Merry Christmas goodbye"}

think everybody knows Peter pretty well but um today we're kicking off something pretty awesome we're gonna we're starting a new webinar series Peter really pushed to Champion this uh peplink University webinar Series so we're going to train you on all kinds of different things show you exactly how to do how to implement different different features different strategies with peplink but it's all about Hands-On and so really with that I'm going to hand it over to Peter and thanks so much Peter for kicking this off with us foreign it's my pleasure thank you for having me I I hope I would meant to be in my uh nice comfy office today with good writing and things like that so I hope everything uh sounds okay and uh goes well I'm sitting in a Best Buy parking lot in uh in Alabama so so we'll see how this goes I'm really excited to to start this series as public university Series where we go deep dive into how different Technologies within the peplink ecosystem work um and we're going to kick this off with the virtual Wan activation license um and and the reason why we're going to do this is because my understanding how the v-wan or VLAN is wan uh worked is very different than how peplink engineered it and I thought it was amazing the way that they made this so simple and so we're going to talk a little bit about that uh today and then I've I am actually like I said I'm in a parking lot um I'm gonna turn my camera around uh so I've got my my 20x uh set up here right there and then I've got two star links I don't know if you can see them with the white wash of the the background but I got two starlings right there I've got my new flat dish and then my RV starlink and and the goal of the today is to make both of those starlinks work on my 20x and so that's what I want to do now for for all for everybody that I am powering this via an hd4 5G so that way I can reboot the router and play with it and still Stream So I do have a backup internet connection while I mess around with all the cables because I'm going to show this to you as a factory reset balance 20x so there you go to today's one we're going to Deep dive into peplink Concepts and deliver a live demonstration of the the WAN activation feature um a little bit about the 20x if you don't already know but I'm gonna do this from memory so Travis if you want to correct me if I make a mistake but uh 900 megabits per second router single ethernet Wan built-in category seven LTE modem and then it has a flex module mini that supports up to a 5G uh Flex module modal uh and so that gives us the ability to have three internet connections very very easily peplink has now added this vwan license which we'll talk about here so the the virtual win activation license allows you to actually VLAN tag a lan Port of the 20x and make it a Wan Port so it's not the same as the Old Port configuration capability where you could tag or say use this interface this physical interface as a Wan Port this allows us to actually take the Lan and trunk or add a um VLAN to your network or to the router and this is really cool on the 20x but I'd love to talk about a little bit more on the Enterprise side because that is where I mostly Focus a lot of times when you're deploying these networks the outdoor connectivity like the 5G Dome or Star leak or something like that might be far away further than the cable the like like an RF cable might go the VLAN or the vwan as LAN VLAN is when feature allows us to trunk a VLAN throughout an existing infrastructure and extend that physical work that interface and that's the most important thing about this so the idea is that we can extend or or enhance add more lands so the vwan activation license on the 20x allows you to add three additional virtual Lan interfaces uh to the router and so I'm going to demonstrate exactly how to do that as well so in in our scenario you can have for example like a star link in a cable modem because I am remote we're going to do two starlings um and so that is going to be the big difference and then we're going to have our uh LTE and category seven and then additionally I have the 5G modem and so we'll talk about that as well the virtual land activation license allows you to create one virtual Wan on a particular VLAN or a physical interface which is like I mentioned earlier uh this means you can create virtual Wan on a VLAN for a Wan port or a Wan on a lan Port that is really confusing I I think what's important is that we can extend our wans over a VLAN and that like I said on a physical small device is not as uh impressive but when you're talking about extending this several thousand feet or outside of a building to a switch it's really it's really cool technology the ability to do that and then with the 20x like I said being able to just tag that on your uh your interfaces when I first thought about this design what go ahead obviously in a lot of ways it's almost like you get a free ethernet port because you might yeah it's probably gonna be trunk land traffic on that Port already anyways right so it's not consuming another port for this purpose it's is not dedicated Port that's exactly what I was going to say is you can trunk this right into a switch like I demonstrated that at the uh peplink Tech Summit where we had eight HD1 domes going into an uh 48 Port switch that was being also used for land for APS on the land and then trunking into a single 10 gig fiber port on an epx and so the that this capability is adds not just Wan ports but but flexibility for deployment uh and it's it's absolutely amazing uh and then like and I already and already talked about this I apologize I skipped ahead on the slides it's just that excitement but is this the same as awana's land and and it's not because we're not dedicating that physical port to a a Wan interface we're trunking it and so the idea of that if if you don't know is that we can um in my original design original thought process like I said I'd go up to a switch port on another switch and that way I could scale the infrastructure out uh more easily and so my original thought process I was going to demonstrate this video was actually to have a another switch like a peplink switch eight Port switch plug the two star links into that and then have that trunk down into uh the 20x uh so but this demonstration we're gonna just use it uh and we're gonna do a live demonstration of this so as I mentioned I have the 20x router and so it needs to be on in control so here's my peplink University uh in control organization and I'm pretty proud of this I got my little logo in the corner and stuff this way we can do demonstrations without that are dedicated to uh specifically peplink University so in order to activate the vwan feature you have to have the router in in control and on Prime Care the Prime Care license gives us that vwan uh virtual Wan activation license so if I click show all right here I'm actually going to be able to scroll down to my oops sorry I apologize feature activation show I can then see my activation licenses so you can see speed Fusion Cloud activation standard warranty then I got a little bit of 5G LTE service on my categories of speed Fusion connect 5G I think uh I've got some gigabytes there I don't know what plan a is do you know yeah I don't know what size that is okay yeah so I got I got a speed Fusion connect LTE that means there's no SIM card in my 20x it's actually connected and you can see right here on the right hand side it's really cool speed Fusion connect LTE is active versus in my 5G module I have a SIM slot in slot a then you can see right down here the very last one virtual Wan activation license so if that is not being pushed out to your router this functionality will not work so it's really important that the router is in control connected to your Wan or your cellular uh and and then gets that license that virtual Wan activation license and then you can see here a pep Flex module so you can see my pep uh my Flex module mini is is then connected as well so this is once again a factory reset router so I went to one night um I plugged into the router I'm ethernet connected that way I can be on the Wi-Fi and ethernet at the same time and it's gonna first thing it's going to do is ask me to put in a password so I'm going to go ahead and put in a password so I can log in so the default admin password for the pep link is admin admin and then I got to set a new password so I'm gonna go and do that real fast didn't apply um the other thing is is um I believe you need to have 8.3 firmware uh so if you don't have 8.3 firmware once again you can use in control and push that firmware um I will show you how to do that you just go to settings firmware management now uh 8.3 is currently in beta so it's not going to show in the drop down you have to check this box show beta firmware agree to the terms of beta and then I can then click 8.3 immediately and then I can push that out to the router so you do want to push out the 8.3 firmware uh before you try the vwan uh actually on the 20x it's supported on 821 right it's only on the epx and sdx that you need 8.3 it was supported on there but I can't remember if there's a feature activation or I can't remember exactly how that I think there was still something you needed to do is I recommend being on 8.3 um all my testing for that has worked really well okay there's tons of fun stuff in A3 to play with anyways so there is there's a lot of fun 8.3 I've got a whole video series I'm creating just on 83. so here I can set my SSID so I can say uh uh vwan 20x and give myself a password once again uh the new security protocols with uh peplink it's going to make sure that you're not launching these routers with default admin username password and default Wi-Fi username and password so I can I can set my Wi-Fi right there hit save and apply and hit OK and now you're going to see that I have my Wan connected so this is connected to my uh my little star link my old RV star link and I've got my my Verizon LTE and then I've got my T-Mobile LTE as this hot spare so I can actually drag this up right here and make it active so now I've got Verizon T-Mobile and starlink but I want to add another starlink so what I want to do is configure VLAN as Wan 1. right down here you said V3 VLAN is when one if you you can activate up to three vlan's land so you'd have one two and three if you wanted to so I'm just gonna click on the VLAN as when I'm gonna name this flat starlink I'm going to turn that on and then right here see Uplink interface I can say Wan or Lan so if I if I'm trunking this on the Wan now this is how I used to do it with my Enterprise stuff I could give it a VLAN like 1201 for example now I could Uplink to a switch on my single Wan interface and have both of those Lance one untagged and the other one VLAN 1201 and it's gonna automatically allow trunk VLAN 1201 up that that Wan port or if I want to extend this out my Lan I can say Lan 1201 what this is going to do is reserve VLAN 1201 as a as a blocked VLAN on my on my LAN and then trunk that my on my Lan ports and this is what's really cool so I can trunk that through my Lan infrastructure uh through other switches and things like that to it to an ethernet port that's tagged 1201 so I can hit save and apply and there I have my flat Starling so I can go to the network tab now and I can go to my port settings and Lan Port one I'm going to make my starlink Uplink Port so I'm going to click this little edit button take it type in flat starlink and I can change this to an access port on 1201. and you see that reserved VLAN 1201 so what I've done is I've created a VLAN in my that vwan interface and I said hey that's going to be 1201. then I said apply that to my Lan Network that way I can trunk that or access port that on one of my physical interfaces on the router this does not have to be a physical interface on this router it could be a trunk Port going to another peplink switch or any other switch that's then acts then tagging that as VLAN 1201 so this can go through your network on the Lan so but for this purpose I'm going to take uh Lan one I'm going to set it as an access port 1201 if you don't know what access and trunk means trunk means that I'm going to take a tag a VLAN tag and I'm going to allow it in this port so I'm going to leave the tag as it comes in the port it's going to stay 1201. an access port says untag the network in other words I the starlink doesn't know what 1201 is so untagged traffic as it enters Lan one Lan Port one it's gonna add the tag 1201. once it does that the peplink router is listening on 1201 for that enter for that traffic and so then it's going to receive that as a Wan Port so I'm basically adding the tag 1201 to the Lan Port so that the router knows that that's VLAN 1201 does that make sense was that Travis is a listener did that make sense it does and yeah if you know vlans are a whole concept and it is there's some Foundation but spot on man thank you okay and then so I'm going to hit save and then apply changes and what's also cool I'll show you here too if I go to the network settings where I can configure vlans oop give it one second there we go network settings Reserve 1201 there it is okay so you see right there reserved VLAN 1201 that's my Wan and then used by look at that flat starlink My Lan Port so now I'm gonna have to this miter might not work and I apologize everybody so I've got my so I got my Ethernet cable so now I'm going to plug this in to Lan My Lan Port one right there so I've plugged it into my Lan one right there and so my starlink is on my one starlink is on the WAN and then that white cable is My Lan one and the black cable is my laptop plugged in there we go so now if I go back to my dashboard there you go you can see I'm connected to both starlinks T-Mobile and Verizon and um and that's how you activate VLAN as Wan now we could we do have a lot of time here so I could set up speed Fusion we want to demo speed Fusion protect on 8.3 real fast yeah let's go okay so so now now that we've activated that VLAN that that extra Starling now we need to use it right we need to tell this router hey I've got these four internet connections let's use them so I can go to speedfusion connect protect which is their new bonding Service uh that used to be speed Fusion cloud and then speed Fusion connect and now it's speed Fusion connect protect because they have the LTE service that you can now activate as E7 so then I'm going to go to speed Fusion connect protect and then I'm going to be client mode so we have relay mode which allows you to connect this back to your your home network and then client mode which allows me to connect to peplink's uh public service so I'm going to click client node mode click automatic and then I always click the green check box and then I'm going to click on speed Fusion connect right here and I just want to make sure Dynamic weighted bonding is turned on now because we're using starlink I'm also going to turn on TCP ramp up and if you notice when I turn this on when smoothing turns off TCP ramp up helps us handle TCP acceleration better as well as handles packet loss differently so instead of treating packet loss as a congestion it's going to treat packet loss as basically a like TCP accelerated um so so diff packets that are handled differently from TCP um so TCP ramp up is going to help improve the throughput of starlink and uh packet loss uh LTE works really well with that too if it's not being congested but it turns off land smoothie it's an alternative solution so I'm going to hit save and then apply changes which is underneath that box apply changes and then on my dashboard we'll see speed Fusion connect show up and if you haven't played with the 8.3 firmware it's really fun there's a lot of a lot of changes the the data sheet or the uh changelog uh release data is is absolutely insane with so many different features and improvements uh cellular uh reliability uh connectivity reliability uh Dynamic weighted bonding has a new Dynamic weighted bonding algorithm so there's a bunch of improvements on um 8.3 but it is still in beta so I I highly recommend using it in a testing environment not a production environment at this stage and there you go so my speed Fusion cloud is connected and so now we can just create an outbound policy to utilize speed Fusion Cloud so I go to Advanced and outbound policy add a rule speed Fusion connect uh protect and then I can just say any any priority oop priority speed Fusion Cloud now a lot of times I get asked this and you'll see this in my videos or if you are one of uh one of my customers that I've deployed this on you'll notice I use priority speed Fusion connect protect or priority your VPN instead of enforced and the reason I do this is um in the event that that speed Fusion connect service isn't available or that VPN isn't available I want the router to fail back over to just load balancing so I created a default rule that says hey use speedfusion connect as my primary internet however if for whatever reason that is not working or the router is booting up and it hasn't established um go ahead and fail through to the next rule which is Auto and then terminate sessions on recovery so in other words make sure this router is any traffic going over this gets moved over to speed Fusion connect uh protect hit save and now you can see I'm having outbound policy it does that and then once you have that now I've got two star links a category seven uh T-mobile and a 5G Verizon all bonding to speed Fusion connect and then I've got an outbound policy that uses this just last week I had a customer that was complaining about their throughput of their peplink router and we realized we they had everything set up the speed Fusion connect was set up and everything like that but they forgot the outbound policy to connect to tell that traffic to use it because you got to remember peplink is a traffic shaping or sd-wan which means we have to tell it what to do it's not like you're plugging a cable modem with a single internet connection and just all the traffic goes out that internet connection and so it's important that we tell the router how to use the different internet connections because if you think about it we have five internet connections now right we have one starlink one cellular one cellular2 starlink two and speed Fusion connect protect so that means there's five different paths that traffic can take to get to the internet and so peplink one of the coolest things about peplink which is also probably one of the most confusing is making sure that the pep link is actually routing that traffic properly um so now you can see that I'm connected I've got my outbound policy set up if I go to status and speed Fusion VPN you can see that all of them are connected and being utilized um and the connections are online so I I don't know if anybody has any questions or uh Travis if you want to filter questions let's see when when will 8.3 be out of beta I would assume a couple weeks um I know it's an RC right now we did just report a bug this morning with some open VPN stuff so it um Travis do you have any additional feedback I mean I would assume a couple weeks but I don't know if there's a I've answered those questions in the chat that's basically um we're gonna have one more RFC this year I think and then probably GA right at the beginning of the year but I'm not on the dev team so I can't promise things for this um it does look like you know we're just so close we're really really close yeah I'm gonna put it under the tree I think we'll get a another RC to play with over Christmas and then I think there's going to be another RC because once again I've found a few uh bugs uh and so I think we're gonna have to get one more RC to to make sure all those get cleaned out um 8.3 appears to include VLAN Wan for most pebling routers do you need yes you do um and I think if you guys are interested in seeing that if if my home router or my lab is set up give me one second peplink University epx synergy so this is my my lab infrastructure um and so this is my it's an epx with 48 Port switches so if I go into my epx um you'll see my my T-Mobile 5G is carrying the load here because uh my domes are down they're probably mounting them on a pole right now um and then if I hit show feature activation you'll see I've got two v-wan activation licenses so you can activate the v-wan activation on other routers like the sdx and the epx I don't know about uh Travis do you know if it's available for the balance series outside of the the X Series for the VLAN feature yeah like we'll work on a 710 think it will but I'm actually not I haven't tried it I've only tried it on a 2500 EC uh a sdx pro an sdx and an epx and now the 20x those are the ones I've tested I just don't know if it's available like on a 305 or a 380 or um so I'll let Travis uh figure that one out uh how's the throughput for the vwan interface does it allow native Wan interface uh so it's going to be the same Max routing capacity of the 900 megabits so it's not going to change that but it will be restricted based on the the Uplink of the land so that is a one gigabit Lan so it's not going to increase you to two gigabits like because you have two gigabit interfaces uh the routing capacity is going to be based on the router that you have so the 20x is 900 megabits um and then and then uh I don't know that 20x speed Fusion uh off the top of my head uh is it like 100 I think it's 100 100 or 150 for Speed fusion um bonding uh and then uh so you will still be limited by that um and then 8.3 do you need extra wind we answered that um can you show some speed tests so I can show some speed tests um I just don't want to be the Baseline uh for any sort of disappointment uh because I just set up this so if you'd like to see I can demo the so once again so when when and starlink are my starlinks and my cellular so I've got a category seven and a starting now I don't know the speed Fusion connect protect is it on a point does it support 8.3 dwb yet Travis do you know that won't go until ga I mean okay so we won't be able to demo bonding to using the new dwb but if you wanted to test it or see the throughput I could click the little arrow here um and then do a download test and hit start and then you'll be able to see the capacity of the different modems um as it goes but you saw I don't know if you saw that though the WAN boosted up really high then started to go lower because we're not able to take advantage of the new dwb um so but you can see my uh my one star link is getting decent throughput the other starlink is not getting that great of his throughput and then you can solve it's all the two cellulars so um but that's because we don't have TCP acceleration on speed Fusion connect yet and we don't have dwb the new dwb um so if I were bonding this back to my office my office sdx that has a um 8.3 beta as well then we could take advantage of TCP ramp up and the new dwb but there you go any other questions let's see can you run an upload test sure so once again I can run the test but it this is going to be non-dwb so it's not showing off the new functionality of uh 8.3 so I just want to set that Baseline before I run an upload test what what kind of throughput improvements are you seeing on 83 with the dwb Peter just for for people yeah so my 8.3 yeah my 8.3 uh bonding capacity uh what I'm seeing we're seeing anywhere from 4 to 10x we actually saw our very first 10x bonding Improvement um with uh 10 5G modems which was impressive we went from eight to one uh I'm sorry from eight two zero to eight three with dwb and TCP ramp up and we had a 10x Improvement now I will say that 50 Megs on on a 20x isn't bad um so uh once again I I we'd have to Google the or peplink the the I don't know what the throughput limitations of the 20xr for bonding but um I mean you could see how Verizon was able to give us really good throughput and then the starlinks and the T-Mobile kind of carried a little extra balancing load there if that makes sense and answer live done for the bounce 20x does the pp OE service also reach that um I don't know if I ppoe is just a author authentication method authentication method so it's really gonna be about the provider not the pep link so it's not the ppoe is just authentication on a network and so any sort of limitations on ppoe would be based on the carrier not the pebbling the pebling can route 900 megabits of throughput that's what that's saying so uh depending on the Uplink of that ppoe service right right Travis I mean that's just ppoe is authentication yeah I don't know if there was I don't know what they're I guess I don't know what the significance of PPE OE is on the throughput but um yeah it's just an authentication layer just just like yeah yeah it's but usually associated like DSL or something else and therefore um different in the aspect of of I mean because we have like a module that supports DSL the flex mini module that supports DSL so um any other questions I think that's all the questions um if there's any more I think we're gonna be publishing this live and what once again the idea here of this University series and I do apologize for the roughness of this one especially being the first but is to actually show how to use the technology um like actually how to turn it on for in detail and so that's that's what we want to start doing um and as 8.3 comes out we're going to be starting to launch some more of these 8.3 related features as well um and if there's no other questions then thank you I'll leave that I don't think there's any more awesome well thank you so much Peter Peter's volunteering his time to teach you all how to use these features and so majorly appreciated Peter awesome job and uh you know yeah you're outside you're live but it's real right you're doing it for real in the real world and so I I love it man thank you and it's a lot it's a lot of fun yeah and and thank you everybody for jumping on this and and I hope you got another question one second uh sorry just be clear can you confirm Prime clear Prime Care does include a single VLAN vlan's land license for the 20x specifically for the 20x um so uh PrimeCare will enable a single that's why if you notice mine uh my router has uh PrimeCare and it's on in control and I have the the license but I only have one which is the one that comes free with PrimeCare right right Travis cracks yep it includes one and then I believe you can buy additional V buy two more yeah but it basically working on other oh awesome then that's peplink uh enabling that for others so yeah I paste it in the chat I I can't for some reason respond to the questions that were answered live but in the chat I pasted the entire list of models it's basically every model I mean if you've never everything like it's like what is it every is it only Prime Care related routers then well yeah I'm not sure you know the features supported on all of them I'm not sure you know it should just be any active care plan that would get that feature but I'm not positive on that I don't know what mechanisms well we will when I do my 8.3 follow-up um I will I will validate that and check for you uh Doug um because yeah you're right I so my understanding was that the it was Prime Care enabled but if it's essential care then that's that's awesome because that opens up to more more routers that can use this functionality yeah I think the main thing the other thing is you know don't be surprised if it's working because we auto push those licenses too like if you're thinking you got some loophole check that list like Peter showed we pushed those lights licenses automatically if your devices are online yeah as you've got the firmware that's ready for that license then you're gonna get that the VR2 and the br1 are PrimeCare devices so it'd be neat to see a non-prime care device with 8.3 to see if that that pushes out um yeah so I'm not sure where that one lands but technically it's capable and yeah yeah that'd be kind of cool if uh we'll have to like say well I'll dig into the essential care I know that it's being put allowed for Prime Care so so well uh I hope this information was valuable and uh once again I apologize for being on the road but uh hopefully the the guide still worked and that we learned something so have a have a great day thank you Peter bye"}

"hey folks thanks again for joining we're gonna play a quick video here for peplink one of our biggest driving things behind our culture is Passion that that's you know anytime we bring somebody onto the team we gotta find a passion in their lives we've got to find that that spark that makes them kind of light up and really push harder than than people normally do and that's something we look for in our partners our employees and again that's just something that really drives our company so here's a short little video to show that in action what does pebbling passion look like in practice let's take a look [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign big thanks to everyone who helped to make this possible [Music] alright folks thanks again for joining I'm Travis for those of you that have been on our webinars before I'm showing my face for the first time as the cameras on webinar so hi I think we got a lot of new people here today though there are over 600 people on the line today I think that's probably a record for the start of a show for Pep Boys so thanks so much for joining everybody is obviously very interested to hear about peplink and starlink uh we got a lot of guests today and you know really for peplink our whole goal is we want to make it always work and it is whatever it is that's important to you or your customers and so in this case you know people want to work remotely they want to go to fun places and do fun things and you know maintain their their lifestyle and be able to work and do the things that they used to do at home out in these awesome new places and so that's really what I think a lot of people are intrigued by when they hear about starlink and what those capabilities could do for them I think a lot of people think that that is the the key in the ticket to enabling that that mobile lifestyle for them and so we're going to dig into that today we've got five different guests that have utilized starlink and peplink in different combinations in different Industries and so we're going to show people in a you know in a personal context how you can use starlink um but also in a business context um there's lots of different ways that people are using starlink to support lots of different applications and so again we've got people that are out there on the bleeding edge doing this every day they've been doing it for over a year some of these people and you know starlink for most people hasn't been available for over a year so we've got some absolute experts to talk to you folks today about what starlink is how it's working for them how they're using it and how pebbling fits into that why they have peplink with the starlink system that they've been using for all these cool connections so you know I know there's lots of questions out there um we've got you guys did an awesome job you guys submitted tons of questions for us before this webinar and I know we won't be able to cover all of those on the webinar and there will be lots of burning questions that people still want to know the answer to after this webinar is done we'll try and cover as much as we can online but we're going to make an effort to just file all the all those questions that you folks submit and we'll have a follow-up document to try and address as many of those questions that we don't get to answer during the live stream so that'll be a follow-up material that we're going to send out afterwards and so we're going to just try and keep uh keep you guys informed and keep as many of those questions top of mind and make sure that you're getting the right answers to those so that you can figure out how to solve the problems that you're you're trying to solve I know a lot of the questions out there is you know the thing that we heard the first from the very get-go of starlink is there's just kind of you know at least from our partners there's some folks kind of like thought starlink would be a threat to them like starlink would suddenly eliminate the need for a pep link now that now that you've got the starlink you can go out in the woods and you can get connected anywhere and you don't really need any help anymore and I think what you'll hear today from our panelists is that's just not quite the case it's awesome technology it enables all kinds of new things but there's some gaps there and there's some problems there still and so that's really where pebbling fits in um but you know if if there is a need for that how do we use it what's the best way to use peplink for for combining starlink or or in enhancing starlink how do we use speed fusion and bandwidth bonding just how do I configure this and so we'll dig into some of these best practices tips and tricks and configurations and just you know other kind of I I'd say there's a lot of surprising details that I've learned already and just preparing for this webinar and talking to our panelists and so I'm going to just introduce all of our panelists here I I could talk all day about this but these folks have been doing this way more than myself and so uh we've got five guests like I said from different different Industries different aspects of connectivity now we've got ozon he is from the UK ozone uh why don't you just say hi everyone tell us who you are what company you're with and just a real quick background on them hey everybody uh it's my name is uh otherwise known as Aussie I'm from a chemical simply Wi-Fi uh I am here in the UK we specialize in the use of applicants for the evidence exhibitions and conferences sector okay excellent also with us we've got Eric Eric Johnson from type one or type X sorry hey guys yeah uh I'm Eric with Type X uh we're all about digitizing energy at the source so we deploy in Mobile Data Centers uh in oil fields and essentially we attach our generators to flare gas and just capture that energy so starlink has been a game changer for us because most of our sites are completely 100 remote that's awesome I can't wait to dig into that that sounds really interesting Steve Mitchell we've got with us from cbitz Steve why don't you say hi to everybody yeah hi there my name is Steve Mitchell uh I live on a boat and my customers and clients are all on boats as well so starlink has been a game changer for us because Senator works when you have side of land um you know starlink has enabled us to be out even further and in deeper places and has really allowed so many more people to work remotely and to uh take really great vacations while they are also streaming all sorts of fun Netflix shows so really interested in telling you about our experiences with starlink and peplink as well you can't get behind that's not acceptable you got to keep up when you're on no binge watching at anchor is important in the middle of nowhere awesome uh we've got another Eric with us Eric McCully he is the owner of mobile must have Eric why don't you say hello hey folks Eric with mobilemustave.com um I live in an in a in an RV so a uh a land yacht as it were that uh large Class A motorhome that was in the passion video is my home uh we specialize in providing mobile connectivity um for for mobile users um that that primarily is in the RV and Van life space um and we're very excited to share our experiences as well we have a peplink starlink solution that's been on our RV for over a year it's probably on its second or third generation at this point so we've done a lot of tweaking and excited to tell you guys about it great and last but not least we have Tyler Blackwell from RDH partners Tyler say hi and tell us what RDH Partners does please hello everyone uh Tyler Blackwell here with RDH on Atlanta Georgia our division sellers Communications Works primarily with the film and television industry uh broadcast industry we use a combination of both cellular as well as now starlink uh to allow our customers to communicate at the edge uh any everything from video remote video collaboration uh to remote server access to their data centers so very very complex deployments all the way up down to simple deployments but starlink has been a great backbone to adding on to the capabilities that peplink and cellular has given us over the last couple years awesome well thank you everyone thanks so much for taking the time to join us and tell your stories today again we just want to tell real stories from the field and and let people understand where the problems are and how they can solve those problems and so we're going to dig deeper into each one of your guys's stories in a minute here and let people just really understand what it is that you're doing and how you're solving these problems um again I think we've got a really good variety of topics and use cases here between the different industries that all of you folks participate in so I think it'll be really an interesting show for everybody here that's on um before we dive into all those case studies I'm just going to give you just a quick background here when when we're talking about starlink uh for those of you that don't know starlink is a satellite Technologies brand new satellite technology you know satellites have been around for forever but um starlink is a new way to use satellites they're called Low Earth orbit and so it's faster it's closer to the ground and so latency is much better and so it brings a lot of like wire line properties to a satellite connection that really you know previously had really low really long latency relief uh slow latency and kind of presented some challenges for a lot of different reasons but in any case when you're out on the go there's lots of different ways that you can get connectivity um you know it could be as simple as a hot spot a Wi-Fi hotspot right if you're a camper and you're at an RV park most of those have some sort of our Wi-Fi hotspot system some sort of Wi-Fi mesh system Maybe um they may be free they may be paid if you're at a marina again those often have these these Wi-Fi systems and they're okay right I mean you might be able to get on and check your email and you might be able to get on and do everything that you need to do there's just a huge range of quality and user experience on those types of Wi-Fi systems but I think for the most part people's experiences they're pretty overloaded they're not that fast they're not that reliable and so again they're great for oh I need to check this thing real quick but they're not good for doing work almost ever and usually not even sustainable for keeping yourselves entertained for too long so they're there but often not a very reliable option on the other side we've got 5G or LTE this is available in a lot of places of course it's not available everywhere though as you folks that go out into the outskirts no signal can drop off pretty quick when you get into some of the more enjoyable areas out in the country and so again it's hard to find the right carrier you know there's T-Mobile there's 18 T and there's Verizon in the U.S pick your country you've probably got one to three options to choose from in terms of providers and they've each got their own coverage Footprints and their own gaps and so you know this weekend you may be well served by your favorite carrier but next weekend at a new location you may not be and so that just presents challenges As you move around as in terms of how many different carriers do I need to subscribe to you know with peplink we make it easy to combine all those connections but you still have to go and Source all those connections and so that's challenging but you know we've been bringing things like speed Fusion connect to try and make that easier for people but again all of these technologies have their limits and you know you folks push these Technologies to their limits more than most people do and so you know that's really where starlink comes in starlink isn't limited by the footprint of a tower on the ground it can shoot that coverage down from space and cover much wider areas much bigger geographies and with the new low earth orbit technology and other Technologies they're able to do this at um Broadband speeds where before satellites were just you know kind of inherently slower for the most part so again there's tons of new possibilities here but um you know there's drawbacks again coverage is always a guess on the 5G and cellular side Wi-Fi gets bogged down pretty quick and with starlink there's problems there too you need Clear Sight To The Sky um if you're in an area you know it's not just as simple as looking straight up and finding that little hole in the trees you need a really wide aperture to the sky to keep that connection as reliable as possible because with Starlight the satellites are moving constantly there's just a whole swarm of these satellites that are moving by and floating by you and that's what provides you that coverage is it just a temporary pass by that whatever satellites above you at that moment so you're not looking at just one spot or another spot it's constantly moving and so the less view of the sky you have your uptime is going to go down proportionally so if you've got just a limited view of the sky you're not going to stay connected very long you're going to have a lot of disconnects if you've got a wide open view of the sky you're pretty much going to stay connected all the time there's still times I think where folks out there will experience those gaps if if the satellites aren't quite covering uh seamlessly but again if you don't have that that visibility to the sky you really don't have much to work with at all and so our viewers especially are finding that there's a you know people like shade when they're in hot sun and things like that and that's not necessarily compatible with where you want your starlink dish to be so there's lots of considerations there speeds can be limited on these Mobile plans we'll get into a lot more details on some of these kind of Hang-Ups with Starlight but again it's great technology it's awesome it's amazing but it's just not perfect and none of these Technologies are and peplink is here to add that layer to smooth out those imperfections and give you the best quality video stream the best quality Zoom teams Skype all of those different real-time applications that you folks are trying to do that's where peplink comes in we make those things work every time so that you can take starlink and you can take cellular Wi-Fi and get the best of both worlds and back those each back each other up and smooth out those gaps that each one of them has and so that's really the story that we're going to let each of our panelists tell you today and just get into the details of how they've done it in their specific situations so with that we're going to Dive Right In Here first up we've got mobile must have so Eric I'm going to hand it over to you and let you explain what we've got going on in the picture here and just what your experience has been overall with starlink and folks this is going to be an open format so you can expect I will ask questions you can expect other panelists to be asking questions if you want throw questions in the chat we'll try and mix some of those in but there's really going to be a discussion not just a presentation and so again very much welcome questions across the board here so Eric yeah thanks Travis that's so true I never thought I would become such good friends with my local logger up in New Hampshire because he's been clear cutting trees to get my my fixed mounted starlink we're not covering right now to work much better on my my rural cabin but uh but absolutely it's it's it's definitely why we're you know whether it's peplink or something else we've always felt that when aggregation is so important you have to have one more than one connection to the to the internet there's just no one perfect connection and uh and you know peplink has just been our go-to for ease of use and ability to just add so many connections so what you got here is some close-up pictures of uh my setup inside of in inside of my motorhome which is a a larger Class A but uh you know this is pretty mix and match with just about any RV um at the heart of our setup well let me start a little bit earlier basically what this can do is give me four simultaneous connections uh with the current setup and I'll explain the components in a minute but we have a cellular modem one a cellular modem two uh starlink and then we also have a 5G Dome uh HD Dome that is pictured in there as well now if we're interested in using starlink in the dome at the same time because we are utilizing a Transit Pro we would utilize starlink on the Wi-Fi Wan Source but that Wi-Fi wind flexibility allows me to use the WAN wired port for that HD Dome and starlink off Wi-Fi Wham or we can simply just swap an ethernet cable pretty quickly that's one of the benefits of utilizing the speed Fusion connect is I can have one link go down while I'm swapping it back and forth and it doesn't affect my overall connection as long as I have one of my two primary cellulars up and running if I utilize Wi-Fi when I can have up to five simultaneous connections up from four because Wi-Fi when will go with both the 2.4 and the 5 gigahertz separately so there's a lot of Wan flexibility the transit Pro that is featured here we were really excited about it replaced our Transit Duo and that gave us a lot of added coverage at a really aggressive price point mainly because of this switch up to the category 7 cellular modem that is in that device which gave me access to band 71 the rural band for T-Mobile and really rounded out my cellular coverage so I have that category seven and category 12 combo device and then obviously I have the 5G kind of rock star super fast if necessary in the dome to round out that solution since I built this the br2 has come out but that's at a higher price point but for folks that potentially were really interested in uh Ultra fast speeds and not having to swap the WAN cable the br2 is kind of the way to go because you get the two wired Wan ports so you could have starlink in the dome or utilize the USB port on that that modem is is a rock star but it bit more price point wise than our average customer we sell quite a few of those but but uh but the transit's kind of our Mainstay um for folks that are new to peplink are just kind of diving into this we have a lot of different products and a lot of different models and so the technology is basically the same across all the products we have speed Fusion that lets you take more than one connection and put them together in ways that really solves connectivity challenges like you know poor audio quality on Zoomer teams but uh Eric's talking about different models that support even more than you know several connections and so I guess Eric what do you see when you're out and about like how many you know you've got a lot of different connections deployed on your on your system how many do you see actually used at any given location when you go from you know one campground to another or as you're moving around yeah it's kind of interesting because I started looking at my cost per gigabyte and starlink was by far my highest cost per gigabyte and the reason for that is because they don't use it very much um the vast I I have an 80 20 Rule and I kind of covered this in a personal blog post that I'll I'll share with folks that has wiring diagrams and stuff like that when we wrap up but um when we started doing an analysis over a year of traveling we were utilizing starlink 20 of the time and cellular 80 of the time that was kind of the gist of it Wi-Fi does come into play there but it's it's pretty minimal and it's when you're it it's become even less so in the in the in the starlink era Wi-Fi is just not necessarily something I always needed Wi-Fi at a campground when there was no cellular but now I have starlink but it still can come into play like you said I like to park under a tree shade is nice when it's 95 degrees and that uh that amount of sky that you need uh for starlink is is quite is quite High um that being said um I gladly pay the starlink fee every month um it tends to be along the Colorado River uh the Southwest uh where there are no trees really uh anywhere where I'm in a valley I I am loving my starlink it is saving me where cell signal just can't cover can't get over those mountains yeah it doesn't kind of bleed down into those bowls or valleys like you said interesting yeah and I think you know to kind of I know there's a lot of folks that want to share so I'll wrap it up but I think the real key for me with this I I operate this system for work like what we're doing right now I'm in the RV right now having this call Via this system but I have a two-year-old toddler who thankfully is not in the RV right now but my wife is not technical she works in Human Resources my son just wants to watch PAW Patrol and as we're driving down the road the peplink solution that self heals and understands how to manage Wan priorities and deal with all of that means that I was able to drive from New Hampshire to Lake Havasu Arizona with a family behind me and while doing Zoom calls and have zero dropouts in that connection and had zero use of starlink I used starlink once I got there but because it wasn't really a mobile friendly solution I relied heavily on those Cellular Connections and just have had absolutely great success with with how this is configured to to give me just total flexibility on the internet connection side whatever I need um will work and whatever is failing or offline simply just goes into disabled status and and the the router can kind of keep things going without a lot of direct intervention from my family or me I think that that connectivity management piece is a really good one that you brought up and we'll kind of keep touching on that but you know the main reason here you need more than one connection is so that you can work I think that's kind of the short story to all of this is work is the thing that's driving most of us to want to expand our connectivity options because when you sit I mean I spend four plus hours a day on live calls and so if I'm going to try and do that elsewhere I need four hours of bulletproof reliability right I can't have garblies and blocky video and those things happening and so that's why I think all of us on this call are bringing multiple connections to the mix but doing that is complicated in most cases and so peplink is what makes that easy right you can manage your cost per gig you can prioritize those links in that order of cost and then it just does it right you just drive you just show up you just park and maybe you have to go put your dish out but you know that's the most work you have to do to really uh you know manage those connections once you've once you've set those up so thank you Eric we'll keep digging into this absolutely if anyone just to wrap if anyone is interested in any wiring diagrams that dive deeper into that I have everything up at uh starlink.mola must have.com awesome all right ozan floor is yours please tell us what we got here we got some sweet speed tests here so let us know what you're doing out there with Starling and peplink yeah hi everybody um um so we've been uh providing connectivity for events for about 10 years and across that time we've used pretty much absolutely everything in trying to bring connectivity onto these sites uh but Central to that has always been everyone for us the ability to be able to aggregate multiple one uh connections together and to be able to have these automatically fail over um and self-heal have been critical for some of these Mission critical things I mean when you've got 700 plus devices that are all taking payments um you know through a 12-hour session um and that's the main Revenue income for that Festival because of their bars and everything else Mission critical that these don't go down what's been a game changer in the past two years for us has been Starling um we've managed to build systems where we can use multiple styling fishes together uh we can Bond these dishes together we can aggregate all the bandwidths that comes through and give us the amount of uptime that's available uh we've done some serious tweaking and some serious um configuration tests across multiple different peplum devices which results in some of the speed tests that you can see on the screen now where we're dropping you know latency timestamps as low as seven milliseconds in some cases um you know that's that's that's 100 down to uh peplink and the the infrastructure that they've allowed us to build through our sd-wan and everything else that goes with it um that ability to control end-to-end packet uh uh Direction and and just you know the level of detailed control that we can have has been absolutely everything that we could possibly want so when we talk about bonding I think this is important to explain to people is kind of a technical detail but it's a technical detail that really matters in in practice um you know there's there's connect there's lots of routers that have multiple connections or multiple lands and so you know you could take another manufacturer's cellular router and you could plug a couple starlinks in some of those have more than one Wan ports and you could do that but what you get with that is you get what's called load balancing there so they're going to take uh your Skype call or your Zoom call or your team's call and they're gonna they're gonna balance that out they're gonna say okay this is a team's call I'm gonna put this one on starlink dish number one and if that starlink dish number one has like a slow roam or it doesn't quite have the right line of sight to the sky that call is going to get interrupted if that dish has an interruption it's not going to be able to switch over to that other dish because it's load balanced and it's stuck basically on that first connection that it got sent to and so that's how most routers work when they use multiple connections they stick that traffic on one connection or another and you know that's how the internet expects things to work and so it's not a problem necessarily until your connection starts having that problem you lose you don't have that ability to react real time it's only making decisions based on when you started the call not based on now and so with bonding we're doing all of that combination at the packet level and so that's real time every every second every millisecond we're making new decisions about which dish to use for this packet and that packet and so how does that you know that I I believe that that capability is very important to what you guys do it was on but you know how does that translate into the difference between solving a problem and not solving a problem I mean the way that we have the system set up specifically with starlink I mean you know normally we deploy uh our systems with two or three starlings we have got as big as eight um it's been uh challenging but the fact that we've got these systems built into pep link where we can you know uh take multiple connections and build them in such a way where they become resilient where they become uh we have much much more bandwidth available to us to be able to do things that we wouldn't quite normally be able to do in the middle of a field in the middle of some rural County somewhere in the UK um has just made things so much better I mean the way that I normally explain uh load balancing to people is that your internet connection is only as fast as your slowest connection um and you can quite easily over overloads those connections very very quickly but the way that the uh the peplink system takes all these connections Aggregates the bandwidth together and gives you so much more means that you've got so much more scope to be able to push more services down so in this particular slide we were running you know we had 750 devices connected we had CCTV we had telephones running we had multiple Wi-Fi networks and all of this was running you know with an attendance of over 30 000 people the reason that we chose starlink in this particular case was um there were quite significant power lines that run through the middle of this site which was providing significant Interruption with four and five G um so starlink was the only option for us to be able to pull off this event um and it worked flawlessly we didn't have any issues we know when there were slight wobbles on The Styling system just sorted it out for us it just balanced it all out smoothed out those connections nobody was none the wiser of anything going on and and that's why we've gone down this road and that's why we've standardized everything that we do on a public device you know to me it's about that user experience right you know like you said if you've got little hiccups and skips on this dish or that dish traditionally some percentage of your users would feel that right you'd have 20 of your users or whatever percent were on that connection would feel that and they would experience that problem and the other ones maybe wouldn't but that's what speed Fusion does differently is we let all of those users continue to have a good experience by dynamically shifting those connections back and forth and that's a unique technology that's something again other cellular routers can't do and it's something that enterprises pay you know tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars for other technologies that do similar things and so peplink gives you that experience at a much lower cost of ownership and it's really starting to turn heads in the Enterprise space in terms of how they're deploying starlink to there's some really big name deployments out there happening that we're not really able to publicly disclose but um again this speed Fusion technology is just unique it's not normal for end users like rvers to be able to purchase technology that does these kinds of things that's not something that's been accessible to an end user before and you know it may seem expensive to to folks that are in an RV but you know these are things that cost fifty to a hundred thousand dollars for for Enterprises to do these same things and so that's that's what speed Fusion is really doing is making this technology accessible to everybody just like just like starlink has done with satellite connectivities satellite connectivity used to only be reserved for the super rich because it was just not affordable at all and so starlink has expanded that audience dramatically and it's the same thing that peplink is doing with speed Fusion we're making that audience of people that can actually afford and take advantage of this technology much much wider and so with that I'm Travis another quick thing on that that's so key we had we I filmed a video and it was kind of so light I had to add it to another video because there wasn't enough content it took us less than three minutes to configure speed Fusion connect with the new interface it's like five clicks anyone can do it that is so key it's not only is it inexpensive it's easy yeah and that you know you I can't I'm glad you brought that up because I should not Overlook that piece because yeah this this is technology that people are paying you know fifty hundred thousand dollars for and they're paying very very skilled senior Network Engineers multi six-figure salaries to configure these things and we we've kind of avoided the need for that part of it too I'm not saying don't have good Network people but you don't need good Network people if it's just for you or or your bus or your your boat it's uh it's not that hard it really isn't and we're trying to make it as easy as we possibly can so again Steve I'll let you talk about how you've used this technology in your situation yeah thanks uh Travis so um I live on a boat but also uh the folks that I work with most of the time um also either live on their boats or spend a lot of time on their boat as well and the challenge with the boat is is similar to an RV you know it's a it's a mobile platform we're out and about we have limited power uh in in many cases but for a boat if you're using it the the right way in my opinion which is at anchor and out enjoying yourself you're always moving even when you're stopped right so when you're at anchor you're slowly rotating you're moving around and cellular has been our go-to for ages um mainly because you know it you can maintain that connection uh when you're moving around slowly hopefully a lot of the time there's challenges with that as well and the satellite market for boats has been pretty well established as well for a long time but the the cost of that are absolutely atrocious when it comes to insta isolation ranging from you know fifteen thousand to thirty thousand dollars for a single unit and three to ten thousand dollars a month just things that recreational boaters or folks that um you know aren't independently wealthy can't can't afford um so Cellular's been our go-to but starlink has really really changed that um quite a bit for us uh in in in the short term um the the problem for us is that like I said we we keep moving all the time um even when we're at a dock you know we're moving up and down with the tides so there's kind of two areas that peplink has really always been key for us and it's the same with starlink one is which everyone else has talked about multiple internet connections you absolutely need you know multiple connections and you need some way of dealing with that intelligently um you know I see plenty of people using starlink Standalone and then a cellular thing Standalone and half the time you know different people on the boat are switching between Wi-Fi networks that's just not usable and and you have to know which one's working at what time so you know having that multiple connections but also the way that it's dealt with and speed Fusion which we've talked about off and on throughout the presentation today is an absolute game changer for us you can throw all the connections into uh you know a speed Fusion connect setup um and then really set it and forget it uh so when you leave the dock you know you disconnect from the doc Wi-Fi when you're out cruising around cellular is up and running and starlink is down when you're at anchor as you rotate around different things come and go I mean it's it's an absolute Game Changer when it comes to not having to mess around with things constantly which on a boat you already have you know the threat of syncing catching on fire and all those other great things so you've got your mind pretty occupied and the last thing you want to do is is mess around with your internet so having those multiple connections is is key and starlink being one of those tools that we can use um whether you're you know at anchor or at the dock and then the other piece that that all kind of flows into that's super critical is the prioritization control and optimization right so because you're on a boat and you're out in the middle of nowhere your cell connection may not be as good as these cell connections look here on the slide so using the technology and peplink specifically like with speed fusion and some of the different properties that you can kind of delve deeper into will really help make sure that you're always connected all the time so my setups have been all kind of around testing starlink combined with everything else I'm currently using two starlink antennas uh one with an RV plan and one with the residential plan wildly different results from both of those and then in the Marine World We tend to chop our antennas and break things a lot to try to get them to work in an environment that they were never really meant to to work so the antennas are also flat mounted which gives them a lot better performance as well so lots of different combos of things all to try to stay connected while you're enjoying a Mai Tai that anchor and also working and working as in air quilts I think for me one of my favorite things that I've picked up on just watching starlink develop and unfold it was just how enthusiastically people are Hardware hacking these dishes I mean like you know just disabling the motors and there's just so many science projects going on out there to try and just really unpack this technology and figure out what can be done to improve and work around little little things like that and so you know I think that's one of the the best examples of just absolute creativity and work there is just combining multiple dishes disabling Motors and just kind of like changing the properties of how it works a little bit it'll be interesting to see how these uh strategies evolve and what you know official Solutions may come out as a result of these as well the other popular one is DC power too right which you've played with Travis and Eric has got stuff in his site um that can help you kind of navigate through that as well um and there's little small product offerings that have popped up from folks to to help you convert it to DC although you know that can be a limit limiting factor if you if you're not super technical and of course you've got all sorts of warranty issues there but for folks on boats in particular and I know this has to be similar for the RV side of things especially sailboats power is a factor you know and if you don't have to run that that additional Wi-Fi router and you can connect it into a peplink device that draws a heck of a lot less power but gives you all this flexibility um you know that kind of hacking I'm all for so yeah and that's one thing that I think can be challenging for people too is I'm glad you said it is power you know these Starling dishes are are thirsty they want High wattage power they take a lot of power to run them and that's challenging in a mobile environment especially when you're in a remote location so yeah DC power inverters there's lots of different ways that people are powering these things in Mobile situations and you know with varying uh success and varying risks and um you know varying results too um cool we're going to move over to Eric Johnson from Type X and talk about a more industrial energy industry focused use of starlink and peplink so Eric I'm going to hand it over to you and let you talk about some of the pictures we've got up here sure so uh speaking of DC power we run all of our star lengths on DC if you look up at that picture in the top left there you can kind of see what's going on we got a small battery system some Microtech switches and if you can sneak in the way back there you'll see the balance 20x but um boy I can't talk or Rave enough about the balance 20x especially at the price point a gigabit throughput router that has speed Fusion cell router or cell modem just an amazing product yeah I guess talk about a little bit about what we do is we have containers throughout North Dakota and Montana that are on active gas sites and these sites essentially are extracting oil from the ground but they have no pipeline to get rid of the methane the propane any of the other gases that are leaking so what their current solution is to just Burn It Off so there is literally unlimited energy potential out here and that's what we're doing we are hosting mobile data centers that mine Bitcoin and if you have any knowledge of mining you know that you need 100 uptime if these miners are not submitting to their pool or to their shares they're not making money and if they're not making money then your clients get mad and so speed fusion and starlink have just been an absolute Game Changer here we can take that starlink run the priority of our traffic over it because we know it's going to be up 99 of the time and bandwidth isn't really a concern for us we really just care about that latency and uptime and if for some reason we lose view of the satellite the balance 20x has that Verizon sim in it and instantly fails over just an incredible solution so your minders don't go offline if you switch from starlink to to Verizon they they stay up they keep hashing and exactly they don't care and the big thing that this that speed Fusion has enabled us to do is before each container is essentially needed its own little computer in it um whether that computer was monitoring the miners or doing the VPN well we don't need that anymore now we can run all those servers in the cloud I can maintain everything from my bedroom we don't have to roll a trunk if a Raspberry Pi goes down I mean this is just going to save us an incredible amount of money and I'm guessing being these are in the middle of North Dakota these are not easy places to get to not short drives not uh not good sales exactly but yeah I mean the nearest site is two hours away and then most sites are going to be at least a half hour from each other and if anybody has ever lived up here driving around in the winter is not fun I know how that goes I I know you're paying there Eric yeah I mean this is just cool in a lot of ways right I mean number one I think just forget peplink and Starling what you guys are doing is awesome right you're taking free energy right you're you're taking pollution and you're converting it into actual dollars it can be used and I think that just in itself is fascinating but it's I think these technologies that make that a lot more possible and a lot more viable being able to get that connectivity out in these far-flung places again right they don't have infrastructure out here because they're not in popular areas and so being able to bring this connectivity out there and make that reliable makes I to me I think probably makes it a much more viable business for for folks like yourselves absolutely well excellent we're going to move over to Tyler with RDH last but not least Tyler you've got some pretty awesome stuff here on on your pictures and I just I love I love what you guys do overall but I'll let you kind of take over and tell us what what the heck we got going on here yeah no I appreciate it uh so uh what you've got here on the on the picture on the left is actually a an expo for our industry again we work primarily with the film and television industry uh here in the state of Georgia uh but we had a couple of our our systems on display for for the folks to be able to learn more about of our our services and solutions uh and and what we do you know specifically after the the pandemic is our industry has become very uh reliant on remote collaboration uh and communication uh the pandemic put our industry into a very interesting place uh trying to get back online allowing less people to be on set on on the production locations and being able to still uh collaborate and have their real-time input uh but be in safer locations as you know their house or Studio environment and so what that pushed us to do is create Solutions where we're creating we're standing up networks and we're tearing them down either on a daily basis weekly basis monthly because what this industry is is we're just a traveling circus uh and that those are the uh so we provide we provide internet to the to the circus uh what the the unit the the tallest unit you see in the photo there uh is uh aerial man lift that we use to be able to get not only uh the maritime until we use the same Maritime Den tennis that Steve uses uh bonding those four connections uh up in the sky but also being able to bring starlink up into the air because you talked about at the beginning of your presentation about how uh you know if you want to stay in under the shade and under the trees starlink's not that great of a solution then uh but for us you know the kind of the same caveat of of cellular especially in the state of Georgia the geographical changes as well as Vegeta thick vegetation create that cell loss that you get the further away you are from a cell tower so our solution is to be able to get up in the air be able to get as clear line of sight not only to the cell towers but also as much like you just mentioned as much aperture to the sky as possible so that's that's the kind of solutions that we're providing we also uh kind of stacked in with it if you can see the separation is a light towers so we've been converting light towers to be able to provide cellular to what we call Base camps uh so we're cre we're not only providing light to the to the base camps but also providing Wi-Fi and where Starling comes into play with that is some of these base camps are getting deployed in you know large farms uh way out in in eastern and southern Georgia or you know and not where there's a lot of Metropolitan cellular communication far away from interstates and so we still use peplink to be able to create these complex deployments we've got a lot of access points a lot of routing and switching that are going onto these ruggedized deployments but we still need to be able to provide that Network and that's where starlink comes into play being able to allow the Remote Management to be able to allow the point-to-point networks because some customers we have permanent head-end devices in their data centers and we're allowed we're able to with peplink be able to create those point-to-point networks and allow them to reach out onto the edge as if they were working at you know we've got visual effects artists that are able to work in their trailers been able to connect to servers uh back in the Studio's data centers and be able to access that equipment and we're not in some of those situations not doing it over cellular because we don't have that access and they need that extra throughput so that's where starlink comes into play as well when when combined with peplink and you wouldn't we wouldn't be able to do that with with any other uh any other provider I just want to like stress the the gravity of like the networks you guys are building out in these remote areas too like this isn't just like a pop-up like you know like oh we're gonna get 10 people on a hot spot you guys are building like multi-gig video production workstation grade networks like so there there are I mean it's just it's really mind-boggling the the level of network connectivity that you're building out in the middle of nowhere for you know what really is just a temporary use but um it's just kind of fascinating to me to see like really high grade Enterprise networking being done from scratch on them out in the middle of a field it's pretty cool stuff yeah it's it's exciting and it was actually when we were talking with these other the other panelists a couple days ago you know we've with the starlinks what we've been able to to bond is uh four on a unit uh and then bonding two different separate batches of four together to be able to make eight uh and but uh one of our first deployments one of the most complex ones we deployed and we've done it a couple of times since then was creating a one gig network over cellular we partnered and that project was deployed in in less than 12 days and we pushed 3.8 terabytes of data per day over that Network um but that was a very complex deployment from a cellular standpoint the amount of antennas required the amount of cabling the amount of infrastructure uh and the what's great about starlink is we're able to now get some up to the same megabit throughputs that we were getting over cellular and being able to deploy it much faster but still have the same ability to have complex and Powerful deployments that have a lot of security requirements a lot of network complexity but also easily to deploy and configure in the field quickly with peplink and what mentioned what we what you had mentioned uh was the epx and that's something that we're actually very interested to now take as many starlinks as we can put on that device and see how fast of a network we can create out in the field uh so it's just it's it's really exciting to see what's possible to be built and pushing the envelope of of combining cellular and and satellite with pebbling very cool yeah and I think I think it's really important to point out to people you know we've got five experts here that are doing all kinds of different things for all kinds of different people and so we're showing you I think what's maybe just a lot of people may be really complex setups or large scale setups and so like I said at the beginning public has a lot of different products a lot of different options and they all have this capability inside of them called speed fusion and so you don't have to go nearly as far as these folks are to solve your problem right your problem might not be as big as these folks as problems so you can take you know like Eric showed with that balance 20x that's a very you know that device costs less than five hundred dollars it's got the cellular built in so that's a you know a much more approachable device for somebody who had just wants their Zoom to work better wants their teams to work better right you don't have to go five cellular and eight satellites and all these different things right you can get some of these benefits with much more approachable Solutions as well but there's that ladder of sophistication that you can climb up if you've got bigger harder more complex challenges that you need to solve as well so you've got access to both both sides with peplink we make it easy but we've got the equipment that can handle the much more complicated scenarios and so I'm it's it's really relevant for you know just about anybody that needs better mobile connectivity it's not just for these super complex unique applications there's a whole spectrum of ways that people can do this I'm going to show you folks just one one more case study real quick and then we'll just start diving into some questions and and we'll hang on I know we're just a few minutes left on the scheduled window here if panelists can stay on that's great if they have to drop uh that's fine too but I'll hang on for a little while and try and just plow through some questions here but this last one we've got a picture uh this was me well that picture is not me but I took the picture uh last weekend we were out with Subaru Motorsports they were wrapping up their rally season last weekend in Marquette Michigan and they had the Lake Superior performance rally and as with all rally races for those who know these are far-flung locations the worst of the worst in terms of connectivity we are just in the middle of the forest in the middle of nowhere in Michigan and you know you can see we've got the the maritime antennas there on a case you can't see the case awesome in that picture but um you know we had we had connectivity to one cell carrier we had a bar or two from one carrier but you know that's just not enough to upload we uh we we did a three minute interview at the at the finale of this stage with uh Brandon semenek the the driver who actually ended up winning the championship that day but um we recorded an interview with him and it was 500 megabyte file I mean it's a big file and you're not going to upload that with one bar right they were doing a live broadcast at that moment and we needed to get this footage back to the back to the production bus so that they could get that clip on air during the show and again one bar 500 megabyte file that would have taken two hours probably to do that and so in this case we had to rely on the starlink and we didn't have time to test all the connections and figure out which one worked we just showed up we plugged everything up we stood the tripod up and we got that video uploaded and it got into the live broadcast right away and so we didn't have to think about it right we planned for it we we were ready for it but when we were there we didn't know exactly what we were going to to be dealt with and so I mean we had five minutes to get there and get set up we literally just about missed the interview because this was such a hard to get to location and we didn't miss the interview right it just worked we plugged it in we turned it on and we got it and we sent it and and it worked great and so again those are the things that we're able to make easy for you so that you don't need I.T people out in the field you don't have to think about it after it's done you just let it work and go about your go about your job and so that was just really fun for me to see firsthand and experience that because it's stressful I mean in their environment it's now it's now or it's or you missed it and that's that's all there is there's no Second Chance on them for them and I think that's the case for a lot of people trying to do things in very remote areas it just has to work every time so like I said thank you so much we've got uh that brings us to the end of this I'm gonna stay on here and plow through some questions and then after the webinar is done everybody who registered will get a an email with a link to this presentation to the recording of it so they can you can watch it offline go back and review it and then again it might take us a week to get uh the question summary published but we will also distribute that via email to you folks so again I'll answer some questions now I'm gonna just first off though just invite the panelists um again a lot of people have asked about settings you know so how are you configuring speed Fusion to work with starlink um are you doing it to bond multiple starlinks are you doing it to combine starlink with other Technologies um anybody out there on the on the panel can just kind of chime in but yeah how are you configuring your speed Fusion tunnels to make this work the best possible and I mean I can jump in if nobody else is going to talk um at least on the on the Boating side of the world few people have more than one starlink some people do I do but most people have a single starlink and it's met to supplement what they already have right cellular and other things so speed fusion um you know obviously is critical in that situation uh for in terms of settings uh we go in and at least uh turn on land smoothing uh for sure uh we put that usually for most people the reason they're using it or the the reason they they have these requirements is that they're working remotely right so they're doing video they're doing teams in Zoom like we're doing today they're doing other things that are sensitive to latency and packet loss so we go in and turn on uh Wan smoothing Forward Air correction uh when smoothing we put in the normal level for both of those options for Forward Air correction we're using low and then for traffic distribution we use the dynamic weighted bonding and we do turn on low for congestion latency level all that Tech speak basically means um we're trying to to monitor the connection Beyond just using multiple connections for those who've never really played around with speed Fusion we're trying to use some of that special sauce that peplic has in speed Fusion to monitor things like packet loss latency the quality of the connection um it does cost more uh in terms of your bandwidth um and and usage because it's sending out duplicates of traffic over certain things but most of our customers would prefer that so that if they do lose a link or when they do lose a link because it happens all the time that their video sessions are uninterrupted so that's that's where we focus things there's a lot of other basic options that we turn on but those are the the pretty key areas land smoothing air correction and then some congestion stuff yeah I think when smoothing is a good one to just I'll over give people an overview um you know these are unpredictable non-guaranteed what we call best effort links right starlink is not guaranteed cellular is not guaranteed there is no SLA for those of you in the Enterprise World Service level agreement if you're buying Enterprise connectivity it comes with some sort of percentage of uptime they're guaranteeing that you're going to see 99.99 or some sort of guarantee of what your consistency should be like and those are just not things that come with cellular or any any wireless connection basically and so people want that because they want their applications to work that reliably right when you you want 100 of your business calls to be usable and able to communicate and so that's what we're doing is we're we're basically brute forcing our way into that guarantee we're not able to guarantee it in a true sense but we utilize those multiple Connections in a strategy that assumes one or the other will fail so land smoothing sends multiple copies of your your team's call out so that as a cellular link or starlink has an interruption that other connection is already sent a copy to back that up so there is no loss in video because it came in from the other connection and not the the one that maybe had an issue and so that's what that's what went smoothing does is it doubles the traffic which doubles your usage but it gives you a much better chance that avoiding those those painful issues of packet loss and Jitter and high latency that that you might experience and really ruin your Zoomer teams call otherwise so it's it's just a strategy to give you that SLA type of experience on these non-guaranteed links I think Travis one of the other great things you guys have is that option to have multiple tunnels so we've set up customers where they have an SSID that says you know Dash WS for land smoothing and we're like don't use that unless it's your Zoom call and then they just move between their Wi-Fi networks uh depending on the the uptime requirements and the amount of bandwidth they have available the other comment um with the dynamic weighted bonding I think has been it's like a Hidden Gem in the settings that I don't think a lot of folks understand or know is there and that's inside of the uh the the primary tunnel settings and that's magic really benefits yeah it's because the whole sd-wan concept was you know oh I got two dsls they're basically identical and that's how it's going to operate and the uh the dynamic weighted bonding just does such a great job when your links are are are diverse and do not have the same upload and download speeds yeah that's a that's a great Point Dynamic weighted bonding is just a another mode of speed Fusion that you can set and like you said Eric you can you don't have to pick one of these modes right you can configure your speed Fusion connect so that you've got a Wan smoothing mode and you've got a bonding mode and like you know like with Subaru as an example they've got situations where they're doing a live stream directly from their phone to Facebook or Instagram live or YouTube live and so that's a streaming application right they need that consistency they don't need 100 megabits per second to stream they need one megabit per second all the time right but again sometimes they're recording a video and then uploading that to a production stack and that's a different way to send video so they're trying in that use case they need the speed they want that 100 megabits so that they can shuttle that video up it doesn't need to be consistent because it can just re-transmit something it doesn't have to be real time when you're uploading like that so they also have two different ssids so that they can best adapt to those two different use cases as they're in different locations and yes for them it's just telling their media guy or girl switch from the streaming SSID to the internet SSID that's all I have to do they don't have to be technical people they just have to pay attention to which network they're on and that's all I got to do any other best practices out there in terms of configurations or settings that other folks have experienced or or tested with I know we've got um you know again there's different ways that people are doing this there's some you know I know we've got one deployment it's definitely a high visibility one but it's a it's a ship and it's completely away from cellular coverage most of its time at Sea and so satellite or you know cellular just isn't that useful to that ship and so in their in their use case they're bonding over 10 dishes so they're taking over 10 starlink dishes and they're smashing all that bandwidth together because there's just a lot of people on these boats and you know for them they have to use that Dynamic weighted bonding even though they are all the same dish each dish at any given moment is getting different throughput different latency different packet loss and so dealing with all those different variations is really what dynamic weighted bonding was designed to do like like you said Eric is use those kind of asymmetric connections and make that a really clean consistent experience and efficiently get that bandwidth out of those different connections as they kind of go up and down in capacity so that's something we developed over the last two years it's you know we just never stop right we're not ever satisfied with what we're able to do with speed fusion and you know with starlink there's more room for improvement there too we're gonna we're continuing to eke out performance and efficiency when we're bonding starlink plus starlink starlink plus cellular there's lots more that we're working on to just further improve that that speed Fusion capability and efficiency yeah and thank you again for not only this but just the unified operating system across all of the devices is is at least for someone who has to support it but also for the average customer who has to utilize these devices is just it really helps us uh you know deploy these and ensure that they're working reliable just that everything has the same operating system has been great yeah I've seen a lot of people ask about the dish Hardware what generations and what plans are you folks using when you're setting this up for customers what what are you folks finding works well and is kind of worth the money uh I've got all of the versions but I wouldn't recommend most of them um the maritime one is an absolute I mean unless you're independently wealthy I can't afford five thousand dollars a month for the service it's a great solution but at least for boaters uh I don't know that that's really uh that's really an option I know for some of the other guys on the call there's options um from the or some of those the residential or sorry the business and the maritime versions are are great um for the commercial side but at least for the Boating world the RV plan is probably the most popular um it's got limitations in terms of being rate limited when you're in different places but either that or the residential options seem to be the most popular from from the monetary perspective when you get into the business plans at least for uh boats you know smaller than 100 feet that gets a little difficult um just because you're trying to sell them a whole package with the starlink side with the peplink side Wi-Fi Marine antennas and you can quickly get you know beyond ten ten thousand dollars which can be a little bit of a price point Point challenge for some folks on the Boating side yeah yeah we have a business dish that is the 500 a month or so business plan uh and at least in Southern New Hampshire the performance on that dish is not uh showing numbers that are that they're greatly in excess of another one we have that's on the RV plan so even though the dish is about twice the size and it has higher speed uh caps we do see some minor changes but it's it's not like four times the speed but that could be very much location dependent but it's just a piece of information oh and I can I can second what Aaron mentioned Eric mentioned is you know the the Enterprise dishes don't really step much above the uh the RV deployment now if you're worried about the legalese uh and everything that they have to say and the fine print of your your use cases and and how you're deploying it uh then absolutely take a deep read um but as we've I think a lot of us has mentioned uh we're chopping these things up and trying to see what we can uh what Next Level we can take them to and RVs that has been the most cost effective Tyler and in terms of what you're talking about in uh the legalese side are you talking specifically just the business versus personal use yeah correct if you're applying with a business if you're applying for business use but you don't want to spend the business price uh the RV is going to get you very close to the same performance yeah I think on the legal side I always the the question and I saw it a couple times in the Q a too is can we use the RV plan underway you know that sort of thing technically you're not supposed to we know there's lots of people that are but that's I think the one thing that that I've struggled with with starlink is just the constant landscape that's changing which is a perfect reason why you need other things involved to make sure you're always connected right that I we have to remember or I oftentimes have to remember that it's only been what five six months since we've been able to use this stuff like reliably before then yeah there's so many restrictions in place it wasn't even a viable option and what what's it going to be like next year right so it's it's a constantly changing landscape yeah and I can say that not not a single one of our deployments has it just been starlink only uh starlink is always there to supplement what we're deploying from a cellular standpoint as a end-all beetle yeah and I think you know in some cases you know starlink might be the only connection you could conceivably get right that that's definitely a possibility because of the technology and its capabilities but in those situations if you're bonding you know 10 or more dishes even you're still relying on one set of infrastructure in the background and so you're still susceptible to a complete outage if you know even if it's multiple connections to that one provider that one provider can have a bad day and they will you know frankly they will every provider does I'm not pointing any fingers at anybody but that's the reality of of staying connected is if it is your only connection you don't have the remote capability remote control capability being able to get uh into the device if you weren't there whereas if you're putting a pep Link in line with that solution you can uh be it you know via in control now via in touch you know and add you know word exploring our ways into that in new abilities of being able to be able to reach our hands into any IP device possible I mean it's just if that's a great feature um to come from the ic2 sign and if you have only just one star link you still have all of those abilities by adding a peplink inline that's a good point and I mean in touch isn't directly related to starlink here but like you said operationally when you're able to extend connectivity into those new areas that means you're able to extend your entire operation in there and configure those remote encoders or IP phones or you know those other servers that might be at those locations once once you get that pipe you've got all these tools available to start using and uh leveraging that so yeah that's a good point Tyler I'm glad you brought that up um one question here from the from the group is speed Fusion application aware for example recognize which applications need bandwidth versus low latency yes um and that's a great question because you know we've talked about like oh I've got a streaming SSID and then I've got uh you know an upload SSID and that's one way to do it for sure the other way to do it is to map your applications to those policies so you only need one SSID and it will just say hey Zoom you go on the land smoothing policy and Facebook you go out the bonding policy and you know you can definitely do it that way the only real catch to that is you have to be very confident that you know all of the applications that you may need to use those Technologies with so you know if you're going to use a new social platform you have to have a policy for that social platform in place before you start streaming so that you catch that traffic so it can get a little bit tricky that way but you know for some of you you're just using teams and that's all you need to do and yeah you can just map teams right to that Wan smoothing profile that's exactly how I have my setup configured right now as we're talking I automatically send teams and zoom to a Wan smoothing profile and then I've got um just my bulk internet traffic goes to a hot failover profile so I'm just using my landline and not using any metered cellular bandwidth on on my day-to-day normal internet traffic but I'm always using cellular to back up my zoom and teams calls and I don't have to think about that I don't have to switch networks so I've used that that application policy instead of different ssids but again there's just different ways to do this for different users different use cases so you don't have to do it the application way you can do it the SSID way or or vice versa so we try to make it easy and flexible for people um I think one other thing that I just want to kind of talk about real quick is just I I'm just amazed with with starlink and 5G I think it's so powerful that they're coming out and kind of taking shape right at the same time because this really gives Enterprise everybody really um just brand new options for creating really really robust networks right if you're able to combine 5G and starlink you don't have any wires coming into your facility right there's no lines to get cut I mean of course those Towers have lines and the starlink feeds back to a ground station somewhere but you've taken you know tens hundreds thousands of miles of susceptible cable that could get you know broken stepped on crashed into whatever you've taken that out of out of your mix out of your path and so you're just getting much more chances of of reliable fast connectivity when you combine these two connections and yeah it just it really opens up possibilities that were only possible with dedicated Enterprise guaranteed circuits not that many years ago and yeah it's going to really just change what anybody is able to do out in the field now so it's going to be really exciting to see how people use this technology now that they're kind of learning and aware of what they can do with it okay so I'm gonna just scan the questions real quick here but I think we'll probably wrap up again we will go through this list and answer a whole bunch of these questions I'm not ignoring them we want to make sure that you folks get answers there's so many things we could talk about we could talk about starlink and pep like all day long we could have an hour-long Deep dive just on configuring starlink I mean there's so many different places we could dive into it so we're going to try and give you as many of these answers offline as we can but thank you all so much for joining again this is just awesome attendance panel thank you everybody give your panel a big round of applause they're awesome they spent their time here and they shared a lot of Secrets right they're they're this is their business and they're telling you how they're doing this and so I I think that's just tremendously valuable and it's just a great example of just the peplink community and our spirit overall this is uh this is very normal for our community to sit here with each other and share stories and trade ideas and and let everybody kind of learn together because we're doing new big things that just other people aren't doing out there so as we all learn how to do this better we're all winning and able to solve these problems faster with each other so panel again thank you so much well I say it every day we wouldn't be able to be where we are without piplinking your guys's support so we appreciate it absolutely agree to that and thanks for putting this together Travis absolutely yeah we've we've just got an awesome team I mean our marketing team makes so much great content our engineers make this stuff possible and so it's fun to just get everybody together and let the stories get told so thanks again folks have a great day and you can see expect updates from us on the recording of this and again hopefully in a week we'll get some follow-ups on all these different questions you guys have put out there so thanks again and take care"}

{"topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "hi everyone i'm stumbling thanks for hanging out today today's sessions today we are talking talking about uh pce 4.0 section three uh the marketplace part we prepare around 15 questions for this session we will break it down to tell you how to find the answer uh where you come from the questions and how to do some searches within this page i'll assume you guys already knew uh public and public products back and the online comparison table because during the task you might use it a lot in case you don't know the online conversion table print is easy to remember just type in compare the public.com then you can access our online conversion table we support balance siri and max siri is easy to use you just use the drop down menu to select the right sku and you can compare it to the different models we support up to three models together then you can download the pdf uh as use as you see in the browser you can download download back directly things instead download the single spreadsheet okay so how do we design the cp exam we choose few topics uh as a major concept that we'd like to deliver to you guys for example i would say super fusion it is a key feature of this powering programming current vpn technology so we bring out these key functions and with some type of link some introductions white paper related webinar and we put some audio tutorials include the setting how do you do the vlc at essential and the next is a fusion hub the virtual space fusion compact appliance will help you to do a virtual knob in the cloud or in your private virtual machine and the next is a speed fusion club the specification cloud will bring you extend the super fusion bonding technology to the internet traffic why because in the modern days we expect the external solution can also support internet traffic we can bring this technology to the internet traffic is the major difference than others because others funding just happen in the vpn network but for the public we already have a service a satisfaction-based service that can help you bring your traffic bring your funding traffic to the internet and the next is the cloud management system in control 2 we can do the provisioning monitoring management and reporting in the cloud we also support ongoing system you can you can build your own ink control 2 in your private cloud and the nexu is not not so popular but we also support those features a rest api feature we support in controlled api basically you can use graph or get command to grab any data from the in control 2 server include your private host and another api is about the device api if you are able to write a script you can call the data from the device the written and the next file is wi-fi we don't talk wi-fi too much but it is in our i think our protagonist so we put some information here you can learn some highlighted launch the first example of the question now when we when we join the online test we will see the question and answer like this so uh first thing we need to do is to find the keyword the people in this question is routing broker is want to know or want to check what kind of the building block of the balance and max series support how do we know that the first thing is we can check the user menu we can use keyword launching protocol to do the search or we can go to the data page any balance or max device page we use convert on the browser use any option as keyword then we can find the information from the product page again there is a pc exam with a online test please allow allow to do some googling or do some searching from the public resource it is okay to do that uh our purpose is that letting you know where i can get a resource where i can get a correct information so it is the concept so after search we can find the answer here so isi is we don't support eitr people don't support but the popular general general voting brokers well we do support that the next question we find a key word in the question first the first is checking if we have a slicing issue on the fusion hub how do i choose the right fusionhub sku if i do answering this question i will go to the vision number page i will roll the way down to find the answer because we do put some conversion table about the different types of simplification of sku the difference between domes essential pro 100 500 autobra is the different peers we don't have any software's software cap on the speed limit to the fusion hub back to the three or five years ago we do have a software speed limit cap on the different sku but recently we already removed this speed cap so if you are using i say fenway version seven seven or five and there is no speed limit on the fusion hub the only difference is how many peers that sku support for the current version we are generally public selling is 4000 4k 4kp if you require more peers in your top polish you require more people to support and license please contact your public account manager we do have some master or special license can solve this issue i'm sorry again i will i want to mention this even though we don't have software speed limit cap but you need to assign enough resource to the fusion hub like cpu ram or or internet speed manual bandwidth otherwise this usability is on the hardware okay go to the next question uh this is about the actual setting experience is asking you uh which is situation cutting photo applied to an ssid instead of leader it's more like experience if you you do try you do complete protective photo uh also known as a social wi-fi then it is easy to understand but in case you don't do it we also have some forum or knowledge base and help to find the correct answer in this situation for this question we can try to search the field keyword like correctly photo and ssib then we can search some posts in the forum will tell you how to set up a social wifi or creative photo then we can after you you browsing through post you can see oh why what what situation we need to assign a cutting photo to the ssid instead of the feedback it's telling you if you want to assign the character photo profile to the public ap then you need to connect it to the ssid instead of vena okay so okay you can find some actual setting post for setting points in all forums most of them is under the knowledge base or you do have actual setting experience for example you two config links on the in control 2 management system then you will see a pin here at the bottom of the ssid setting it's attacking you if you want to connect to the getting photo to the hd to ssid that's that's all you need to do you need to academy photo to the ssid they will make you ap support the social wifi feature then if you want to apply this on the balance and max device you need to apply to the region that's the difference between the 80 and the balance and max view the next question is we try to make you understand how obama policy was working so we only want to choose the correct description so if you have actual setting experience on the traveling device it's easy to understand because we have a stand and x promoting if you enable the x vermont we can make the priority higher operation slightly higher than the vpn noting or b2b launching so in this question the answer is hey because uh the older we process the traffic is up to down so if you are not in the extra mode uh a vpn loading b2b ospf rebounding will become the first but if you in extra mode we can change the hormone policy priority okay then we also can have some detail settings uh in case there has no any policy uh that traffic can drop in we have a default one we can set the traffic connection go to the max policy or drop the traffic next question is about the discount code kind of like sales talk because for the engineers well we are hoping you uh learn some basic sales talk like uh [Music] introduce people of the public features so for example we would like to understand what we call the world virtualization so for the world virtualization uh these in our introducing page seon solution you'll define like this one virtualization is we can build a one logical one connection using multiple ones together as normal as we do the subdivision medium column we can find bunking them together to fall back or halfway over or bang with language bonding paragraph so we call one virtualization best questions is more technical when we but we we building speculation behind the firewall which means it's about a lot because most of and user have their own firewall as the first line to the internet but if we want to make vpn through their firewall we must open some communication ports so if you check our menu then you will see we will we have imported now to tell you uh our troubling revision vpn where you see use easily people and utv port to establish the connection and sending the traffic so if if you want to build the substitution behind the firewall our default setting is tcp 300 and udp pro 500 but if those two port number are occupied we support a customer's custom setup you can change the default default port number to any any more number you want this question is kind of tricky we do put some tricky question finger is during the exam for this question we are asking if you have a three side full mesh media deployment how many internet lines you need the quick answer you will think the taboos will be like this so totally is the sweet but actually not because you want to do a full mesh you need a breakup so it should be like this then the answer will be six next question this happens a lot for some end user those people first timers public device and we have a send default [Music] default ip setting to the sensory button for example if you use balance siri our default then ips is 192.168.1.1 and for the max series is uh 192.168.15.1 so when we use this the patch of the device uh especially is in the same series then the first easy thing happen is they will face a long conflict or ip conflict during do the vpn settings why because we can do the same lens subnets to the different end of the device so if you have a patch of device to view as the version bbn and please remember to change your ip settings to the device because to the default setting they are all the same and and if you need to if you have a you have a huge number of devices to come to the range uh we do support a block configuration configuration on in control 2. so you can do a block change to all the devices the next question is not so seen often it's not easy to see because he's under the question mark the question about sometimes we'll use it in the larger network deployment [Music] people want to use a virtual lego wrench in the same thing network we do support this feature virtual network mapping we support this feature but sometimes the time we use different time to describe the same function uh it's easy to check because if you use virtual network research during the user guide you can see we support this feature and it is hidden in the blue question mark the next question is about the questions so once mozing is a concept idea is thank you you know telling you what is the one smoothing purpose we used to enable the one small thing during the cctv transmission video code because the target of the one is noticing you will create a duplicate packet to another end that will help you to avoid the packet loss and reduce the jitter that's our our purpose one small thing and if you need to know the labeling about the one smoothing the basic label is we will multiple times and three times and four times for the maximum setting is based on the connections for the true end device if you have three different three three ones each side then you you you will have nine connections so in this diffusion economy if you enable the ones losing to the maximum level we will plus nine times the traffic to the another element the last question is easy because it is a concept idea is wrong to check what kind of the type of advisor that you should help support it's easy to find the question it's just we will describe this for our support environment so besides the caribbean we support the most popular virtual machine virtual machine in the world amazonia okay the next question is uh i i is about as you went to the internet traffic is our new technology subscription base service certification certification car and and auburn police because uh certification cloud is kind of service problem post the fusion hub to the internet so your device will still need to assign an open box but almost make the traffic go to this vpn content that will help you have a when responding from your end to the internet if this traffic doesn't go to this column then you will not you will not have this this funding and responding effort the next question is about the wi-fi for your information most of the parking balance and max device can be ap controller to the public ap for the minimum support is the five ibs to the max device for balanced device so if you use problem balance or use use coupling max voice versus the public because the ap controller the minimum support is a five degrees so the benefit of use public device of parents or max siri those ap controller is we can manage multiple ssids just like we did on the in control 2 but only the ssi dimension part we we also put some new product information to help you to understand our lady's power or baby solution in this case it is a max abductor 5g so max dr 5g is something like a plant-sized support usb connection and you can insert the point choosing character it's a kind of the portable portable 5g solution they can help you to make your current device a windows system linux system for mac system or you have a cisco sewage or cisco launcher they support usb connection and helping they support the usb bungle feature and helping have a 5g 5g way then you can use the max adapter 5g because the dongle okay the last question the last question is about api for the public api called incontroller api or device api we have some manual information that can help you to check out and we also support some reference only on the menu so it should be easy to use but we wanna help you to create your own command we do have some sample and we do have some about introduction uh but we will not help you or correct your script so the first thing we need to know is about the request rate because public income for two the public house one will build on amazon they have some uh level some security check or provisioning to prevent the eos attack so we said we set a period period to avoid search of the cyber attack so our standard is a country request per second organization not a group organization you can see this information in the public api document page so we will tell you the request right there but if you are private host in control advance there's no low limit on this in this document you also can see will show you how you make a connection or how to reduce and how how we do the security check if you want to use steam control api it is pretty much covered or we want be sure today so now let's let's check also questions in the faq okay from dennis uh it's a multiple this there might choice five okay but in in in the exam in this exam uh we don't have a certain type of the questions we have a multiple choice or we do have simple yes or no and we we do have some multiple selection so here's how to say we we mix those questions together and uh next question you just check it sorry i don't know how to pronounce your name but you raise the issue about the question four how can you control the traffic is no confirmation available okay if we if we we have a no anywhere then our policy doesn't work because our policy is from the land to one so our if you see here here is the bottom of of the urban policy this is a default one we can configure people behavior so if there has no connection then tropical shock so for the question for about open policy settings oh we have a visual rule in the bottom here let's say it's a default we can configure the behavior of the traffic if it doesn't fit any then you the traffic will drop so the next question i do not receive the earlier session through a video and pdfs um i think we will share will share the link the pce webinar link in our forum uh please search and go forward if you are not receive the session video and the videos and please check out check our forum we do post those information in the forum or you can compile it from sending mail to your public contact i will share the download link for you thank you the next question let's go to the question 10. let me throw the question about the question 10. we said why not cert for the answer c here's here's the forming part we have two two settings [Music] under the one's motion the first setting is we copy everything we duplicate everything every traffic to another app another option is from the video setting is of ec it only it doesn't he only copy the send send message to another ad so it doesn't check doesn't check the sequence to the whole traffic you just get then duplicate and delete it so it doesn't check the sequence to the to another end so this is the difference between the uh forward arrow correcting and the ones losing in these questions are we are asking about uh one sensing so so when you need to fix some cheater issue simply enable the ones music is the first easy option if you are a defense plan you know how to tune in the bigger settings then you might use your whole arrow correcting because it will reduce some redundant packet to solve the jitter issue [Music] for question 12. okay here's different between you you host your own fusion hub on for the data center the difference is the significant cloud service uh coupling provide a subscription system that can help you to control the data usage and the time period that you can sell this substitution to your end user with the alien service then we will announce uh i hope it is this very soon is on this roadmap this year we will we will announce an advanced uh solution is related about the supervision cloud we call the supervision relay it is about we will sell iot single that you can create a bonding the funding technology to the internet traffic so it is okay if you are your end user or you want to provide a service service to you to your users absolutely you can host a normal fusion hub on the data center and bring a huge part of the internet and share this service to them but you are not able to do the quota management or subscription management while probably probably into those parts so the difference between the normal fusion hub and supervision crowd is we publish already a development quota management association management system and this is not active we we also going to announce uh rte sync data plan with the supervision card also so this is the difference between a normal fusion hub in the data center and [Music] the industrial power service okay the next question is about a busy exam the lab test the laptops uh winter we are not public about the pc exam laptops we don't we don't public to everyone to do online tests but we do have some pc online tests with the in control 2 to some certified problems so if you are interesting about that test you want to do some actual computer settings and please send a message to your cutting content window that will arrange you to wrong to experience such the setting and the test for the dentist question 12 yes his question is why the option d is not the correct answer to this question i want to say uh under the speech cloud setting if if one demands we build a speedfusion cloud profile and the specification profile there are two different profiles to the device you will treat them as two different virtual weapons so when we want to internet traffic go to go to the specification cloud note we must correct we must select the correct virtual one which means the civilization call so if you choose supervision with obama policy to this question sorry is not correct or we will we will modify this this question may make it much clearer in case some misunderstanding to this question thank you dennis any questions as um okay let me check some you know question in the chat uh from the bottom to the top of zero see us asking the question uh in question 12 what about send all traffic to supervision tunnel option if we see the when we see the cenotrophic this is mean to the in the vpn tunnels the two ends if we enable this central traffic which means uh from the device land will send everything to the special sub-fusion cloud service which means it will consume a lot of the code data code the way we manage the supervision cloud where you we we set a data code set a quota to the usage so if we if we enable the zenon traffic to the vision club then you will come to your quota very very soon [Music] and the reach then it's an issue to the version 12. okay well when bank responding is another distribution to the submission bundle is not different to how that is no different to the bonding but to the certification funding we have to type of the different method to disappear our traffic the first one is the normal bounding we basically we use a 50-50 method for weight very low balance method to show to deliver the traffic in this prevention time another is dynamic way funding we we have our own algorithm assigned a travel traffic go to each one each session in those vpn tournaments so i will say there is a one bandwidth pumping we can 3ds equal to the speed version boundary [Music] and that you can you can find a previous recording and slide in the forum so if you want to if you're not receiving an email to emailing about the recording and the slides you might check the markers marco's logos in the chat room or simply you just search the pce for 4.0 from the forum you can find the post we will put that for these three sessions together [Music] always be a configuring always beer in the bubbling balance basically uh both of the balance advanced device support ospf settings so [Music] we're able to find this in the network under the language menu [Music] let's see so there's no other question left we will wait extra three minutes and you have the time to type your question or leave your message in the chat room but um you can go to our forum you can see the and use the search to pce 4.0 then you will see a forum post it will include all three session will update the information there you can see the slide download link and the recording recording link and if you want to go to the task uh please reduce a traveling id first then contact you open the window will open a free task for the for the one titles for you like marcus and question two yeah i will i will modify the questions of this question make it so more focused on the simplification count thank you max richard do you have to check your pleasure today uh you can do it uh late in later in this month is okay in this couple two or three three weeks is also his files any questions no i will thank you thank you for enjoying joining us today uh hope you have a good experience to these three sessions and we will you three sessions line and the recording to you guys through the email or in the front post uh we we are not a high standard to require two exam during the two weeks uh we're kind of kind of open about the timing if you feel free actually you can do it today or tomorrow or in the next one or two months i think it's okay we don't we don't have some deadline to the pce class but sooner you shouldn't you take the task uh it will help you to easy to answer the question because it is so close your memory is still clear okay thank you guys thanks thanks for joining us today uh i wish you can have a high score on the test during the test thank you guys as for your day bye"}

"hello everyone my name is cassie from kaplan team so welcome uh everyone to join our pc 4.0 training webinar session number two so today we same as last week we have invited our speaker and our trainer dennis from vitel generally helped us to deliver uh to train up the to deliver this training so uh welcome everyone and thank you dennis dennis how are you today thank you cassie oh i'm fine it's it's early morning in germany so it's 10 o'clock in the morning no not early so hello good morning good afternoon uh to everybody in the world yeah so now i'm in 4 p.m so i just want to have a quick weekend for the last uh webinar before you go start so last time we have uh thanks for your delivery about two hours session one and then we already sent out the recording and the slide to the registered candidate uh yeah the uh the candidate who would want to uh to register our webinar so this uh today after today then uh we will record today's webinar and then we will also send out the slide a calling me and last time we have a lot of questions are asked during the webinar and that's why we prepared another post called pce training session one q a so you will see over 20 uh questions there then you will see what is the answer from our uh from our panelists and that's why um you will have more ideas what is the training or what is our pattern upon us so this link you can also refer to the email that we sent you after the event so this is about um what is happening last time so last week we have the session one this week we have the session two next week uh after this uh session one at the end of the session two we will send uh we will have a link that this is a mock exam so you can if you are confident enough then you can try to the mock exam and then if you got everything uh passed and then you are you are very happy to do the take the challenge so you can just go to our training portal and then to test uh test for your ability however if you have already done the mini exam then you cannot get all the answer all the questions correct you can still wait for the next wednesday this wednesday the public team we have stone our pebbling team members to explain to the mock exam questions if you are not familiar with the questions and then you do not know why this answer is correct or not then you can you can listen to our tutor to teach you more about the background in this case then once you hear the questions and then you can also take the exam freely out in the training control and we also get a lot of questions asking hey you said that the event is free of charge for the pc exam so how can i know make sure i did not need to pay for any um dollars on that so in the session one we have the slide showing them and we also have another form post showing that how to take the exam so what you need to do is go to the training portal if you do not have a public id register a public id and then you go to the training portal if this is the first time for you to take the exam then the system will not charge you anything however if you've got emotional fails of the exam you can still contact marketing at patlink.com we can give you another free attempt to have one more chance to test for the pce so i think i already gone through the most important administrative issues so uh if you still have any questions that you do not know about uh you want to know more about the procedures or things that please lift the q and a you can answer in the chat or you can make the questions in the chat or ask in the q a we will answer your questions or in case that you are not a listen to the life you can still always our email to marketing at huffing.com and our team member will answer you shortly so thanks for joining again uh now i will pass the time to dennis and then he will go for another session too this will be a interesting session right yeah it it will be yeah um we had to do a lot thank you for inviting me cassie so my name is dennis hoefeins i'm the technical sales engineer from vital the distributor from germany and yeah let's see what we have to learn today we start with the session two now so i don't have to say a lot of this picture i think anybody knows what the public's mission is uh bright connectivity anytime in any way so to the speed fusion cloud what is the speed fusion cloud and what do i need for that for the speed fusion cloud of course i need a paddling device um you can use the speed fusion cloud only with firmware 8.1 or higher so you have to update your firmware if you can't see the speed fusion cloud icon in your in your gui nearly every public router is supported and yeah if you want to bond when you need more round connections um then you can use every feature um every cool feature for speedfusion cloud on this page has written two or more band connections and on the right side is the surf soho so it does not match hundred percent um this means you can use you so even for speedfusion cloud connection if you want to change your country or something else um or only for some tools but let's have a look how we can do the or what is the difference or why do we need it why should we need it with a traditional router even if you have more lines like here for example three lines with 20 megabits um then you have not really 60 megabits maybe you have but maybe you have not so some of our competitors um [Music] often talk about bonding and they say yeah we do bonding but if you look into the details you see they do not bond traffic they only do a load balancing a load balancing is on the paper maybe like a bonding if three persons are using the internet and everybody is using 20 megabits there then you have 60 megabits at all that's right but if one person needs maybe 50 megabits of bandwidth with one tool was one download or one stream for example then he cannot use it so there you have a look at the details and that's the big difference from pap link to other routers that we can bond the traffic to bond the traffic we need for example the speedfusion cloud with a speedfusion cloud we can do from three times 20 megabits to 60 megabits minus 19 if you are still awake in the last session then you know why we have the 19 have a look in session one then you know why um with the speed fusion cloud we can do all speed fusion features like band responding so this means we can combine multiple connections with different speeds or different kind of aligns or wind connections to bond this even we can do one smoothing and forward error correction over the speed fusion cloud we can use hot failover if we have completely different um connections then it doesn't make sense uh to bond everything then it maybe makes more sense to do a hot fade over between some different connections some different lines um yeah or you can only use it as an um as a vpn connection so you say it's a let's call it ipsec plus um because ipsec is on old connections like a dinosaur but we can do it modern and we can use the power of fairplaying the magic of public and use speed fusion um over an ipsec so we can do it easily and much easier so the difference between speed fusion and the normal ipsec we also learned in session one please i want to refer to the session one you can see it in the recording or on the slides so in the speedfusion cloud as i said we have one we can create an unbreakable connectivity easily so we don't need a additional hardware we only need our public router we can decide if we want to make our complete connection unbreakable or only some applications in this example google or zoom or something else or we can decide what we want to send in the speedfusion cloud and what we don't want to send in the speedfusion cloud at first is it complicated to set up the speed fusion cloud no it is not if we have updated to the latest firmware or to firmware 8.1 or or higher then you have the section here speed fusion cloud then for the first install you have to click on choose your cloud location oh it's not in the icon here if you set choose your cloud location we get a pull down menu in this pull down menu we can choose our yeah in our cloud location and which count we want to connect our speedfusion cloud after we have done that um we can set up for example some outbound policies outbound policies we also learned a lot in this in the session one um here we can see something about outbound policy for using wispy fusion cloud in this example we have set the domain netflix.com we want to create uh to cloud in seattle i think this is um so with an enforced rule this means everything to netflix.com will go over seattle why do we need that for example you have a customer on a boat or on a caravan on the boat it's more often and this customer is uh anywhere in some other countries um it's sometimes you receive the message from netflix or from amazon prime video but this video is not supported in your country and if i say okay let's go in my home country into the internet for netflix then i can see all my videos from my country because i have an american or in german or whatever ip to go into the internet and that's really cool and really easy to set up or if you want to set up yeah for in this example the customer is amazon in japan so everything to amazon japan will go over the speed fusion cloud in tokyo and we have set up and the speed fusion cloud connection one one and one two for in this example it's a priority rule this means at first we want to send all our traffic in the speed fusion cloud to tokyo and if the speedfusion cloud connection is not available because i don't know the udp is blocked however something happens then it will switch to one one and if one one is not available it will switch to one two automatically because it's a priority rule if you want that the traffic will be switched back automatically you have to enable terminate sessions on connection recovery this means if the speed fusion tunnel goes down we will send our traffic over one one and if the speed fusion tunnel goes back online then it will be uh the traffic will be switched back to the speedfusion cloud connection this is not only for speed fusion cloud this is for every connection you can set up here in the outbound rule so we can use it for vpn we can use it for traffic steering and we can give a bandwidth on demand for some devices this means we have for example the mbx we have a wi-fi here in a in a port we have a vsat connection we have on lte connection we have a 5g connection and everything of that is connected to the internet now we can connect it to the speedfusion cloud and we can decide what we want to do which of this alliance we want to bond which to go to the internet we can decide which device does he need for example here he has an apple iphone and he will use skype and youtube and goes over wi-fi to the mbx so we can create outbound rules for this isip and or you can combine it for the services like skype or youtube and say okay youtube should go over speedfusioncloud or not um this is really cool and easy also to do it for video conferencing um in in the in the last two years we had a lot of problems with this kovit so it was more important than before we have learned that everybody needs to be connected anywhere even if there's no connection no real good internet connection and if you do it in a car or really mobile for example we can use the max transit as a really cool device the max transit pro is much better than device than the old max friends do i love the max transit doom so if we want to do a zoom session with the max do normally we send connected to zoom and go over the lte lines or the one connection where the max transit is connected to and if we connect it to the speedfusion cloud then we can use band responding and we can use advanced smoothing that we are always online even if a line goes down so in this example we have two lte connections this lte connections are bonded to the speed fusion cloud i don't know uh how good is the connection in your country i can speak for germany or many countries in europe um there you have a lot of white spots we don't have a connection with some providers so you can drive with tim mobile it's quite good and in some areas you don't have connection with t-mobile though you have to switch to vodafone and sometimes you have no connection with vodafone when you have connect connect back to to t-mobile and if you do this while you are connected in the zoom meeting and you're switching your internet providers and your lines and your ips normally the zoom connection will break completely and to set it up easily let's do a bonding with t-mobile and vodafone for example you are connected to speed fusion cloud and the vodafone goes down here then it's down we use the traffic every traffic over t-mobile and if vodafone comes back we can use it so it's a really easy unbreakable connection without any new hardware and the device is also really small so and the speedfusion cloud is connected to the internet it's a absolutely stable connection so you have no problems you are always online there and yeah then you join over the internet into your zoom meeting of course without any interruption what is the difference between speedfusion cloud and fusionhub or maybe our physical public device um those are three possibilities so we don't need to use speed fusion cloud we also can set up a fusion hub or we can use a pad blank device as a vpn connection point as an end point for the vpn why do we have three different possibilities and well what are the pros and the cons for that uh it's really really easy uh let's start with speedfusion cloud because we talked a lot over speed fusion cloud now the speed fusion cloud is easy to set up um it only caused the the bandwidth or the the yeah the data usage you really need um you can have a look on padling.com you'll find uh all informations how expensive or not is speed fusion cloud and then you can buy for example one year with one terabyte of bandwidth and for the most um users this is more than enough and then you can use it really easy and if you need more then you can buy more on top and that's it and you need no additional hardware that's really cool you don't have to set up it in a data center or something else and you can host it by yourself and you can choose you change your cloud location as well you also can set up different cloud locations and that create outbound rules for different um applications you could for example you can say okay netflix.com has to exit and see it last we have seen pictures before and uh if i want to use amazon video i want to exit in maybe in australia i don't know so you have to you can select the speedfusion cloud endpoint really easy the fusion hub nearly does the same you the fusion hub is a virtual machine uh you can set up it in an esx server in an azure in an amazon web space or however and for one device the speech fusion up solo is for free you only have to pay for the space on the data center where you set up your um fusion app if you have in enough bandwidth or hardware at home you can set up your fusion hub at home of course and then you can easily create a connection to your home the difference is the next difference is you can set up the fusion hub more granularly that means you can set up in the fusion hub uh for example the latency difference uh or the cut off latency from each line and you can set up the um the suspension time after packet loss uh you can't do that with speed fusion cloud but you can do it with fusion hub so it's sometimes it makes sense to use a fusion hub but the fusion app is not a router so the fusion app is a virtual end point it's not a complete routing engine to do it if you need more routing possibilities in the in the background then you have to choose a public device with a pebbling device you can create more rules on it you can route your traffic to the different areas and yeah it's easier to do more about this uh so if you need a lot of routing with your vpn traffic go over the public device even you can combine it yeah you can combine some fusion hub some public devices and speed fusion cloud not you can't say this solution is the right one for you you always have to look which solution is the right one for you or for your customers so let's leave the routing thing let's go up to the sd switches since some years public is building sd switches and they are even better and better at the moment we have two lines the rug series the price series what is the big difference the big difference is the enterprise series um comes with integrate power sources with was written down power sources and not with dc power in and the enterprise switches normally use fans while the rugged switches don't use fans so the rug switches are looking a little bit like the mbx from the from the quality so really heavy really racked fanless so if you need it outside in in a car in a in a case or in the field anywhere then go for the for the rug device if you want to use it in an office around the enterprise maybe it's better for you so even the switch is completely different yeah as bigger the switch the higher the switching capacity also the operating temperature is a big difference so a normal switch will die if you will work on minus 40 degrees celsius yeah so but no problem for a rugged switch let's have a look on the ui on the ui it's really easy you don't have to configure it over a con command line over a shell like the cisco's it's really easy to do it on the on the dashboard and the dashboard looks like we know it from the public routers you can see the device informations here the power consumption uh everything as we know it from purpling so really easy and we have the real time connection and from connecting information so if you plug in a cable then um and it goes up the the connection it will light green and we see that it is up and yeah here we can see also our external connection we can click it uh to through the details button and then we see our port one is uh in the vlan 2 1 201 uh rapid spanning tree is activated but we have to forward it and the power over ethernet is disabled in the moment so it's really easy to have a first look and um if you don't do networks every day in your business it's a lot easier than do everything on the command line how to configure it it's easy and the net on to configure network settings we can easily create a new lan you see there are a lot of vlans created on this device so it's easy to do that we can give them a name give the vlan id we can also set this vlan as default vlan that's also really cool to make it easy and give it an ip address with a subnet mask and yeah we can activate interval and root routing on the layers researchers so really easy to do that and if you know a public router you can create uh you can configure the public switch without an extra extra three days of of teaching of course public as these switches also have has a spanning tree protocol included stp why should we activate spanning tree because banning tree is cool even especially if you have more than one switch included um then you can create some some rings and one spanning tree area will be blocked and if connection goes down a cable will be plugged out or something else then spanning tree is active and will go the other way so spanning tree is really cool to use but also if you use only one switch then we have you have to activate spanning tree not only with purple link maybe it was every other device as well because it will avoid uh loops for example because then spanning three protocols okay i have double connection to my root and then it will be blocked uh in the spanning tree bridge settings you can set a lot of things um yeah also this priority is one of the old questions in the pce tests i don't know if it's in the actual test also included in the pce 4.0 maybe you have to know the stp priority uh the loop protection on some other vendors it's only included if you use a spanning tree public has its own loop protection so you should activate it um why do we need it yeah it's if you have a company for example and there are a lot of network cables plugged out of the walls and some maybe some users say okay it's not enough for me and say plug in a really dumb cheap switch and plug in two network cables from two network connectors out of the wall uh it could be a loop and if you create a loop in a network a normal network will crash so please use salute protection if you have the chance to do it and of course the loop detect detection you can set it as fast as possible or you leave the settings from default um yeah then the network will recover by itself after it detected the the loop it means not only you have five sequence down five seconds downtime it will check every five seconds so if the check is gone and one or two seconds later the loop will be created then you have only three seconds lost but you can set it faster if you need it if you have really crazy users in your network the htp snooping is also a really really important feature it means only dhcp requests will be forwarded to trusted ports and only that means why do we need it normally our public router or our big router is our dhcp server or our we have our main dhcp server so it means only our dhtp server should send dhcp requests or should answer the http request to the client computers what will happen if i take my br1 activate the dhcp server go to a company i don't know to one company of you of your choice and i will plug in my lan connector to the network cable i plug the network cable out of a printer and plug it in my br1 lan port what will happen now easy my ba1 has an active dhcp server so every device what will boot it now or is asking for a new ip address maybe will arrive my bl1 and will receive an ip address from my br1 and of course my br1 is maybe not connected to the internet or is connected to a honeypot or i'm a hacker or i don't know what then i can see a lot of information from the devices but the normal network does not work as expected so no client computer can connect a server or something else though this can yeah cause really big problems though so in this case i have seen it in my life a lot of times so please if possible activate dhcp snooping this is a security feature okay maybe we germans are a little bit paranoid so um we do a lot of security but it's it's important to do it if you want to do a secure environment dhcp snooping has to be one of the parts the next thing we have to talk about is qs quality of service so we can create quality of service in our switches but why do we have dscp why do we have class of servers cus what is it and why can we choose it and easy if we do dscp it's in the header of the packets included it means it's a layer three head in the layer three header included and there we can set up the the the the fields uh for the applications or something else to clarify which applications which priority this is but a layer two device can't see that or some protocols like the spanning tree protocol is only a layer 2 protocol so you cannot create an sdscp information to a layer 2 protocol information so for that we have to use the class of service cos and on this page we can easily see or select which class of service should get which bandwidth and for dscp we can um set also the settings of on under the dhcp settings for that so this is really cool to do that and as you can see you can default um class of services and do we want to um yeah do we want to to to do a bandwidth limitation um for that or not of course this is only uh useful if you have fixed lines within fixed internet connection if you do that for an lte connection it won't work because uh lte has a lot of different um speeds so you have to then for that you have to check every second every few seconds um how big is my bandwidth and to check the the the the bandwidth completely you have to enable 100 percent of bandwidth and then there's no traffic possible so it's only really good to do that with fixed lines but with lte lines normally you don't need it but maybe it's it's useful for streamer for example to set the streaming packets in course zero and the other some things maybe with a limited bandwidth where i can say okay this is enough for that um yeah and there i can set the dsp um classifications i can set them into the um q uh quality um class of server settings so i can combine this together and i can name that of course that i know what kind of dsp field i have here so you have to read a lot to understand that and to learn that but once you understand it it's a really cool feature next thing is the access controllers the ingress access controllers this means we can create rules from [Music] to just to to set the vlans and to override the dscp things and you can do a lot of access control in here the next one is the port-based artic authentication 802 1x so this is really useful for secured environment in germany we have it really often for the big government companies uh hospitals uh nearly every company is doing a net nut in the moments on uh network access control and this is normally done with a radius server so we can set up our radius here and create the authentication of from the ports um on this area it means if i connect my notebook to a company where nack is active my device doesn't have the right certificates or i don't have a username there it depends on the authentication on the radio server and then the port does not go online um with some solutions um the administrator will send will get an email um with the with the text for example uh in in the first floor someone is hacking your um internet connect or your your network please have a look on switchboard 32 yeah when someone is going up there and finds a wrong computer in the network or wrong device this is also really important to make a secure environment port milling one second maybe you can sit your thoughts and i can drink a little piece of water so i'm back um [Music] sometimes i need a port mirroring why well if i use a packet analyzer to see what happens on some ports if i'm troubleshooting some something or i want to see what's up in my network completely then i have to use a network analyzer so a network administrator and a big company is doing that every day normally and for that you need to mirror your ports sometimes so you can set everything on part one will be sent also to port three it's a copy a complete copy and then i can analyze it um that the traffic what's what up there it's like the man in the middle are taking can play here um yeah it's easy to do that as you can see you say interface switchboard we choose switch port one here and say mirror port is traffic will be copied to ports 3. no because we set it up in the port mirroring section this is really cool and we can see it here important to do that in the port settings i can easily activate the loop protection or disable it because sometimes i have to disable it on some servers maybe um can set your things here with single clicks easily and with a good overview igmp snooping um it's also a security feature i also use it with the last 10 years i think or longer it means we can filter multicast from our network to make our network clearer if you have a big network with about i don't know 50 or 100 switches and thousands of computers then you have a lot of noise in the network and if your network is noisy it will make errors or it gets slow so we have to close our network for the things we need and everything else please should be outside of our network or of our devices who don't want to hear this unuseful noise so with igmp snooping we can filter the multicast for example sometimes we need the multicast when we don't have to enable it but as you see you can map which links need the multicast streams for each under others so you can create a multicast domain um yeah here you can see it was uh set to a pvid um for example and the default management vlan it's it's set here yeah you can create a lot of things in the port settings as we have pictures before in this example 14 and 16 are combined to a trunk or let's call it link link aggregation with a link aggregation we have one gigabit ports here so with two ports recommend was of two gigabits huh well it's like bench responding um only it's the standard and responding when you do it in tcp ip so you can connect a server with two network lines or maybe uh another peplink router to get a bigger downlink or uplink um to my core switch to get the the most powerful connection for example if you have an epx other core router and the epx has a [Music] 20 gigabit connection to the internet uh then it's not useful only go with one gigabit downlink to to our core switch or with a 10 gigabit uh sfp module then maybe we need two ports or two at 10 gig sfp modules and uh enable the trunk that we can use under 20 gigabit completely so and it's a security feature if one line goes down yeah everything is fine it will work um this are some external access settings that means um if we have to connect it to an uh usb modem or to an external setting then we can use it like a router a little bit that it gets an ip address and that our management vlan is accessible from from from outside i don't know how often you need it maybe you have to read a little bit more in the forum about this feature if you really need that but what you can need really often is um it's nearly the same only with the usb modem settings um yeah why do we need external access or usb modem if you are doing the the system for a company or the network systems and um any connection goes down i don't know what the firewall will crash the firewall is not in your hand and you can access remotely um over the usb modem more than external xs to come on the switch and the switch can talk to to in control and can give you any information about that so to do a remote administration or out of band management it's important that you have the external access and you can set plug-in usb modem a supported usb modem you can use the max adapter for example and then you can go online with your switch without an internet connection or you the management comes online not the users it's not a router it's a switch of course we talked about the radius server and the the authentication of the of the network access control here in the radio server settings we can set up our radius server and there we can configure multiple ready server profiles because maybe we have more than one so but enough on the on the management gui what can we see if we do that or what why do we that's a normal switch until now but now we do it um sd switches so um if i connected them the switches to our in control we also can see everything in in control and that's really cool if i have a switch like this in the port list and we see every device the device state the port state up or down which vlan it is which traffic will be sent over there and even exactly uh the power consumption from the power over ethernet and the power consumption with this pue is really important some persons have underrated this or i forgot the the power consumption completely um i have seen a lot of smoked um switches where it was in my old company there were a lot of cisco switches they have smoked um because they plugged in 15 or 20 access points um and yeah the access points took so much power that the switch um power supply was was smoked and or the main board and the switch died after that so um if you have if you use pue phones and access points and so on have a look at the complete power consumption and please have a little bit of spare in that because if you also you have to check it if what it's a power consumption from from a telephone or an access point if you boot it um or if you do a phone conference or you make some trouble on the access point only that you can see what is the maximum i can expect from this device and then you have to calculate the right switch with the right power consumption or you please connect less poe devices even you should switch off pve on the ports where you don't need poe normally why should should you do that because maybe a comp a crazy customer or crazy user will connect the device which is used which way poe is used and this can make you complete calculation to mess huh you have to think of a lot of things here in this example uh part one you see there's an ic2 icon in inside here that means on this lan port the switch is seeing in control so this seems to be our uplink where our management vlan is it in it and i would bet on the part one is the router connected um we had on the on the management gui on the first page of the switches we had clicked on part one and now it's part three um but what part one is written here okay it's clicked on part one so we can see it's our vlan id1 we see the traffic here we see everything but we have seen on the local gui um also but this is live in in control so you can manage it remotely and see all devices things remotely this is really cool and easy um you can edit the informations of course you can power the switchboard on and off you can switch the vlans to speed enable or disable power over ethernet spanning tree rapid spanning tree here you can do it within control easily you don't need to access the switch gui so you can do it a lot of switches without connected to them directly as i said you have to look in the power consumption within control it's much easier you can see it hourly daily or monthly you can see the power consumption so if the device is running a few weeks have a look into there and then you can see the peaks of this device and then you know okay my access point have a peak of maybe 10 but then i can calculate with 10 watts for all my access points and i'm fine also i can see the um vlan usage reports in control like you know it from the public routers um you can see here the reports upload downloads so the bandwidth consumption in the vlans that's also really cool to see what kind of vlans makes the most noise or the most more more traffic in my network um of course the event log is also in in control it's really easy to find something here or to download the event log that's a cool thing i don't i think i don't need to explain this um a lot of things because everybody knows what event look is so um here we see for example a vlan network which is created from stone at stone's demo device this is created in in control this is cool let's have an example we have a company with 50 switches and we need a new vlan for captive portal or for printers or whatever normally you need a really expensive software for the switches and maybe it works or maybe not um but you have to check it normally on every switch because in cisco and teresa's extreme all of those devices the management softwares are really bad of the of the normal components so um for that we can say okay we need a new vlan then we set this vlan captive eight please provide this to all our routers and switches we can also say we don't want to send it to all devices and switches we can say okay only where we have a special tag we can settings for switches especially and for routers and if we create this like this we save it and all our switches in our group will receive this new vlan and create this new new vlan automatically so you can create a vlan over 50 switches in less than 10 seconds and this is really cool and saves a lot of work because creating vlans on 50 switches is a job for a monkey but a monkey can't do it because he makes too many mistakes so the administrator the expensive network express administrator has to do jobs from a monkey and so in control will help us to do this jobs for us um [Music] yeah as i said the pap paddling switch can monitor remotely everything and we can turn on or off um the connected device because we can switch off um poe and then our phone goes off this means i have my business phone in my home office and if i stop working on six or seven o'clock in the evening i can disable power reasoning for my business phone and the business phone is off and no one will call me after i have stopped working or my kids can't use the phone and call my business contacts maybe so um easy to do that and with its troubleshooting and the vlan configuration so it's a really cool thing and public is calling that iot enabler so next step go back from the wires and go to wireless padling's wi-fi series is well known i think peplink has wi-fi devices longer than i'm a paddling administrator so but the last wi-fi series from public i have to say this is really really cool i have it in my own house at home i use the purplink ap1ax and i'm in this moment i'm connected over pablink ap1ax wi-fi i love this device so what can we do with pebbling combined with pep link or pep wave access points [Music] we can use a public router as a wireless lan controller so this means nearly every pebbling router every grown-up public router has an access point controller included though in this section we will cover the balance router vlc configurations all over settings over rp this means we have the access point controller in this example the balance 380 access access point controller is enabled here and we can push from the wireless controller our firmware for example to our access points we have to download it one time it's stored in the public router and if we have two or 50 access points we have only one download this saves bandwidth and makes a lot of speed combine it with many access points we can create guest vlans um with guest logins we can combine it with active captive portal and so on so maybe let's have a look how we can do something at first we have to enable the acceptance controller we go to ap and enable the access point controller you can set permitted ap to any or to approved list um i always set it to a proofed list you can do it with any of course but if you want to have a little bit more control as i said in the beginning the germans are part of the eat i don't want that anyone will install another ap and i don't know something from that i only allow it to the permitted access points and it's also a little bit of faster if i have the serial numbers of my access points into the list here otherwise the access point controller will wait on tcp and udp port 11 300 753 and for tcp 443 and then the they have in the field uh 138 and dhcp um the the access point called controller address included there so um yeah it's it's easier to do that but if you do it you don't have to think about it you don't need to know the the complete details uh you simply have to know if i plug in enter here my my serial number for my access point and it's connected to my public router wait a few seconds or minutes and then you can manage your device [Music] creating a wireless ssid for staff here so we choose our wireless ssid from the left menu click on new ssid button and then we have can create the ssid uh like here id settings dialog we enter the ssid name um that's an identical named identifier that you know what is this for if you have a a ship or you can also or a company you can also say it's my staff for my stuff for pep link there's others guests from pep link or something else that you know what is it for um then you can say what do i need for a security policy do i want to have vpa2 and vps3 or only this or only this of course as higher as good but uh some devices don't cannot use vps3 so if i uh enable vps3 and someone will access with an old device he has a problem so you have choose the highest security you are able to do we can also allow us to to use vpr enterprise and this for that we can use a separate radio server to handle the wireless networks authentication uh um after we have done that we click on okay uh at the bottom uh and that's it when we repeat it and do it for example with the guest ssid settings for guests we maybe have options for the encryption options for the guest maybe we say no open with no encryption maybe we want to do a captive portal over that later but the possibilities of the options you have in the security policy is open with no encryption vpa 3 vpa 2 and 3 only 2 personal or vpa 2 enterprise and vpa2 and vpa so vpa is normally not the choice and you can't leave it open it's the same um we can select some the guest ssid with open security here [Music] here we created it and set the security policy to open um here are in the in this where is it we have three sections at the same time [Music] [Music] normally i don't know what we want to do here but we can we can block the private ips and we can set the captive portal over this ssid that you're not that you don't need to to have a key or um the ssid key uh to to connect to the wi-fi um it's easy to come to that device and then the captive portal will have an overlay and then you have to authenticate so this is um really nice to have it in a restaurant in a hospitality or to make it professional the access point settings we can set different profiles for the access points or for the access point profiles for example if i use it for smart home maybe a lot of cheap smart home devices don't accept five gigahertz wi-fi then we can only enable 2.4 gigahertz here the operation country is also really really important because it's in some countries it's not allowed to send on some frequencies so if you do mistakes here maybe it could be expensive for you you can select your prefab frequency 2.5 for longer range or 5 gigahertz for higher throughput you can set the bandwidth of the channels and that's also for the for the for the performance settings but there are a lot of meanings on the forum what you have to set here maybe um you know it or you have to read it i don't want to give you uh my my opinion because i can understand everybody who says make it small as possible and the other say make it advised possible because it's faster it depends if you are in a rural area or if you are an area this operation country settings by the way um also take effect of the wi-fi ban settings so if you have some access if access point controller is enabled you can see it on the dashboard that you have five access points and online is only one but it's not a problem because there's no client connected if you see it in a live production system you had to be a little bit nervous because you have no clients and only one access point you lost four then we have to look so um if we go to the access point we see in the wireless ssid that this has been managed from our access point controller so we can not set it that's uh important and that's good for for that we don't want to set every access point by our hand because we want to save time and don't want to be some monkeys in the section access point controller ap status in this ap status we see the managed access points we see the serial number we see the mac address the location we can write by ourself and if we set it here in the details and there we have the firmware packs and we can change the access point profiles we created a few slides before to different access points we can select different access point profiles and that's really cool and even you can set here the correct firmware for the access points um you can set the firmware packs here um that's that's a nice thing though the controller status is really important um while setting up the access points or administrating the access points with an access point controller you have to click every section here to know everything about that so we can create a captive portal locally on the router we have two possibilities we can do captive portal on the public router or we can do captive portal within control if we do it locally on the router we can see the captive portal even if we don't have an internet connection maybe we need the captive portal to connect to an internal network and we don't want to have it with an internet connection then it's maybe quite good if you want to go to the internet i would choose the captive board from in controller so to set the captive port locally we have the host name we can set it as default and we can customize it and type our messages like enjoy your free wi-fi um we can set some files in there jpeg or gif files uh maybe we can set the landing page and especially in germany or europe don't forget the terms and conditions because you have to write it in there it could be expensive if you don't have it after that we want to connect our clients we have to look in our wi-fi settings um then we see the guest wi-fi and we see okay it's we are not connected we don't have we we failed the ping to google we faint the we want to ping our gateway we want to ping our access point and it will fail everything why is it like that maybe we have to um access our captive portal at first so we enter google.com here and we are redirected to the captive portal page we have set up in our patent router before and there we see our text we have written including our terms and conditions and first after we agreed this then we can ping to google we can ping our gateway um and we then everything is fine so we have to access uh to accept the the um the terms and conditions and click on agree in our captive portal and then we are online and we can really connect it to that in if you don't do it we are like a waiting queue so if we connect to the staff directly we see we connect to internet stuff we google we ping to google we ping our access points and everything we get an answer so it will pass the ping because there's no captive portal in there if you do this kept the portal settings with in control it's much easier you have a better graphical interface uh you can see more and you have a lot of lot more choices how the user can be connected uh on this you have seen the user only has to collect i agree and was connected um on in control you can say okay i can create some users you can i can create vouchers i can set it as a you can connect with your social media account or something else i think this is more secure and maybe much better to do that uh our german customers only normally only use the captive portal from in control as i see in the timer i'm a little bit too fast so we had a lot of feature updates um the last weeks and the last firmwares one of them is the wi-fi mesh support this is really cool with wifi mesh so you can connect your ap 1ax for example without a cable with your paddling router and it's the wi-fi will work so you can mesh the complete wi-fi system and if a line a cable goes down because anyone destroyed your cable with it with a drilling machine or something else um this device will be connected over wi-fi and will send uh your ssid and everything else and everything is fine and well it's a mesh system and it works really easy and is to set up really easy the open vpn client mode is also included in the new firmware you have to you need the the open vpn one license i think it's about uh it's 20 20 euros 20 dollars i don't know it's not it's not expensive but if you have it you can use the peppermint router as an open vpn client so the padling router can connect to a open vpn system and by the way the 20 euros or dollars public wants to have for this license is not much because but openvpn wants to have this money not paddling and yeah you can customize the van connections for this connection and of course you can use it in the outbound policies if you have an open vpn client mode active that you can decide which traffic has to be sent over the open vpn traffic so it's needed maybe for some companies they won't con don't want to switch completely to pep vpn or you have a migration from the openvpn connection to speedfusion for example then maybe you need it behind this router you can set up a normal speed fusion network and this is connected your openvpn to the company and then you can do a migration for example for this company to bring speed fusion in there the next thing is dhcp in the firewalls this is really cool so we can activate the packet inspection and we can filter the package with the dcp flex in the layer 3 header so sometimes some bad tools like viruses or something um i'm masquerading them behind some known ports and known ip's that you with a normal firewall rule you can only um check with the source what is the source ip what is the destination ip what is my source port what is my destination port and that's it but if a virus or something else is masquerading that or a hacker is masquerading that for example you can do a if you block ipsec out of my network because i don't want that my users can do ipsec to their home um i normally block the port 4500. so now some guys maybe say okay then i do ipsec with port 80 um internet connections over always opened so i don't have a problem this will work but if we do that with a dscp flag we can see her it looks like a normal http connection but it is an ipsec connection then i can block it so this is really cool and really easy and i also can use it in the outbound policies based on the dsp flag so it's a really cool feature to that many of our public partners and distributors had it on the wish list the van power over ethernet now it's available in the flex modules for example and can be activated there so this means i can use my public sdxpro for example and can connect a lot of hd1 domes outside and activate them with power over ethernet on the one side without additional hardware that's really cool that makes really sense and is nice for us we have new advanced settings in the rp interface so the rp is much more flexible and is growing more and more and more and you have to look in the rp settings or in the rp this is really nice what you can do for that remotely you can automate a lot of things here then um the 20x3 80x and 580x are now able to connect with the miniflex module um to a vdsl so we have a dsl modem or module for from public directly this is really nice we don't need a cheap or damp dsl module or router in front of our pap link this is really nice that we have it now thank you pablink the bigger cost customers with bigger networks and want to know everything what's up in my network so we have to look in our traffic and that is possible now with netflow we have not netflow supported uh with the latest version this is really nice and it's implemented in snmp so snmp is simple network management protocol please use snmp two or three because snmp1 is also known as security is not my problem but snmp is known and now we can collect and forward netflow data on our client from our clients this is really nice uh also we have the wi-fi um monitor support um it's really nice for troubleshooting or something else um maybe some of you know this uh devices from um the the the public air monitoring system we had um it was really nice to monitor everything from out of the air and to check if my wi-fi connection is still online so um the ap access point a hard support means mesh support we talked about this uh it's point 11 11 ac this is really nice so we have a red density here we have the air monitoring support and we can analyze it in control and we have the packet inspection um also on on the devices many devices on many devices we can enable a deep packet inspection but don't forget enabling the packet inspection means you increase the cpu power or cpu usage on your device so if you have a router and this is using 95 cpu power all the time don't please don't enable dpi because it will be too much but if you want to know more then you can do it um the drop-in mode is now supported for all routers so this is cool drop-in mode we have seen in session one the um ntp server unbreakable time server on on this page with this was a a wish always also from me up to pap link um now we are able to have one we can buy a beer one mini for example as a cheap device and then we have an enterprise grade ntp server which can set the time via gps via network from what was i don't know where with an absolute accurate time and for this price normally you don't get an ntp server in the professional in a professional network this is really really cool some in the hospital for example you have to to know everything about the complete um accurate time because if there's a time mismatch from a few minutes um you have a big problem if someone is dying and another system you have documented i have done some other stuff then you really get into trouble so um it's really important to have the um accurate time here so have a look at it and the local ntp server is really really cool and easy to set up even we have set up some test equipment or some demo stuff with public together to enable the tcp accelerator um this is cool we can speed up our speed fusion traffic because it's like an um acknowledged with spoofing yeah so for satellite connections we have normally thirty six hours uh six thirty six thousand kilometers uh one way connected so we have a round trip time from the package with the acknowledged bit from about eight 1.8 or 2.5 seconds and if we do it with tcp accelerator it reduce this time uh a lot so the the latency from the satellite connections will be much faster of course vpa three security features are included there this is really nice and also 82.11 v is supported for the wi-fi van settings so this is also nice that we have it this new features normally also are known questions and the tester we can look deeper in the traffic um we have to the the graphs in the speed fusion uh or in the van vanjavan connections on the devices this is really nice the dpi reports are upgraded in control so we can filter in the sub categories more more detailed more granary this is really nice and netflow we had it on the page before this is also nice that we have it so i think i have done it a little bit too fast um but we have done all the stuff now maybe some questions we can answer or hey thanks for yeah showing through the other slide with us although uh if you receive the slide you will discover some of the slides uh we did not go through uh in the in the webinar but during the test you can also refer uh when you have to test or you can get the box exam you can go back to the slide to see uh we since we still have some chance uh sometime if you want to ask the question on live please feel free to do this by this chance we will wait for five minutes before we end the session if there is no questions uh in this five minutes then maybe we will end up earlier today but if you have questions please feel free to and asset into a q a and then then this can help us to reply uh in real time response okay um yeah the ntp server feature i've written a question is available um in in in the in the latest firmware yes it is in 8.2 yeah i saw one questions from michael is asking will the slide be available i would say if you have already registered to this webinar and then you will receive the slide recording also the main exam uh dennis can you please help me to return back to a couple of slides about the main exam so when you receive the slide you can click on the mini mock exam yes yes yes so when you receive the slide then you click the start now and then you will go to a minimum can you please try to click and then let's see if you can shall i click oh you can try so when you click that and then suppose maybe it's jump to another you will go to a google phone later on you will see that so the google form will you will take the exam and then you will see immediately after the submit answer you will see if you can answer correctly or not if you are you can if you could answer all those correct then you can just directly go to training.papping.com to do the pca 4.0 if you cannot get all those correct i'll answer three then please go to our next wednesday session uh our tutor stone will help i will share with you what is the correct answer what is not and why then you will have more confidence to get your 4.0 exam okay so you will receive this recording and the follow-up email um [Music] later on tomorrow or yeah friday something sometime like this so yep i saw some questions here so i would pass the time to dennis again so rich is asking i use once music for live streaming over three connections on normal mode if i do a zoom call or a webinar this stream will go over all three connections no problem but if i do the same with the rtmp stream once music only uses one connection instead of three why is this normally you also use uh you all three connections it depends on the hardware or maybe you have a subtotal um in there created i don't know um but rtmp also no normal represent over all lines and the advanced museum will be enabled there as well so we do it every day and it's it works i don't know maybe you have to open a ticket that you have to look in detail or normally it shouldn't be a problem um christian no the mock exam is not live here it's next week live with stone here um i have clicked on this but it opened in my in a second window and um yeah maybe everybody wants to see the questions um on on his own desk uh with his own mail account so you have to do it by yourself and uh stone will are talking with with you about that in the next webinar next week yeah so no hurry because you will receive the multi-sampling uh tomorrow or the day after tomorrow you will receive the email just like what the last uh recording last webinar follow-up email so please wait until one or two days we will send you to link don't worry you will receive the email and then you will see oops this link um and then you can click on start now and then you can do your mac mock tests and then you feel free um to check your knowledge [Laughter] how about the license if sd switch and enterprise is a package including license i don't know what you mean um charisma um if you receive the sd switch and then yeah you have all features included there are no additional licenses as i know from public this device is working and a multi-cloud setup the multi-cloud setup i think you mean is to to install multiple speed fusion clouds yeah then you can set up the install the next speed fusion cloud if you want and then you can create outbound policies from the traffic to say okay traffic netflix should go over speed fusion cloud a and traffic amazon prime video should go over um speed fusion cloud b for example this has done an outbound policy but you can create multiple um [Music] speed fusion cloud connections even you can say okay let's always choose the nearest speed fusion cloud connection for this guys who are traveling very very very many times or many many miles or kilometers then you can let this router choose the nearest cloud connection for you so which roaming protocols to public apps have what do you mean with the roaming protocol i don't know what what you mean here i i can uh if you want to do to know the details about the different protocols and something else um i always say please check the public forum the paperlink forum is one of the best forums you have ever seen in the network hardware normally you don't get the answer like you are dumb or sorry reboot your system or make a firmware update or something else in the public forum everybody will help you um if someone says to you make a firmware update or reboot your device then it's because it will solve the issue and some not not for the else and um you also find a lot of documentations in the paperlink forum so please have a look at forum.pappling.com you find the most answers you have there and it's also important to do it for the test i think you cannot make the test without the purim forum you can do it but then you are absolute peppering specialist like stone or maybe me oh i have to scroll is the news on the rvs transit gateway connect any comments on this or any customers have started using i don't know it over the amazon transit gateway i have read something um but i i'm i'm only only a distributor so i'm not paddling by myself i don't give can't give you an answer about that maybe stone can answer the question from someone or don't have to ask maybe as well because there are many developers at public working on this project let me give you some updates on the amazon transit gateway actually uh we have already do a lot of cooperation with amazon transit amazon team so you can yeah now you go to that um just like what the question is uh we go to public.com and then search for amazon transit gateway connect then you will see uh we have the whole page on saying that what is the transit gateway and also the installation guide so the answer is we're already okay to use uh the uh we already uh paddling already it's already ready on the transit gateway connections and then you can use this surface with uh on on the collected official website and then you can install the installation guide and we also have a transparency on this yep dennis you can go for the next question yes i'm scrolling can purple and people see the gps location information of our pap link mobile device no the in control system is your in control system so pap link has no access into your group or to your gps device or something else it's a management software for you and so it's absolutely secret and if you don't want to use gps in germany sometimes it's not allowed because of uh monitoring some some employees or something else then simply disconnect the gps cable and that's it then gps is not active but pap link cannot see it they only can see the gps location if you enable for example the the remote excess for public the pebbling system yes peppling people no the same is for your data so still scrolling okay i think we don't have new questions here then yes thanks so much for then it's helping us to holding this weapon now so yeah let's give a big hand to him yeah i'm sorry for being too fast but yeah i think we still have one more session in case you don't uh have you have questions not included not related to the more exam you can still ask for some things that when you go to vision on that so thanks very much for uh joining us and then yeah we will see you uh see you again next wednesday so uh once again thanks very much for and it's helping us to be our training speaker so if you are in germany and then you want to have more uh technical support or technical things or business opportunity you want to work out with our value at the distributor in germany then please contact us and then we will forward your lead to that to the company so uh we were off after one minute thanks so much for everyone joining thank you okay bye bye bye thank you for listening bye you"}

training today this training will become we'll have a three session today is the first session and we invited our germany uh vad partners he is our certified trainer that is uh to be our trainer or speaker for today webinar thanks for your time today dennis so i now pass your time to you yeah please um yeah share this slide and share your knowledge with the community thank you so thank you cassie yeah my name is dennis i'm the technical sales engineer from retail germany the distributor for public in europe so um and i'm happy to bring you a little bit more with the new pce 4.0 training and i hope you will learn a lot and in the next sessions you learn some more stuff so it's really uh a lot to do and uh yeah if you have any questions feel free to ask yeah give me one uh remark is today we will cover a lot of things but this is not we will not cover 100 or everything so we will share with you the slide uh this slide will have more supplementary knowledge on that so today we will just go through some important things and then this will share with you about the examination technique or things in case during the examination you can refer to our slide for uh for revision and also for finding the answer so this is uh the key if you have any questions then please uh down here and then we in the third session um after two weeks uh we will have to we'll have stone be our trainer to answer all of the additional questions together so sorry dennis you can go on now no problem so then um let's start i think public is known from everybody because it's a certified engineer meeting so i think i don't need to talk about the basics um yeah what do we do today um we look about the sd-wan the speed fusion configuration or some products um features and so on but the most important thing i think is what have you do to do the pebbling certified engineer what is it um we have two certification tracks one is the technical support engineer and the sales engineer so pce and p per um coupling certified sales specialist for the coupling certified engineer we need a lot of technical know-how um peplink has created additional paths for training so it will this will be aimed at certain veteran vertical markets um all candidates wanted to gain certification in particular market track must be already taken and past the pce you are not limited on the amount of certifications you can undertake a lot of candidates currently hold both the pce and the pcss certification you can do both the pce and the pcss the first training track under the pce is for the maritime market and what we do today is the pce overall not in the vertical zone we have to learn everything so yeah let's go on um what have you do in the to to get the pc we do the multiple choice exam we have to understand nearly everything about power blank we need to know something about sd-wan about the paplank vpns diffusion technology about the the hardware from purple link pep wave and pepsim uh we need to know about the cloud-based networking in control fusion hub the private hosted in control and so on you have to do 50 questions and you have 100 minutes time so two minutes for each questions this will hold two years and you have to know 70 percent so i think it's doable normally it costs 150 or euros and as i know if you are in this session it's for free for you so how can we do that at first you have to visit the training website on training.babling.com your register there and then you can enter the course after that you do the the certification exam and yeah if you begin it you have 100 minutes time to complete it so prepare you well and then it's really doable uh yeah here are some slides how to do it exactly i think i don't need to clarify how to log in what you have to learn to do a positive test you have to look at the training documentations of the webinars from the old webinars and i think in the future this webinar is also on the list you need the pep link website you need the release notes maybe the latest and maybe some older and you need a forum and yeah if you have access to everything yeah you have the big chance to do it here are some example tests from the mock test some example questions like what are the routing protocols supported by the balance and max family how can we find the solution here at first we have to look in the pap link manual then we find the routine protocols and we find the right answer so in this example a d and e was right but the most important is not not the right other important things here is how to find the right answer now you don't need to know everything it's enough if you know where you find it um also you can find it on the public website here on the section networking you also find the right answer so some different ways to find it the next question from the mock test is what is the sizing criteria to choose the right fusion hub yeah also easy i would look on the website and then we find the difference from the fusion app and you see yeah number a was correct so the pep link homepage gives us the solution here and which situation is kept the portal applied to an ssid instead of a vlan huh nice questions this would be a question for the pep link forum and in the public forum you find a lot of answers here and after you find it you also know what is right here in this example choose a statement that is correct describe how the outbound policy rules are executed you have to choose two so the next is have a look at the forum and in the forum you find the presentations and in this presentation from public you will find the correct answer uh for here that you can have to enable the expert mode for example so this was important that you know you have to look in different spaces and different locations to find the answers for the questions sometimes they are really hard to understand especially if you are not a native speaker like us in germany but if you look at the forum and uh all the slides and presentations um then it's it's it's really good to to to do everything and find everything so the next thing is the public core technologies like in control and speed fusion of course all the enterprise features let's start with speed fusions what do we need to do speed fusion we need at least two padling routers now two routers which can do speed fusion or help vpn uh the difference we see later and if we have two devices then we can set up of course a vpat vpn with a speedfusion tunnel or something else and we have um different configuration types like point-to-point mesh but i think the most is easy for you you know i think the most things by yourself the security is a big thing especially in the moment uh what does how is the security working was paddling is it really secure or is it not um it is we have pap link is using a 256 bit aes encryption so on every single line on every single line that will do a key exchange with diffie-hellman protocols and will encrypt each line with an own key so as more lines as you have more lte lines or cable lines or something else as more the security will raise up and the sample on the right side you see a pebbling router with four one connections and on the other side a router with three one connections so we have 12 sets of encryption keys we have 12 aes encrypted lines if someone will do a man in the middle attack here he can't find everything he can find maybe fragmented informations from augmented encrypted informations and even if someone can hack the 256-bit security level which is hard then he can't do anything with that because those are only some fragments in the wrong order so he has nothing so if you want to do a really secure installation please use as much lines as you have but to do this you have to open maybe some firewall ports in some regions um udp for example is blocked from the government or from some providers then you have changed it or if you are behind a firewall it's important that you have to open the triple reports for speed fusion the typical ports every pce has to know in sleep is tcp port 32 0 15 and udp 4500 this are the most important ports every pce has to know it while you're sleeping if you do more tunnels with sub tunnels on something else it will count up or if you're using ipsec or l2tp then maybe 4500 is occupied then you have to do use the next port or speedfusion will change to udp 32 15 automatically um but i can recommend to do a small range and to open the firewall at first if you see speed fusion is not working the first look is about the tcp and udp ports of course you can use custom ports if needed then it's not a standard installation but you can do it that's really um really interesting and if you're using multiple tunnels as i said then the udp ports will count up so it's 4 500 for the first tunnel and 4 500 one for the second tunnel so on the on the headquarter where the fusion hub is for example you have to give up a range in the firewall that everything will work the next we'd see is as i said what is the difference between pap vpn and the other things the basic of our ispac vpn is like an ipsec connection but with the magic of pap link it's easier to do and it's much better we see it later and you have much more features on it every pep link device every peplink root router can do pep vpn or even the surf soho the first step we can add is hot failover so hot fill over means we can switch the lines without interruption of the pep vpn the next is one smoothing of and forward error collection so we can duplicate or receive our protocols or our packets if we have some loss on the lines with a bad internet connection or something else but we see it later in detail and the top of the pyramid is the band responding so with the band responding we can combine all our lines to a bigger bandwidth more security and that's the install and forget solution so if we do bandwidth bonding then everything will be connected every time and it's nearly not possible to interrupt this you have to power off your router so what is the difference with band responding we can combine the speed and bandwidth of multiple van connections or cellular connections so we do it on a packet level but it means we do our tcp stream and put it in some smaller pieces and send it out on all other lines and we'll build it together on the other side of the tunnel with the bandwidth overflow we can make one line full and then we use the other line so we can use all lines we have was nearly hundred percent um but it's not completely bonded then with one smoothing as i said we can do a create a jitter-free and uninterrupted connections it's really important for the the media broadcasting area there you need advanced music the hot file over if one line goes down it will switch automatically to the other line and your session is always online so in the detail here you see the heart fell over is for small offices long distance ethernet retail connectivity sometimes if you do a switch and the hot fellow you have to press f5 for example that your website is loading again because you change your ip address and something else but you are online but not uninterruptable or maybe sometimes not interruptable you have to choose really do you need hot failover or do i need some other stuff but it's really reliable reliable and the bandwidth will not be increased so how it works yeah as i said uh if someone line goes down it will switch to another line automatically um you don't need to do anything it will work really fine and some in this example cellulise and stand by if mpls and dsl goes down cellular will wake up and the data will go through the cellular automatically without any um manual doing from the administrator the advanced missing as i said is really important for voice of ip video conference conferencing tv and radio broadcasts [Music] for tv it's it's really easy to to explain if you do a video broadcast and you see packet loss you will see it in the picture the picture is stalking you see some brick wall effects in the pictures uh that's not nice and if you do one smoothing we can duplicate or triplicate uh or quite as many lines as i have the packets and then the first package will what received on the on the master side this will be taken and the other packets will be removed so we duplicate or triplicate our um our usage on the line it will slower of course but it will be much more real reliable it's really really important to do that sometimes i don't need the big bandwidth but i need every data packet then while smoothing is your choice yeah i explained it on the first picture of course you can duplicate it with the medium and then you have every data package on double side so we have zero interruption and no delay it will be an absolutely stable connections but the bandwidth consumption is at least two times of the original traffic if you switch to medium it's three times or high it's four times and if you switch it to maximum then it will be as many lines as you have also if you have only one line you can use one smoothing and sent on the same line every data package doubles so this is important if you have a router or internet connection with a lot of packet loss then it's better for me to send everything uh doubles um before i wait um until the the acknowledged bit does not will be received or in udp traffic i will never notice that the traffics don't receive my my my destination so this means if you have like this road with a lot of holes in there once moosing make it really smooth so then you can drive without any interruption or any problems and yeah so this is really good to know the other way that we can use is the forward error correction the forward error correction is like um doing a a rate system with with a hard disk you have parity bits and you can resist reserve packets like the parity bits on the rate on the under on the on the hard disk you can interpolate the packets they are lost on the line this is really cool for a one-way video connection for two ways you have to use once music but when the one way it's a really cool thing to do that it's like srt a little bit in the video streaming but this is for network protocols so you can use it not only for video files you can use it for everything this is really nice and it has a little bit less bandwidth consumption so you have 13 in the normal setting on and i think 26 and the high uh settings so for smaller bandwidth it's the way to go you have to choose it and you have to test it if it's enough then it's good and if it's not enough you have to go with bandwidth uh but it's just once losing if we use bandwidth bonding that's what i said it's a install and forget solution you can replace eg mpls for that because you have more bandwidth it's cheaper it's real reliable and it's always online it's working hand in hand with hot wheel over and pep vpn you can build a fat tunnel pipe with all connections you have you can use it as a multivarn line and it will be it provides us a single super fast tunnel so this is what you cannot do with ipsec you need speed fusion for that because you build up a single vpn connection over every line but it's it looks like one really big pipe uh that's really cool to do also you can do is a layer two tunneling over this with the layer 2 it's like a really long natural cable you can for example be in new zealand and the other side is in germany and you build a layer 2 connection and you have the same local ip addresses and yeah it's it's like you are in the same network without any routing without any hops and that's a really cool solution you can do with that so it's easy it's it's easy scalable and if you need more banters yeah then plug in a new line and plug it in the tunnel and and that's it that's really really really cool um [Music] yeah on the next line this is the same i talked about like every time um you can establish a tunnel over all active links and you think as you can see here you the data package are on parallel on each line and will be plugged together and ordered in the right direction on the destination and the user will receive the package as the camera has sent in this picture so it's really nearly uninterruptable also if there's a hot fade over while we hit transmit data we don't get it it will be automatically sent again on the other line and that's it so you can set it to check the line extremely then it will check all lines within sub seconds and that's really nice so it's fast but if we use speed fusion we have a little bit of overhead of course a normal ipsec has an overhead from 16 and in this case you see the imix we have to add some special headers on it some bytes that the header will be packed on the header of the packets because we have to reorder the packets uh on the other side we have to know which packet has which number and that's not basic in any vpn connection though that's why we have a little bit more overhead it means the the data is will be encapsulated in a special link udp stream uh and in this udp stream these header is a additional 80 bytes so this means we have an overhead from about 19 percent and with ipsec we have 14.6 overhead so we have only 4.4 more overhead compared to ipsec but with all the features we have from from the speedfusion tunnel so it is really the way to go how can we calculate it we have a 10 download to make upload line to two pieces of that and on the other side we have 100 mbits synchron line so it does not mean you have 20 megabits download and 4 megabits upload it means you have nearly the 20 percent 19 so you have 16 megabit upload and 13 megabits 60 megabits download and 3 megabits upload in the overall and that's really cool so you have to calculate it sometimes maybe it's good to bond it and if the lines are too different you will make the lines slower with this standard bonding setting then if you do it otherwise you have to change it to dynamic weighted bonding then you also can generate more bandwidth with different lines so if the lines are really different please choose a dynamic weighted bonding to make it as secure as you can do um you have to use at least two different isps um maybe also different services like cellular cable connections fiber connection then you are safe if someone is digging your cable out of the of the or out of the floor then you are always online if we compare that to an mpls line we will save really a lot of money uh i don't know how the coast and for mpls are in other countries in germany mpls is really really expensive so if you have a big company and they're using mpls many companies can save so much money but all paperlink hardware is included in the price in lower than one year so in 10 months you have spared so much money that you nearly earn money was because you're using pap link that's that's really cool huh what is the difference to ipsec um many of our other guys using ipsec and they don't trust speed fusion or paddling because they don't know it with ipsec yeah we have also 256 bit aes encryption but that's the same the only thing what is the same an ipsec it's not really easy to install or to to look if someone is not working as expected and if you want to do it encrypted over more than two or three locations you need to be a really hard expert and ipsec doing and if you do want to do a hot fellow then feel free but i don't want to do it anymore because i know pep link now was a pap link you have to can do it in a few seconds so it's with with the pep vpn it's easy it's also for dynamic ip environments if you don't have a fixed ip address yeah it doesn't care or we can do it um the hot failover is easy and the one smoothing as we talked about really okay and of course the band responding is the king of all so i said it's easy to do how to do it we have two ways one way the easiest way is to do it within control if we opening control we click on path vpn set on configuration and then we can do a configuration over over multiple groups or not manage i in control manage devices or for the whole group we can change a choose between fully meshed hub and spoke point to point and yeah that's it if we configure it then we say okay configuration add profile in this example we want to do a star we choose our devices which i p address the ipaddress will be filled in automatically because in control knows the ip address sometimes you can see more than one ip address if it's an ip address you can reach from the outside it's perfect if it's an ip address from the inside because the device for example behind the firewall please remove this ip address and then choose your endpoint device click on next and that's it if you do it with polymeshed you can choose in the first step multiple devices and then you build a connection from each device to each other so you both yeah fully meshed and on point to point it's for two devices so device a to device b in this we can set some different things we have here for example the disaster recovery disaster recovery means what happens if this device is not available because the line is down the device is down however you can set a disaster hub that the tunnel will be built to the other device if this is down here so it means you have to be always online also if someone happens you can set the link and advance settings if you click on the advanced link settings you can choose the coast for the different lines you can choose will it be used only to to which connection it will be used and in the advanced advanced settings you can set do i want to do it in which priority and do i want to use it only for upstream downstream or both maybe some connections are really good for downstream but bad for upstream then you can use it only for downstream and you can choose also the remote one because sometimes it could be possible that you can reach something over an external line something over an internal line then you can choose it and set the setup like as you need it so it's very flexible to do everything as you need if you are ready please don't make the mistake i do every day i forget to click on save so please click on save if you don't do that this configuration will be saved on the devices and the tunnel will be set up if it's safe you see it on the green lines that the tunnel is online and everything is fine so we can see it in the normal location the logical location so you see the balloons that everything is online the devices online and the tunnel is online or you can see it in the in the map like gps based you can see really where are the devices located is everything green and everything fine as expected so it's also included monitoring system for vpn tunnels if you do it locally you have to know one more thing it's the local id and remote the remote id the local id of your device is the remote idea id on the other device so local id will be needed on the other device and yeah and otherwise so at first you can save it or you can give a name it's up to you then you click on new profile you can click on the profile and set everything it's identical to the settings in the um in in control and after you saved it it's ready and if you want to send all the traffic op in the vpn tunnel this is really important it's like a routing from 0.0.0.0 over vpn then you select this the sign and set send all traffic to choose your profile name and then you have to enter two dns servers in this example those are the google dns servers and that's it on the left side you see the link failure detection time that's also really important how fast should the system monitor all your available lines in standard it's about 15 second seconds and if you need more example for video streaming you can set it to extreme when it's in in some milliseconds it will check every line uh of course it takes a little bit more bandwidth but it's more reliable if we need to change the handshake port please click on the question mark under the help icon click on the here and then you can set a custom port by default it's tcp 32015 of course some slides before i said you had to know this in your dreams the link failure detection time okay i was too fast yeah so here we can see the local configuration from the pap vpn at first we said a profile name please choose a name that you know what you are doing here and the remote id you have to enter the local id of the other peer and the pre-shared key is a key of your choice though you can write something like i don't know what to enter here and if you write it on both sides it's the same password it's like a password but it needs to be the same password on both sides the remote ip address you only need on one side um normally you do it on the side for cellular lines or something else not on the headquarter site if you don't have a fixed ip address on your other side you can also write a name like the dundee and s name or something else then you can see you can change choose here one smoothing forward error correction and so on and you can set the one connection priority so for example we say okay we need um we are on a boat and we need cellular connections with high highest priority and the van connection for that light is the lower connect priority then we set it to priority two for example the nut mode if we select the nut mode um yeah i don't need to read the whole text but you can activate nut for this device in this tunnel that yeah it has to be the network address translation will be enabled in the tunnel the coasts is really interesting if we want to set up different coasts we can do really cool scenarios it's like in the rapid spanning tree but this is not a rapid spanning tree it's ospf and the ospf will go over the cheapest way so in this example we see there's a coast from 10 between b and c is also coast of 10 and the c to a it's a cost of 30. so if c wants to send data from c to to a it will be go over b to a because the way from c to b is 10 from b to a is 10 though it goes completely 20 and the shortest way will be cost 30 so it will be go to cheapest way with 20. with this coast you can set up different rules to to [Music] configure where that data has to go here we can set up in the tunnel the other was out of the tunnel the data port is in the tunnel we can set the specify the udp port away from 4500 or 32 0015 if this port eg is used from other stuff if you are in a country where udp is not allowed or is blocked or maybe the company wants that doesn't want to use udp you also can change it to tcp um it's i don't know how long it it's written as experimental i know it will work we have done it a lot of times and it's working really really good of course udp tcp needs always other acknowledged bit udp doesn't need it so tcp is maybe a little bit slower than udp but it's important to know where to set this and that it's possible to set this the packet fragmentation it's normally we don't need it but sometimes we do some devices or some we have to start earlier uh in the speed fusion the mtu size is that uh 1360. some devices have a hard set mtu size of maybe 14 000. 1400 if it's hard set then it will be fragmentated so we can set the the f flag the don't fragment flag um or we don't want to do that so you have to choose do we need this do we want to fragment packets or not that's the most important thing normally you don't need it but it's interesting to know that we have it for example if you don't want to fragment the the bits or then you can't send packages which are bigger um if you if you do an srt stream for example and you don't set this or you you have set this um the srt won't receive um won't go through it because um srt stream is bigger from the mtu size so then you have to fragment it then you have to set it to always you don't need the df flick let's have a look onto in control we have two management options first of it it's the in control everybody knows it's in control two.publink.com it's the pap link hosted in control if you set up an organization you are the administrator the organization administrator in this organization you can set up a lot of group admins that means you can for example if you have your own conf in control you can say okay customer a is group a and the admins are the i.t guys of this company in group b those admins are the id guys of this and something else you can enter every group and in this groups there are the devices so you have the group level the organization level and the device level and you can configure different things on the different organization levels or in control levels if you have a private hosted in control it's nearly the same but you have one step before you have the msp administrator the msp administrator so the managed service provider administrator who's hosting this in control also has access to all organizations and he has to allow for example the devices the firmwares and something else and the public hosted public is doing that for you but you can use it for your own installation if needed so we see we have a lot of features we can do with in control like the bike configurator with zero touch configuration so we can use for zero such configuration we can use the bike configurator the remote that device ip configuration we can do it over the excel file for example and set the ip addresses uh we can set outbound policy for every device the central fireball configuration this is really really interesting and in the time of this actual time in germany many companies are scared or afraid because they don't want to be hacked from some bad countries and so you can block some countries country based ip addresses so you can say okay i p addresses from country a i don't want to get in my network i can block some inbound and outpound completely we can do the centralized firmware management that means we can do firmware updates from in control side we can update complete groups we can do it geo fencing we can do it by time or something else we can set ssids remotely and of course one of the cool features is the captive portal we can do it easy customized capture portal for all devices let's go into the details what is an outbound policy an outbound policy means we have to root the traffic the device or the way of the traffic some devices has to send in this example we see some different colors you can see this computer will go out over one one the mobile will go out over one two and the camera will go out over one three why is this or why are the devices choosing this way because we can configure it this is really important you use it nearly every day the eight outbound load balancing algorithms so at first we start with the outbound policies uh in the basic in the outbound policies we can add a custom rule we can if we set them we can drag and drop them into the top or on the bottom um always the the rules on the top will be will be the first rules we will be choosing and on the bottom these are the last rules if you don't need some rules you can click on the x and it will be deleted so let's have a look in the in the different outbound policies the weighted balance it means it assigns more traffic to a faster link or less traffic to a connection with a bandwidth cap you can set a weight on the scale of for each connection and outgoing traffic will be proportionally distributed according to the specific ratio this means you can send a percentage line for each carrier if you can set example in this example um of a public balance 310 you can set one one to ten one two to ten and one three two five so this means the total weight is 25 and it means oops sorry too fast this means one one is forty percent one two is forty percent and one three is twenty percent and then everything will be rooted uh will be filled up to the different usage here you can see this example here so it's it's really easy with those with some points to set up and to the left or to the right and then you can set the different weights of the van links and this will be used like this the priority rule this is what i use mostly with this there you can route the traffic to the preferred link as long it is available so it means if we set the carrier one with the highest priority we will send every traffic over carrier one if carrier 1 goes down all traffic will be sent over carrier 2. if carrier 1 will come back after it will be repaired then the traffic will go back to the carrier 1. this feature is really old i think it's starting from firmware 5.2 or something else it's it's really a nice feature and it will be used really often you can also set in the priority use the vpn connections so there's a question do we need to request for recording uh okay i think it was to this pink point no it was not so um the vp you can also set the vpn into this priority rule this means you can set for example different vpn connections and set the outbound policy go place everything over the ppn headquarter one and if vpn headquartered two years one is not available use the vpn headquarter ii and if this is also not available please don't use the vpn then we want to go out over over our van lines and that's really cool to set up [Music] so if we do it in an enforced connection that means we want to fix some traffic we don't want to set it maybe for every traffic but maybe for some special traffic or from special ip addresses we can send okay we can say okay all my traffic from the camera should always go out over carrier one and the others doesn't care you can decide which traffic has to go out on which line then you can say choose it like that you can also say okay every this traffic maybe you have some internal traffic from your um [Music] data system like your warehouse system then you want to have this data unencrypted in the internet then you can say from this devices everything has to be sent over the vpn and nothing else or in this example it says smtp traffic to a specific van link because maybe the mail server is only available on this one line so it means with priority and enforced with this pose you can also use the vpn connection and the others not um so in the others you have only the physical one lines yeah this is good to know only vpn only for priority and enforced and the others you can only choose the normal van lines for example the overflow what is the overflow the overflow means okay let's do let's fill up carrier one at first if carrier one has nearly hundred percent of bandwidth congested then we switch back to carrier two we send the next traffic to carrier two and if this has hundred percent we go to carrier three and so on so we can fill up the right the lines uh one after the other maybe you have some different contracts where you have to pay for each gigabyte it should be possible that someone something like this is existing the lowest latency is also really important with the lowest latency connection you send always this traffic to this line what has the lowest latency into the internet so to the google server for example we we can measure with carrier one in this example we have 40 milliseconds to google and with carry 2 we have 30 and with calories 3 we have only 20 milliseconds so carrier 3 is the fastest so every traffic will be sent over carrier 3. and it's a pretty predefined time interval where the where the speed check checks will be done from public automatically and the fastest line will be chosen but it's the fastest line to the internet now we have three different outcome policies overflow we had it means overflow let's fill up one line lowest latency we also had um on the last page it means okay we go to the fastest to the fastest internet connection and least used means we want to use every line um like a fair use policy then please split your data and we say okay um march 3 has not enough bandwidth consumption then we sent the rest on one three that um yeah it was least used so yeah it's it's the the the link was the most available bandwidth uh maybe you have a contract with like a cellular contract and you have only 100 gigabyte or 50 gigabyte on each cellular line then it's important to fill up each basic contract bandwidth before we have to pay extra money so there's a question to this regarding overflow if you defend a speed for one one let's say 100 megabits and for any reason the provider gets 50 meg which will the system take construction of the one and fifty megawatts uh if you set the one speed manually um we don't send it faster than this if only 50 megabits is available then we use only 50 megabits so if we aggregate two one connections then we can't use this because if we aggregate to one connection to a band responding um then we can have to choose between priority and enforced uh because in the tunnel we can't you can cannot use the lowest latency uh in this time maybe it's in a future release i don't know so that persistence connection means we all we want to to prevent the traffic from slowing down so we can say okay this traffic will always be on this line and it should be a persistent connection of course um the name says everything to that yeah you also can choose it by drag and drop and can set the distribution rate here and of course it means if you have a https session or something where you have an a special id you don't want to change your line in the hot like and hot fill over every time then you we need to to do it persistence and we say okay we have one connection maybe to my um google mail account and if i have to change if the public will change me from one one two one two my ip address will change then i have to press f5 that i i'm online again and then for that we need to do it persistently if possible and you can say by destination or by source of course and that's also sometimes really important that the connections will that you have a seamless connection everything is working as expected so fastest response time it's really interesting it's like the lowest latency but one step more the lowest latency is only into the internet and the fastest response time is the complete way to our destination so it could be possible that i go over carrier three in this example we go maybe with a oversea cable and then from the internet to our destination or headquarter it's too slow and that means we can measure it every hop and can select always the fastest line from local network to our destination so in this example we want to restrict an ipsec traffic to vanvon you see the name is a name where you can know what you have done there so please always take good names um to configure the public balance to restrict ipsec vpn traffic to one one add the following service and force rules at first we specify the rule we do a service name we say okay any source to any destination because we don't care the destination maybe we can set the destination ip address but maybe not and we say okay our point to to know that this is a vpn connection it is udp port 500 so we select port udp 500 to do that and then we say okay it should be an enforced rule and we want to send it over one one this means if i have a traffic with port 500 every time one one will be used on the right side it's the same we do it for port 4500 with this two ports um udp will be rooted over one one why don't do you do two ports easy because you need to to do a ipsec vpn with nut t that requires udp ports 500 and 4500 so if you have to route the traffic you have to know what you have to to root yeah and in this event one dynamo will go down the specified traffic will be simply be dropped uh rather than route routed via the other one links so you have really to decide is this the right solution so the expert mode in the outbound policies feel free and use the question mark they are not only help functions there are many different settings they are like the expert moves the expat mode is available for advanced users so click on the test balloon as i said and click on turn on expert mode under the expert mode a new special rule speed fusion routes is displayed on the custom rules tab this means you can say this rules are my ospf pgp and pep vpn rules roots pebbling does automatically and if you enable the expat modes you can set some rules that are more important than this speed fusion rules but be careful there by default this bars on the top of all custom routes this means traffic for remote vpn subnets will be routed to its corresponding vpn peer you can create custom priority or enforced rules and move them above the bar to override the speed fusion routes but don't forget if you disable the expert mode all rules above the speed fusion bar will be deleted so it's a nice setting the drop in mode what is that drop in mode do we need it sometimes so the drop in mode allows pep link balance or also max devices to be deployed in a network without incurring any configuration changes to existing network devices it simplifies the installation of a balance to an existing network by transparently and seamlessly working with the routers and firewalls it means you are arriving to your company with your pup link and they have a firewall they have some routers and they say yeah okay i need a second internet service provider but you are not allowed to change ip addresses of my firewall and my isp router for example then you have a big problem normally but if with padling's drop-in mode you can do it with only a short interruption the short interruption is to plug out the cable and plug it into the pad link router so only a few seconds in phase one you have to insert the pop blank into the existing environment suppose you have a migration plan similar to the following environment currently you have a default router with a default gateway 210.10.10.1 connected to isp1 on the firewall 220 10 10 10 is protecting your users to the trusted line we will be installing the pap link transparently between router and firewall then we will add the second isp connections to the network so we have the router with the dot one on the end we have the firewall with the 10 and the default gateway of the firewall is the one that's normally a problem for us if you want to go with the firewall out to isp2 because the gateway is a dot one our pap link we gave them with the ip address dot five on the end for one one and we set the lan bridge the one one subnet is 255 255 255 to 40. first we go to network interface slan and then we can set our ip addresses and we have enabled the drop-in mode we also set here the default one gateway that means the purple link has to know what is the default gateway for the other devices um notice the app table has to be resetted from some devices because the app up in the app cache of of the firewall maybe it is known that the dot one is the isp router but in the future that one is the public router because the purpling only simulates for the firewall that it is a dot one but it isn't the dot one it's the dot one only for the side to the fireball so on this side it looks like it is the dot one on the right side it is not the dot one though maybe you have to reboot the device or have to clear the up cache and after you have done it you can set the additional one connection so we say one two we have to enable um nut for that and that's it then our device is installed and we have done that but before it was a direct connection from isp1 to the sd switch or the firewall and in the future we can have multiple lines um there's a question but what i have three isp lines abc my persistent byte will be prior isp a with ratio of 10 99 is the way that i could let the isp to take the persistence load why do you want to do it with with this rule maybe you choose a priority outbound rule maybe it's better for you and you say okay then we do it with the priority rules i think you have to change uh choose another outbound rule that could be better so let's go forward with the drop in mode after we have inbound load balancing rules or do we have to create maybe inbound load balancing rules in our drop in mode once the drop in mode with multiple landing links is successful successfully set up we can proceed with inbound load balancing this will allow the internal servers to be publicly accessible so this task assumes that you are already have a good understanding of drop-in mode if not please read the guide of the drop-in mode in the patlink forum before you proceed further in our scenario we will use an example throughout this node suppose you currently have a network similar to the following pap link balance installed and connected to three isps using drop-in mode static ip address ranges subnets from the ips isps a firewall is protecting your trusty plan hosts and servers on the trusted lines are using private ip addresses we have enabled nut on one two and three to masquerade the ip address of ispa to achieve inbound load balancing so in our example we have root a with the 210 network with default gateway.1 on the end the isp2 is a 22.2.2 um alt always with the dot one as gateway and isp3 is 33.3.3 so how we how to set up the inbound load balancing in the drop-in mode we can do it in the additional public ip settings so network interfaces want to command settings and then we can select the val port and we can give them the additional ip addresses this rp addresses could be the ip addresses of our servers or the iphones we have from from from the provider and then the padling device will listen to this ip addresses as well it's necessary that you have this ip address here and then we can define the inbound servers then we can set in this example our mail servers after that we can go to services and can select the van connections where this service should be available so we have the smtp mail one in this example with one two over one two advanced three all those ip addresses and our mail server this means from 1 2 advance 3 we have set it up all this traffic will be routed to our web server our web server now has one ip one one ip2 and one advanced three ip it has like an external ip and is available from the outside so we can set up here a built-in dns drop-in mode it means you can delegate domains name servers soa records eg for here my company or myblink.com to the public balance one ip addresses um you can also act as a generic dns server for hosting an a a c name an mx record txt or ls records the padling balance can perform in this two methods either in the drop-in mode or in not in the drop-in mode it's not need to do this in the drop-in mode yeah and ptr records are created along with a record to point to custom ips if you create a a record in mydomain.com pointing to an 11 22 33.44 then a pta record will be pointed 443c blah blah blah dot in ip address arpa pointing to my mydomain.com will be also created when there's a multiple host names pointing to the same ip address only the ptl record for the ip address will be created inbound load balancing is configured via the dns records configured within public balance or the external dns records with an outstallative dns server so in this illustration you can see it will it will be available if you um if you're doing a request for an endless lookup for mypatlink.com you will get receive this three ip addresses with the dot five on the end for mypaplink.com for example and that's a really cool solutions to do it by yourself there's a question does fabling support sd1 of course pap link is a perfect sd1 system um you see this dns settings you can do into network inbound access dns settings then you can set all this settings also with priorities for different ones and you can select the one interfaces and the ip addresses you will you will set for this dns server um the soa and ns records it's also in the dns settings you can map one one one two interface to the name servers no so it's easy you can set the time to live and something else and you can set it easily here in this example we see how to configure the priorities it's like everything in paperling and drop down menu and select the priority you need of course here the mobile internet um we're only using the lowest priority but if you do it as an inbound dns connection with a mobile internet don't forget you need to have a sim card where nut is disabled uh or whether where it's allowed and possible to go from an external line to that the record for the name servers it's nearly the same type the host name including the vvv or if needed now if you own it right my.myfabling.com dvv will automatically associate it and only the highlighted ip addresses in the list receive responses to the ns query you select here multiple items in a list can be selected by holding the control button and clicking the items in case avan link is down the corresponding set of ip addresses will not be returned however the ip addresses and the custom ip field will be always returned don't forget to click on the save and apply these settings so it's really nice if you have your servers internally and they have to be accessible over multiple lines you have to be more secure or you have an internet web shop and you're losing a lot of money if one line is down then you have to do it it's a really cool feature and easy to set up with a pap link so one second i have i have to drink a little bit of coffee the dangerous registration or the domain delegation it's useful for users who want to delegate a subdomain to resolve and manage with public balance in order for the internet users to look up the host name it is mypadblink.com using the public balance you have to point ns records of it to the domain eg mypaperlink.com or here football.com and you can find this um i see bind a an eight or nine and this these lines um the zones will be filled a file of mypapping.com will be shown as you can see the outros auto racif dns for fubu.com those are the typical records for this and you see also it's the bar ip of the balance shown and for the v we also can see it so what happens if we do an ns lookup we can see this is the balanced ip address and with an nslookup for mycompany.com we can receive the correct lines and that's really cool we see the default server at the balance which give me the under the answer and my um my ip address or my my internet address will be um the the nslookup will give me the right answer here so the next very important thing in my eyes is to set the system in a r mode so high availability we are using vrrp for that so the virtual routing protocol so that means we have a one dot plus one backup it enables the fade over to occur if the master device shuts down uh this requires a pair of battling coupling devices operating an active standby mode that means it's not an active active cluster it's an active passive cluster when the master device is down the slave device takes over and handles all of the land traffic if you have some rules here like some some vpn tunnels here it takes normally less than 10 seconds and the first tunnels are holding on the slave device if the master device goes down you can put out the power cable the slave will be powered on immediately and will be act perfectly it works very very good the pad links but it has to be the same device the same hardware same hardware revision please and it's also good if you have the same firmware on it the public balance theory supports failover between two balanced devices based on a virtual router dancing protocol periodic 4rp adverse advertisement packets are sent out from the master device to for ap specific ip multicast addresses the slive slave device assumed the master devices responsibilities when these messages have not been heard from a predefined time interval so it means it's like a heartbeat huh a heartbeat or multicast the devices are connected together and if master doesn't hear anything if the slave does not hear anything from the master then it will be powered on so let's have a look in this example we have uh created a vrrp group it's important because if you have multiple public routers then you can create multiple virtual routing groups you have to set up a virtual ip address the virtual api just is the same for peplink master and peppling slave and the learn ip addresses from the devices are different from the virtual ip addresses if you enter the virtual ip address in the browser you enter the you will come on the web interface from the master and everything is fine if the master goes down you enter this virtual ip address you will enter the web interface of the slave device of course you can enter the slave device directly by entering the slave ip addresses if you want to send up set up a hard high availability um environment it's important to do to don't forget something in this example the sd switches has to be written down the firewall here in this example is a single point of failure but maybe the customer will change it to a firewall cluster as well but it's completely high available high available in this moment the drop on in mode is not needed to do that but you can do it it's only an example here so again if you set up the mode the master will go down for example the slave will do its completely job and if the master comes back then the traffic will be switched back to the master how to configure this it's really really easy we go to network um risk settings high variability then we can enter the group number and this example is 20. i don't know why 20 but we can use it at 20. we say what is the master and what is the slave on the left is the master right is a slave if we have a slave we enter the master serial number that we can see it's definitely this hardware we will use and we will copy the complete configuration so then we enter the virtual ip address and that's it if we click on save the host the device will be configured and the configuration from the master will be copied to the slave then you can see on the slave device there are some icons missing here in the top and configuration string is active why easy i don't want to change something only on slave so the web admin is really locked if i have to change something because i don't know or the master device is burned in a fire or in water or something else then you have to disable it you can disable the sync and then you can configure the master but normally it is synced and you should see sees this icon if you can see this configuration is active you know your high availability cluster is up and running normally as i said the configuration will be copied automatically but you can do it manually go to system configuration of the master unit click download uh the active configuration or over in control go to the system configuration on the slave choose the configuration you exported in step one upload the configuration from the up here and click on upload before applying the changes don't forget forget to change the iplan address and set it as a different one from the master as the master unit has so don't forget to go to network line of the slave unit and change the ip address after that save and to change the changes and then go to network high availability change the prefet role from master to slave and then save and apply don't apply it before you have done the other steps if you do it manually the hara mode so next step is internet bypass internet traffic bypass not many persons know this but it's a nice feature um make the long story short what can we do with that we have in this example on line three and one one there you see it small there's written line bypass from the hardware if i connect a device on lan 3 and the internet provider on one one everything will be rooted on my pap link okay what happens if my pep link dies then it's like a like a relay band 3 will be directed directly connected to one one and we can go in the internet this is really nice in some locations we can need it sometimes not but it's it's important to know that we have this cool feature for trains or something else it could be really important that we can use it with some devices uh crashing or sometimes it's better don't using the purpling than we are offline so this available features available i think in the public is 580 and higher it's a fault tolerant feature that protects you in the event of a power outage if the padling router doesn't have power you can't use it when it used in the drop-in mode such failure would be completely transparent to the network and the above in this example one one and one three and one are bridged together when the power runs out but if you use it our features will be disabled automatically so you can't use internet traffic bypass and hara mode of course if you say i want to use internet traffic bypass and the high mode why so let's have a look in the fireball rules the paddling router of routers of course it's not a firewall but we have firewall features and really cool firewall features at first we have we can enable the introducing detection and uh ddos prevention if we enable this we are safe before the most common features like the xmas some port scans cern that's that's really nice and we can set up the stateful firewall we have outbound rules inbound rules and internal rules you have to know that um pap vpn is also seen as an internal fireball rule and not an outbound rule so you have to know this feel free to create the rules as you want you can do it locally on the gui or you can do it over in control you can also set the all configurations locally on one router export the complete configuration import the configuration in control and use the firewall conflict from a local device in in control to bring this firework configuration out of every device you need it you can set complete domains in the destination you can filter ip addresses domains or all kind of traffic for the firewall you can also enable the packet inspection and use files from the packet inspection for the fireball routes also for the outbound policies by the way and you can also lock this um firewall rules then you can see it in the event logs um it's also nice to monitor what happens on your device if you use any any outbound policy outbound firewall rule any any allow but with active logging then you can see everything what's going through this router in the event block that's really nice to to troubleshoot something um on this page i miss a little bit um from the in control fireball rules um as i said we can use in control also to set the firewall rules if we use in control to do that then we can also set country-based fireballing yeah and this has to be on this on the slide in my eyes so you can set country-based fireball rules eg you say okay the the germans are not my friends tomorrow uh then i can block every traffic from germany or to germany for example uh then i cannot connect to you with my ip address from it by german ip address of course if i'm a public user and i build up a vpn tunnel like speed fusion cloud to australia then i can connect to you of course but in the normal way not we have some quality of service features this allows you to control traffic based on user groups um i think this is created from paperlink for the money team area you can see it on the names it may it means the group names are managers staff and guests so you can apply different bandwidth and traffic priorities prioritization policies on each user group and the bandwidth control and application sections in this scenario we have implemented an ip telephony system on the branch office and we have deployed an ip telephone server on uh reside the headquarter to optimize the voice quality over the infinite links qs is essential for ensuring that the voip traffic can be smoothly delivered across the sites so um we go to network who has user groups under the quality of servers either clicking on existing subnet or add button create a new subnet ip range and from the group down selected the desired group manager staff or guest and then click on save and that's it to enable uh on application go to network application qs click add button and then you can select the category in this example it's void also what ported voip protocols you can set the priority here to hi save it and then all wipe traffic is set to high you have multiple features as you can see here in the blocking section you can block it or you can prioritize it you can select skype or say bittorrent and something else also for the qrs but you also can block this it's also a qs application application blocking then you can deny some services like skype you have a lot of pre-installed features or tools or kind of applications you want to block thank you pabling for this cool feature i i love it really much so you can select the application like audio video streaming you can if you select the the headline in bold written everything um all supported streaming application everything but written under this will be blocked but you also can say okay i don't want to block out all of that maybe in the database i only want to block mysql then you can block that huh you have can select everything in detail what you want to do and it's a really cool feature and works really easy also you have the um web filtering blacklist um you can sell like the categories um like dating or drugs or maybe gaming sites and this will be blocked automatically and you can customize some other domains what should be blocked maybe you don't like the company is doing the same then you um then block them and you can't reach the website of them you can exclude the domains maybe sometimes a website is shown as a gaming website for example and you have blocked it but it's not a gaming website and you need it then you can exclude this domain and it will work again or you can exclude some users that you say okay the normal guests and staff are not allowed to use it but the managers are allowed to use that then you can set it or you can exclude some subnets so the bandwidth control from the qrs setting is also easy we as we have seen in in front you can select manager staff and guest these values are all the values we have set in the van settings if we have a smaller bandwidth on on the one line we can can enter that and in this example these are this standard settings with gigabit if we only have maybe 100 megabit we have to set it 200 megabit then the 60 would be 60 uh mac and the 20 are 20 mix and then we can put these slides to the left or to the right to make it more or less bandwidth on the different barn lines for the different user groups different user groups are directly connected to different vlans yes no the sas application traffic steering is normally all also in the local guy available um you have to enable the packet inspection um over in control yeah in in control you can enable the packet inspection but it could be possible that it's only available um on the on the in control side because it's a lot of um computer power in the background needed and we don't want to make the public router going slow that was a question written in the q a so next important thing is enabling ipsec and nut team normally you don't need it but if you have a customer who's using an old ipsec tunnel but this ipsec funnel is insecure and always crashes for example we have it a lot of times big customers then they want to set up a speed fusion tunnel but the admins are like dinosaurs they don't trust the new things so especially in germany um then they set up a speedfusion tunnel and over this produce through the speedfusion tunnel they will go with their ipsec traffic okay it's possible but maybe you have to enab enable the ip segna team so um if you have especially if you have the ipsec on the on the notebooks sometimes there then you need it um this what is what is it it's it's a it's a service pass-through support in the balanced router and by default the router has enabled ipsec rt if the ipsec is running on custom ports then you can define these ports accordingly so go to network service passthrough misc settings and enable the checkbox under ipsec nut t check the define box if running custom ports and fill in the ports you have pass through for other services each sip h323 ftp tftp can be enabled in this page as well smtp for the boarding is could also be enabled there are situations where the isps will block smtp forwarding from different isps thus the battlelink router allows you to control the right isp link to forward you smtp service this happens if you have multiple service providers because you want to to be always online then sometimes this can be happen when this option is enabled all outgoing smtp connections destinat for any host at tcp port 25 will be intercepted this connections will then be redirected to a specified smtp server at a port number sntp server settings for each one can be specified after selecting enabled so uh network settings service forwarding missed settings you will find the smtp forwarding when this option is enabled all outgoing outgoing dns lookups will be intercepted and redirected to the built-in dns named server if any live devices using dns name servers offer one connection like um 888 google or something else you may want to enable this option to enhance the dns availability without modifying the dns server settings of the clients the built in dns name server will be distribute dns lookups and corresponding dns servers of all available band connections in this case dns service will not be interrupted even if anyone connection is down yeah um these are the icons you can set as also the dns forwarding setup as i said it's a really really cool feature also the web proxy forwarding setup so feel free and always click on the question mark if you don't know what this feature means and this is really important to to have a look on every question mark before you do your test by the way that you can find everything the admin security page yeah nice to have nice to know you can set the app and password you can set the user password here you can set the security if http or https is only allowed is it allowed to access from the van or on the from the lan side what are the admin ports i will use that's important and you can also enable the authentication by radius if you enable it by radius then the users will be authenticated over your radio server in the log files of the pap link will be shown as admin the local admin and the local user accounts will be disabled then so when the device is not able to communicate with the external radio server local accounts will be enabled again for image emergency access yeah so it's not like closing the door and throwing the key away if your radius goes down the admin local admin will be re-enabled you can also set the admin passwords over in control that's really nice if you set random passwords for example or if you um can set different passwords on many routers in one step then you can use it over in control and also you can re see the passwords there that's nice if you have um maybe 30 or 100 public routers it's hard to change the up and passwords every three months so some of the settings are crucial to the operation eg in control remote assistance and email notification in control cloud management when this checkbox is checked the device starters of information data usage and configuration will be sent to publix in control setting system you can sign up there at incontrol.purplan.com you can register devices under your account monitor device status usage reports and as well you can download the backup configuration files here it's by default enabled and for the email notification this feature allows you to send emails um to some recipients when the following following events take place you can do the notification test you can uh say send in mail when a new firmware is available when the health starters change for anyone connection vpn startup changes bandwidth usage has reached 75 or 95 percent so you can enable this mail settings as well for the remote assistance if you have some issues or you don't know how to do something then you can um open a pap link ticket if you open a patent ticket i will show you later the details then please download the diagnostic report you see on this link enable remote assistant open a picket ticket at pap link and give them the information that you have remote assistant enabled and send on the diagnostic report if um remote assistance is uh enabled you will see it on the system information window that is on and you can't cannot select turn on it again so as pce as pathfix certified engineer you are a network specialist hopefully then you also can have a look on this hidden page normally the uh the if you are on the local guy you see the index cgi on the end of the link in the browser if you change index through support cgi you will enter a hidden page in this hidden page you can set a lot of stuff what is not possible on the main page it's like a layer 8 prevention or you can destroy a lot of things but you also can turn on the remote assistance remote assistance and you see the remote assistance starters here if it's off or if it's on so it's a second way to turn it on so now i talked about two hours um if you have questions i think stone has answered a lot of them i have seen a lot of them in the q and a board but now i can read a little bit of this and give you also some answers or stone can answer the other questions okay thank you very much for the news helping us to talk about the pce actually we got over 50 questions and then we answered a lot so what we will do next is today what we have answered the questions our cecilia is my teammate we will make a problem post at the paddling from.coming.com and listen all the questions and answers then if you still cannot find the answer you want then please uh let's uh let your questions there then we can follow up on the next webinar so then this will help us to continue this session number two in next wednesday so thank you in advance that uh we will see you again thank you please give a big thank you to dennis oh we can type it in the chat yeah thank you it's a pleasure and you haven't seen me you have no you have only seen the slide so so thanks for your help today and then so next week we will have the session number two we will go through another set of the materials and cc that will help to send out an email to tomorrow or day after tomorrow is about the slide and the recording today and then we will also arrange a forum post on what we have answered with the accident then in session two we will go for other content the end of the session two we will send out a mini mock exam for minimum exam then you will try to test for your understanding if you cannot find some answer or you do not understand that our other teammates don't will help on to explain the answer there so this will be the whole course of the pce but of course if you still have any things you don't immediately understand peaceful for you to ask and we will try our best to tell you uh what is going on thanks for your time today again see you next week thank you very much have a nice day have a nice day bye bye [Music]"}

"transcript": "thanks for joining i am travis sturrick with peplink and today we're here to talk to you about unbreakable voip how to keep your conversations always going always smooth and we've got two guests today to talk to us just exactly about that so i'll introduce our two speakers today we've got gordon beck from usa phone gordon go ahead and say hello to everyone hey thanks for having us travis thank you yeah and then we've got jonathan pitts from one simple phone jonathan go ahead and say hi hey everybody cool so you know lately we've been focusing on really trying to get folks who are using pep link in their daily lives in their daily jobs and their careers so that they can come and talk to us about you know why it is that they've chosen peplink and and what it is that peplink's able to help them do and problems that they're able to solve with peplink and so these two folks are in the voice over ip industry every single day putting phones out there supporting voice over ip phones and these two folks have both chosen pep link to to help them do that and so again we're going to dig deeper into that and kind of what it is about peplink that makes makes voiceover ip always work for them so if you're not familiar with peplink we get we get used in a lot of different areas and so our whole goal is to make it always work and whatever it is for you you or your customers that you need to work all the time and so peplink has some unique technologies that allow us to make it always work every single time so that whether it's voice over ip or streaming video or some sort of iot application or public safety right there's just so many different ways that people are using peplink but again everybody's primary goal is just to make it work every single time that they go to use that thing that they're that they need to do their jobs with so we're able to get into a lot of these different areas because we have a lot of different products right we have our 299 br1 mini we've got our epx the 2u kind of 30 000 ish type of specialty product and all kinds of devices in between we've got wire line we've got 4g we've got 5g so these different models and hardware form factors allow us to be relevant to different folks whether it's a kiosk or a voice over ip provider or somebody doing really mission critical public safety applications out in the field again it's this wide variety of different hardware and models that allows us to be relevant for those those different users and scenarios and help us solve their problems but it takes more than just a box to fix these problems right buying a new router buying a new gadget isn't going to fix your problems on its own and so it's this bottom layer here that we bring to the table that really brings the unique value to to be able to solve these problems so we've got our speed fusion vpn technology we'll talk a little bit about that in a second here we've also got our in control 2 management system that lets you lets you manage all of this stuff remotely from the cloud lets you troubleshoot and really scale your operations without having to do field service and troubleshooting live with with people out in the field you're able to take care of a lot of those needs just remotely with a few clicks and then we've got speedfusion cloud and speedfusionconnect see these are new services that we'll talk about to help make it easier to just get high quality connectivity wherever you're wherever you're trying to stay connected at so speed fusion is really the big difference there's lots of different lte routers out there there's lots of 5g routers but none of them have speed fusion except for peplink and it really is a big deal right other other vendors make these these 4g 5g routers they even have routers that have multiple radios in them but they're not able to solve problems the way that peplink is because they don't have speed fusion and so what does speedfusion do and how does it benefit a user there's a few different ways that you can use it in short speedfusion lets you take multiple connections and make them behave like one much stronger connection so that your applications don't know if it's using a wire line or an lte or a 5g and it doesn't know if we shift it from one to the other right we're able to use speedfusion to dynamically do that all in the background so that these applications don't know that there's any change in internet connection where other cellular routers aren't able to do that they'll set up your connection on either your wireline or your your lte or 5g and if there's a problem with that individual connection where your voice call or your video call got set up that connection will suffer your application will suffer until it breaks completely then it will fail over and then it will come back but you get interrupted you you suffer through that during the during the transition where with speed fusion we take all of that out of your applications visibility and make that happen seamlessly so you can use speed fusion to do a few different things you can take multiple connections and you just want to get more speed so we call it bandwidth bonding so you can do that for large file transfers or video surveillance where you've got just high data rate applications that need to go through but you know oftentimes people just want things to hand off clean right they want hot failover so if they've got a voice over ip phone or if they've got a credit card machine if their landline gets interrupted they just want that call to stay up they want that credit card swipe to go through and process and not fail so that's what hot failover does if there's an interruption right in the middle of your call right in the middle of that credit card swipe we hand it from the landline to the the 4g or 5g connection and again the user the applications they don't know that they just switched and they don't get interrupted they just stay up and keep going and finish that call or transaction and then when smoothing is a way to make your your audio quality your video quality better so if you've got multiple connections and you've got just you know you we've all seen it right either the the audio's got gets garbly or gets kind of skips and gaps or the video gets blocky and kind of herky-jerky that's because your connection's just not able to keep up consistently right it's not about peak speed it's about consistent speed right and so that's what when smoothing does is it uses both connections to send backup copies to make sure that every single second every single packet is going to get there in the fastest most reliable way possible and if one connection fails the other's already there to back it up and so those are the three basic ways that speedfusion is able to address problems with different applications or optimize at different applications so now we're going to dive more specifically into the voiceover ip world again so we've got a simple diagram here we've got the internet we've got a wire line and then we've got some sort of uh you know a backup connection so usually a 4g or a 5g connection and then there's just all sorts of devices here and so gordon i'll open it up to you first to just kind of talk about you know how you're using peplink out in the field and what kind of applications you're using it to protect yeah absolutely so um our big advantage bringing speedfusion in is you know when when a wire line goes down broadband goes down we're able to fail over seamlessly to the cell backup and what that provides is a consistent ip through the speedfusion cloud that way phones don't need to re-register they can still get phone calls immediately we're not dropping phone calls um and in certain instances we're backing up credit card machines and pos systems for customers to make sure that their critical money-making devices are actually online all the time who's like a typical customer of of yours of usa phone who how would you kind of anything from a pizza shop to small business law firms you know obviously pizza shops are very important that their phones stay online they need to be able to take those orders and their credit card machines stay online so they can process those orders so you know those types of applications are very very important that everything stays online and consistent and we're not seeing any kind of break in the connection yeah if it's six o'clock on a friday and the the phones go down at the pizza store that's a that's unexpected that's bad news okay jonathan how about how about you what kind of users and applications are are you deploying peplink out there with uh sure travis thanks so uh same as gordon we also protect uh you know poa pos and credit card machines um but also like business email so we have like you know several chains of uh medical medical companies as well as chiropractors and you know they just need to be able to reliably get those phone calls and be able to process credit card transactions for for payment uh you know we also uh do a lot of food trucks and stuff like that so that they have dual cellular so that they don't have to run off uh offline or use a square and things like that they'll be able to uh process the transaction and guarantee payment um and that's a huge thing because especially with you know chip and pen if they um you know do it offline and the credit card gets declined um after you know it comes back then they're out that money yeah i've kind of seen that actually at a local coffee shop here where the internet's down and they're square reader just keeps taking transactions but they're not verifying anything right kind of a took the brain away for a little bit and they're just going on hope that those cards are good for the money and yeah that's right and that's that's where like a tran the new transit pro would be a great addition you know being able to have multiple cellulars for on-site venues so that you know if the cellular network's too crowded because of uh too many people at least you have multiple options to get it out that's really interesting i mean the pop-up scenarios is awesome because i think for me the line is really blurred between like what's up you know people with pebbling people always ask like oh is that a mobile router is that a bus you know an office router and it's really hard to say it one or the other because like you said it could be could be a kiosk or a you know a small shop in a in a stadium where you know they're not mobile necessarily but yet like you said the the need for good connectivity is still there and maybe they move from this location to that location in the same building and so being able to kind of take that kit with them and have the same experience no matter where they are every time is obviously valuable to that that type of user but yeah just that that transition from wire line to i don't know if it's a fixed or mobile or you know depends on the day kind of scenario is right kind of cut kind of snuck up on us all i think because yeah every every sort of retail outfit wants to have some sort of mobile or pop-up presence it seems like no so i think there's kind of a division line here now between our two guests there's uh a couple different ways that you can utilize pep lincoln speed fusion to address uh whether it's voice over ip or other issues uh other connectivity challenges you've got so we're gonna give each each guest here some time to talk about the approach they've taken and how they're how they're using that that path to solve their problems and so we've got basically two two paths that you can take here to get speed fusion connectivity you can use our speed fusion cloud that's a hosted service that we're providing and we've got nodes all over the world to make it easy to get up and going and then we also let users deploy their own speed fusion nodes and so they can run their own kind of private speed fusion network and there's advantages and trade-offs to each of these and so uh gordon i think we'll we'll start out with you here's the the global speed fusion cloud map and you know again it's global so we've got nodes all around the world but uh your usa phone and you're in the usa like like myself and so you can see we've got a lot of nodes just across the country here in the u.s absolutely yeah so um as a voip provider we we do not manage some of our infrastructure so when you don't manage your infrastructure being able to do a speed fusion sd-wan into or near our our provider's data centers helps us make sure that connection is going to always stay up so generally our main nodes are in since we're in new jersey is in the new york area as well as dallas is kind of our failover so you know when we have a phone that's connected to the new york data center and we're putting it across the speed fusion cloud to pep links data center in new york and then we're just a couple hops away from there to our actual infrastructure being managed by another company yeah so you're just basically shipping a peplink router out to your customer and getting it you know using the the software tools to get it connected to speedfusion cloud yep absolutely yeah so we go ahead yeah so we basically deploy mostly balanced 20xs we have some br ones out there as well and um you know with prime care and speed fusion cloud being included in prime care we just deploy the pep link we usually put a cellular uh sim card in there the customers broadband and then we connect up to speed fusion cloud this way when a phone um is connected when we look at the registrations on on the back end they're all coming from speedfusion cloud's ip addresses so that means if we have a failover event the broadband goes down and we failed over to lte that that consistent ip address is what's helping us keep those funds registered as well as being able to still communicate and not drop that call awesome yeah and that's that's easy to understand if you've got hosted infrastructure out there and you just need a solution to make it work like you know having vpn servers and sd-wan gateways and all this stuff to manage yourself is it's just a lot and it's kind of yeah it takes extra staff that you don't necessarily you know want to hire so you know having uh pep ling take care of that for us is a huge advantage for us very cool so i think on the other side we've got one simple phone and we've got the more self-hosted path and so um jonathan i'll hand it over to you to kind of talk about how you've you've built your speedfusion network and why you've chosen this this path to deploy speed fusion thanks travis so uh speedfusion is um peplink's uh core product um and this existed long before uh speed fusion cloud but it also solves um some things that uh speed fusion cloud isn't able to uh solve or you know there's there's just different deployment strategies of why you would choose speed fusion versus speed fusion cloud we own all of our infrastructure all the way down uh to you know the voice nodes that it's installed in so we have you know either uh colo arrangements in dallas and columbus as well as you know just rented virtual machine infrastructure in google east and google west which allows us to cover the entire uh us and from that we're able to establish direct you know multiple vpn tunnels with our clients direct to our infrastructure all the way down to the individual ip address of the phone which allows us flexibility to log in direct to the phone itself and also do you know some interesting uh strategies with um you know a pri over uh sd-wan that we'll talk about later in the demonstration it's not to say that you know one deployment strategy is right or wrong it just depends on the needs of the client and we've chosen to do you know direct routed ips directly to the phone just for you know ease of troubleshooting direct from the voice node we can you know ping that direct ip uh we don't have to worry about any matte translations we're able to install our routers in front of behind or side by side in in the client's environment and it's just very flexible with that and vlan tagging we can separate out all of the voice infrastructure so that the client's pc router if they have one could completely go offline but the voice service would still stay up we utilize you know 20x vr1 pros we're also utilizing the speedfusion connect lte on demand service that we'll talk about later is there anything else you want me to cover travis i think um so it sounds you know you've built your own infrastructure because you're hosting other components as well do you find your customers are looking for additional services beyond just you know keep my phones working well are they using like the vpn connectivity between sites or is there are there other things that they're able to do with that we have done that travis we've done it for you know clients to be able to share you know a network drive at their corporate location they can route through route through our tunnels through our data centers and then out to the direct uh endpoints so that they can access their you know g drive or um you know corporate resources direct as if they were in the office so it's more of a i guess a full sd-wan experience i mean they're both approaches are are truly sd-wan but you're you're giving them more of a an end-to-end sd-wan where on the speedfusion cloud side you may be only protecting an application or two with that sd-wan um yeah that's correct um you would do this when you want to be able to access other resources we've also hosting all of our own infrastructure also gives us the flexibility to offer a public ip to clients you know we had a client there a non-profit autistic center and their fiber got cut and they needed to re-establish all of their ipsec tunnels to their other locations so by having you know public ips available in our data centers we're able to map a public ip from our data center directly down to their device allowing them to reconnect all of their you know cisco meraki's and stuff like that and the pep link's able to you know offer that kind of like an sd-wan as a service um in that type of scenario i'm glad you mentioned ipsec because it's something that i keep seeing over and over again and i see it both with speed fusion cloud and with the the self-hosted speed fusion cl speed fusion path is that you know a lot of companies with you know several locations have used ipsec to provide that site-to-site connectivity and so they've got you know a wire line maybe they've got a failover solution in place as well but just the nature of ipsec it does not fail over seamlessly right it's it's a make and then break and then re-establish and come back up type of experience so what i've seen a lot of customers doing now is they're just preserving that that ipsec infrastructure and they're putting a pep link in front of it so that they can run speed fusion and just leave the vpn as it is but we're basically tricking ipsec into being all of a sudden a seamless handoff experience yeah it's it's pretty awesome it has no idea that there's multiple internets in front of it and everything just works as it always did so they can keep their all their routing and vpns and all that stuff intact but yet all of a sudden now they've got this you know bulletproof sd win in front of it and yeah it's just fun to see like again you know i originally i thought of speed fusion as an alternative to ipsec but more and more we're seeing it's actually a compliment to ipsec because it's just hard and expensive to re-engineer a lot of these these networks that are already out there and so it's just cool to see that kind of um maybe unexpected use case there agreed okay so i think we'll we'll switch away from that that the the vpn and speed fusion infrastructure and we'll talk more about the management and day-to-day use case and so in control 2 is some a tool that i use constantly myself but um you know from from you guys's perspectives um let's dig into that a little bit i know we're going to start out here and talk about a new feature that we just launched within control but you know overall there's a lot of different tools in in control that make remote management and you know just standing and operating these networks a lot more user friendly and a lot more able to you know stay remote instead of having to do field trucks you know truck rolls and field installations and you know sending technicians to a location so before i jump over to you folks i'm just going to introduce to everyone here we've got a new feature again and in control that's called in touch so in touch is a tool that we've got to really modernize remote management and so you know you've got all these pep link routers deployed at all these customer sites and again you don't want to go there because it's expensive and it's far away and it's going to take time right so you want to be able to troubleshoot as much as you can from your office from wherever you are and so people of companies over the years have taken a lot of different approaches to enable this they've called it out of band management or oobm as we're showing here and so that that concept has been around for a long time right especially enterprises that build large remote networks they've got their primary isp and then they've got some sort of a a secondary path into that network so oftentimes they'll get a different isp maybe they'll get a dsl instead of instead of a cable modem or if they've got a t1 from a provider they'll get again that that cable or dsl but some sort of secondary path so that if there's a problem with that primary network they've got a way to get their administrators in there and troubleshoot right is my router down is it just my internet connections down did a switch fail right there's all these devices that are out at these remote sites and people need to get in and troubleshoot those and so again in the past oftentimes they had to build a full separate network to plug into these management interfaces of these devices so that they can get in when there's a problem other solutions have just used like simple vpns or there's dedicated applications that do remote management type of type of functions and so you know there's servers and software packages and things like that that people have used and installed to provide this type of functionality but now within touch if you've got a peplink router out at any location now you can log into any device that's behind that pep link router so if you've got switches or firewalls or ip phones as we're talking about here today or ip cameras all these different devices that you've got remotely out behind these pep links you can now log right into those web uis get into those serial consoles whatever interface you need to talk to so that you can do that all in band you don't have to build a separate network you've already got your wireline and your your failover lte or 5g connection on the pep link and so why not use both for both the users and your administrators right give them both a seamless experience so that they can get in remotely and your users can take advantage of both connections to stay up for their applications as well so in the past out-of-band management really didn't benefit the users right it was a separate path that was only there for the admins and now within touch you can have that pat that second path available for everybody and then you don't have that infrastructure you don't have to build vpn servers or remote management systems and pay for all that extra infrastructure and licensing so i'm going to just switch over to a demo quick here i'll show you guys how this works because it's really easy to set up and then we'll jump back into the conversation okay you guys should be seeing an in control screen jonathan or gordon you want to just let me know if you okay absolutely cool okay so i've got a i've got a device here i'm going to back up this isn't the device i wanted okay so i've got a router at my house i'm not at home right now um but nonetheless if we take a look at the client list here let's just see what's all on the network so if i'm remotely trying to support this this location here i've got an hp printer that's giving me problems and so i need to get into that printer and just figure out what's wrong with it right is it out of toner is it jammed what's going on right all i know is users can't print so i can see the printer on the network here i can click this in touch button so i'm it automatically identifies the ip address and all that fun stuff about the device and there's lots of different ways that you can get into these devices now this device has a web interface so that's what i'm going to use but you can see we've got ssh telnet remote desktop vnc there's lots of different ways that you could connect to remote devices so whether it's a server or a phone or whatever the type of device is there's different different ways that you might want to reach that you can also control kind of who can see this device so if i've got different tiers of users in my in control system i can either make these remote connections available to them or take them away from those users so i've got control to give more tools to my read-only users that maybe i don't want them to make changes on things but yet i still want them in here helping me troubleshoot but nonetheless i made a couple of clicks i saved that and now i can click on this go button right here and pull up that uh that interface i don't know if the screen share is following this connection here it's it is cool so yeah i've pulled up this this printer now i'm log right into it and the the really important thing here is i've not opened any ports to the internet right i have not exposed any sort of openings in my network this is all secured through https even though this printer's website or web interface is not a secure website i'm securely connected to it through in control right we're we're wrapping that that encryption around all of these connections so even if you're using an unsecured protocol like telnet or http that's all secure over from the internet's view because again we've we've taken all of those uh those port forwarding and exposed ports and kind of wrapped that protocol in in our own encryption so that we don't have to do that in a unsecure way so that that's how intouch works um again i just set it up in a handful of clicks so really really easy to to do and again you don't need any vpns or any extra any extra software to make this work you just need a public router and uh an active care plan on it so i'll switch back to the presentation here now yeah i mean it we've already started using this um in our own daily troubleshooting being able to log into a phone remotely really quick you know run a packet capture on a phone log into a switch you know you know change support settings stuff like that it's been very helpful and very quick it's a great complement to the vpn services as well do we have to have a specific firmware version for that yeah so you need the newest firmware eight two zero it's a new feature that just launched with that firmware and then on the in control side that's been rolled out on the cloud side we are so the the first version uh that came out supported i believe just http https and maybe in one other protocol but um my environment that you saw here has a faster release schedule of in control and so you can see we've added remote desktop and vnc and so we're just adding more protocols to that so depending on which planet you're on on in control you may see some of those new capabilities sooner than others the 820 firmware still supports these new capabilities so it's kind of a hand-in-hand relationship with in control in the device firmware but yeah 820 is is what you need on the router then you just need an active speed fusion cloud license to send those those remote connections through you don't have to actually set up speed fusion cloud but we just meter that usage on in touch because some people want to pull up cameras or vmc servers or rdp servers that are gonna you know eat a fair amount of bandwidth you use them remotely but yeah that's uh we're trying to make it as simple and easy and lightweight as possible for folks is it available in mars and earth yeah it is available in mars and earth it's just the the newer protocols like remote desktop and and some of those ones won't show up in mars or earth yet um those will show up as as so i'm on venus which is basically the beta planet for in control and so i'm seeing those features now where those extra protocols will be added later on on the other planets now if you ever didn't have a speed fusion cloud um current plan would it show an error when trying to connect on in touch or do you have more information on that it does yeah i ran i hit that wall this morning when i was just checking my demo environment actually i exhausted my speedfusion cloud license at home and so i had to you know it'll give you an error and it'll tell you exactly that it'll say okay good you're out of speed fusion cloud data right so it makes it pretty straightforward to identify that's your problem so again you don't have to set up the speedfusion cloud tunnels for this to work we automatically just utilize that that license whatever data bucket you've got available and so you know it's important for people to know that aren't familiar with uh speedfusion cloud is every device comes with one of those licenses out of the box if you bought a peplink router you've got a license for this already right now and then if you continue to purchase any care plan that also comes with a license for this automatically so if you're in warranty or you just bought the basically if you're in warranty you have access to this right now unless you've already chewed through all that data so and if you have you can top that up separately and it's very very very reasonable to to purchase additional data for these these applications you can scale your remote operations to as many locations as you want and you can get as uh deep and detailed into the different different remote management protocols or if you just need to log into phones wherever they are that that's great too we got a couple questions on in touch i don't know if you want to address them now yeah that's probably a good spot to to do that okay so i see one question i think i kind of answered this one already uh can you explain in more detail how you are able to utilize speed fusion cloud do you set up speed fusion cloud with default settings and use help on policies uh okay so i think that's more focused on just the general usage of speed fusion cloud not so much on in touch but nonetheless i'll answer it since i dove into that um so with speedfusion cloud you can use the outbound policy manager just like you would with any other speedfusion connection or just any other pep link application that you're trying to route in a specific way so yes you can use the outbound policy manager to integrate with speed fusion cloud to control kind of what goes to speed fusion cloud but speed fusion cloud also has a couple different easy buttons you can push so you can just kind of like i did within touch you can just choose a client off the client list you can say i want that device to always go to this speed fusion cloud node so you can just map a single client device to a speedfusion cloud connection you can map an ssid to a speed fusion cloud connection so you can just have a single wi-fi ssid that always goes to a speed fusion cloud connection and you can also just there's some easy buttons for carving out important applications like microsoft teams google meet zoom you know some of those really popular kind of collaboration applications we've got just the ability to select those and steer those automatically so even if your device in question is doing 10 other things we're going to inspect all that traffic and find the those critical collaboration applications and peel those over to speedfusion cloud so you can use those easy buttons or you can use the traditional outbound policies or you can kind of use both at the same time so yeah you've got lots of control over how your speed fusion cloud connection is actually used yeah and then travis we we use the outbound rules it makes it very simple because then we just point all the destination ip addresses to our nodes in you know new york or dallas and just route all the traffic across the appropriate speed fusion cloud funnel okay so yeah you don't have to get into all the port protocol stuff it's just you know where your where your services all live and so that's an easy role to set up yep yeah that's i mean that's similar to how i've used it for my voiceover phones too just i know where the server is so anything going there please please protect it through the tunnel another question here does intouch require speed fusion cloud or can it be used with traditional speed fusion too so it does require speed fusion cloud um it's just it's not set up to utilize an existing uh speed fusion infrastructure self-hosted speed fusion infrastructure but again you don't have to set up any of the speed fusion cloud settings actually it's just purely using that data bucket to to meter that usage so that you know because this all basically runs through our infrastructure on in control and so if somebody's sitting there watching their dvr all day we're getting peplink would be getting build for that that data transfer and so that's that's where the licensing component comes in on the speedfusion cloud is we're just able to utilize that data bucket that you've already got and and subtract your usage from there and so that way it's all tidy and anybody's usage is accounted for and again you don't have to set a bunch of extra stuff up to make it work but yeah it does not utilize an existing speed fusion connection okay well i think we'll keep going here so another tool we've got i think we'll just talk about a variety of different tools in in control but i think these are some ones that gordon and jonathan have selected that are really relevant to them and supporting voice over ip customers out there so the first one here is just the wan quality reports um gordon i don't know if you want to talk about this a little bit yeah absolutely so you know it's a typical scenario you got a customer call in saying they're having some call quality issues or some drop calls you know usually our first stop is to take a look at the win quality reports see if there's any outstanding latency or packet loss or you know maybe just up and down like you know the comcast modem is constantly going up and down you'll get those flags with the land up land down um it really helps us troubleshoot faster to make sure that you know we're providing that information back to the customer say hey you need to contact your isb or maybe just um you know reboot your comcast modem you'll fail over to the lte so your phones are going to stay online but at least you'll you'll get a fresh modem reboot and you know it's been a very very very big godsend to us being able to have a historical data on any kind of link that we have going on yeah and i love this screenshot you you grabbed here too because you know this is a wireline comcast connection right and i'm not picking on comcast at all every every network has their issues depending on the day but you know this is a wire line connection and i hear it all the time like no i've got a good internet connection i've got i've got a gigabit internet connection it's not my connection right and you look at the graph and yeah your connection's got problems here right yeah exactly most of the time you're you're really stable here but not all the time right if you look over right at the far left that latency that blue line is like they're go you know spiking up to 200 millisecond latency all of a sudden for you know an extended period of time there and that will cause problems with voip and you know it's plain as plain as plain as data c here on the graph but yeah without this data you don't really have an answer for that customer most of the time yeah and being able to send out this to a customer just to prove that you know what we're seeing is what's actually happening mm-hmm okay so you know the previous one was an else or this was a wire line connection and so you've got a little bit of data there and then here's an lte connection so you can see we've got a t-mobile connection and you get a lot more information here right it's a there's a lot more to keep track of on the cellular connection um it yeah so you're tracking there you still get your latency number so you can see how bad your latency is obviously that's important especially when it comes to you know sustaining a decent voip call you know how good your signal strength obviously you can see this one's kind of bouncing between excellent and very good so all that information helps you you know determine hey maybe i need to put an external antenna on this and get it closer to the outside of the building or even put it on the outside of the building um you know obviously that signal strength when you're running calls over you know over your cellular is going to be very important yep yep and that's i i like your comment about you know moving the antenna you know we just can't make signal happen right we have to do so if signal's your problem then you you've got antennas or placement or you know you've got something physical you're gonna have to do because the tower's not gonna move and you know it could be years before another cell gets added in that area so you know if you can see clearly that you've got low signal strength in a location then again you're gonna have to intervene some way with an antenna or moving the device or something like that but you know sometimes i see on these graphs that you know signal strength is not my problem it's just the quality goes up and down over the course of the day and you know that's something an antenna is probably not going to be able to help a whole lot with right if if the network's getting saturated or you know some sort of interference your antenna won't fix that and that's that's where you have to start looking at you know is it a do i need to look at a different provider or you know what you have to start kind of getting more creative when you run into those situations um absolutely jonathan are there any tools that that you use on a day-to-day basis in here and in control just in general so we use the the packet loss captures on our vpn tunnels as illustrated here on the right um quite often and this is actually an example of us troubleshooting the um a weigh-in quality issue with a client live while they're on the phone so we set up the vpn tunnels in such a way that their wired connection is primary one and their cellular is priority too and also matching the same thing on the dashboard now what happens when um you set it up this way is we can actually move the cellular on the dashboard of the max series devices live while we're on the call and instantly improve the call quality both seeing it on the latency and packet loss graph but also audio audibly with the client proving to them that the packet loss is actually on their wired connection and that's just an immense tool to show them live while they're on the call that we're able to improve their connection that's pretty awesome because it like you said you're you're able to actually improve the auto quality of the support call that they're making to you i mean that that's i mean that's the real world example of what speed fusion's able to do that other things can't right you can't dynamically insert a new connection to a voice over ap call with with a great cradle point router like there's just no way to do that it's pretty awesome that you're able to just turn turn up the dials and actually get their call quality improved right then they're on the phone okay so you know i think the the short story here is in control is great for you know you know people think of it like oh i don't i don't need that system right i've got the firmware i want on there i've got the configs i'm not going to change the configs right i don't really need this remote management stuff but it's to me it's really just the tools that you've got there to deal with these what-if situations right when when things don't go right that's where that's where these tools really come into play and and start to show their value is just giving you those those capabilities without having to get out in the field and you know go go there yourself or sit there on the phone with somebody remotely kind of trying to fumble through the wiring closet that they don't understand and try and troubleshoot through somebody else so next thing we're going to talk about is just how to keep connectivity simple with pepling what what are your options when it comes to bringing different different connections too to your pepluk router to your customers right because to me the whole the whole point of peplink is no single internet connection is ever going to be good enough to support the business that that you or your customers are trying to do right again it will fail at some point right no internet connection is perfect and it will go down and it will degrade in certain circumstances and those are times when you're you still want to do your business the way you always do your business and so again that's what that's what pepperling's whole point is is to solve those problems but to solve those problems you sometimes need a second connection there and that's where things get kind of complicated for people sometimes they they just number one they don't want to pay for that connection number two they don't want to deal with two providers right it was hard enough to get one internet connection now you're telling me i have to go get another contract with another company and start you know do that whole process over again like no thank you um so that's where we just launched uh speedfusion connect and so this is a new service that we're offering to our customers to provide that that lte data and so it's just an easy button again to get access to verizon t-mobile at t any three carriers in the us so that again whoever is great in your area you're going to be able to get access to them and you don't have to set up contracts with all three carriers to do that you've got an easy path to that connectivity um and you can you can switch if i'm not mistaken travis between all three like instantaneously yeah correct so it'll be a it won't be a seamless handoff on the on the individual sim um but you can switch that sim from one carrier to another and it'll it'll just disconnect and reconnect and obviously if you have speed fusion running it's gonna smooth that process out but you know switching the carrier on any single sim is definitely available and then it's quick right it takes 30 seconds to switch your switcher carrier at any spot so yeah if you're just finding you know the carrier you usually use doesn't have great signal for this customer you know let's just switch it over and try one or the other carriers and it's not a different rate it doesn't cost you any different it's just you know pick whichever one is is going to work at that location that's reversal jonathan this is something that you've been using in your deployments do you want to yeah thanks uh thanks travis um we have been using it exclusively um you know we used to use primary verizon wireless and we still do on occasion um because our verizon wireless plan has public ips but um for supporting our traditional voip customers and also you know some uh new interesting strategies that we've done we've you know rolled out several hundred uh coveted internet hot spots across the u.s and being able to use speed fusion connect um specifically with the uh not only our voip customers but also the covet hotspots has offered us immense uh capabilities that we weren't able to do before uh such as being able to select you know the carrier that's uh best at that location now you can't automatically switch when you know that's your only provider but if you already have a wired connection or if you're using something like a transit duo then you can actually um you know switch to that other provider on that particular cell modem live and you know instantly see uh performance improvement and then if you're coupling that with either you know speed fusion or speed fusion connect you can still make it where you could switch providers for one of those uh cellulars without losing the connection and still keep that data up while switching providers if you only have a single cellular modem and that's your only uh connection it would go down you know temporarily while it reacquires to another uh cellular provider but i also wanted to talk uh just real quick uh travis on the previous line so this is some things that we use in conjunction with speed fusion connect specifically we had peplink add plmn switchover to pushover and if y'all aren't familiar with the notifications in um peplink they've come a long way and you'll want to review the notification sections on the the group level because it supports the pushover app which is a it's a third-party app that you can load on your android and iphones and there's tons of different events that you can get for your clients devices or your own devices on you know if a carrier switched over if the device is online offline and then in control is you know so much more than just you know remote web access which i think is a primary use case for a lot of people you know it supports group policies multiple firewall and outbound policies we use the notifications again on the pushover app as well as the api integration to you know customize and show um usage alerts to our client yeah i'm glad you mentioned that i think you know i've seen a couple comments or questions already kind of coming through of people people hungry for more like technical details like how do you protect the voip what are the things you're doing and you know where are these features and so i think we're getting close to the end of the hour here but um i just want to point out now that after we're done with with the presentation here i will stay online and i'll actually go live into in control and show show some folks a few more of these details where some of these knobs and dials are and where some of these reports and things like that are so that people can see these these more directly for those that are ready to dig in but i'll keep moving on the slides here um this is the so like i said we've got the the speedfusion connect lte service available to folks right now it's supported on a handful of models here you can see down on the left and we are growing that list that will that will continue to expand um if you if you're the type of user where you've only got a handful of locations or um you know you just don't need a whole lot of devices or a whole lot of these these types of connections that that model list is basically where you're going to be able to do that with and then this is the pricing that you you have available to you if you've got like 50 or 100 devices where you need to kind of roll this out at scale that's something where you're going to want to reach out to your your channel partner your your reseller at peplink and we can have a more direct discussion about how to how to structure this better for uh you know larger scale operations so that it makes sense in those scenarios as well so again if you're if you're on that you know handful of devices these are plans that are available to you to again use all three carriers right now but if you've got a larger scale operation definitely reach out and we can talk more more specifically about what makes sense for your scenario i think there's some other interesting stuff here too though i mean we're making data available as you know just purely to make it as convenient and easy as possible for people who need to do this at scale but you know we're not trying to get in the way of people who already have their own connections who already want to bring their own sim cards or service plans right we we work very closely with a lot of different carriers to support their customers as well and so that path is always available with pep link we're not limiting this to you know our sims only or anything like that this is just purely a compliment so that you're able to get additional connectivity if it's if it's hard for you to do that some other way so talk about this real quick travis yeah i think this is a fun one that jonathan put together here um because it's a great example of maybe a more unique way of using a another connection that didn't come with the pep link or didn't get sold by the pep link so this was a um you know a company where they had already purchased a ring pro which is the device connected to the att network there on the left and you know we're implementing our voice over ip service um using the balance 20x here and what we did is we set it up so that not only do we have access to the cellular from a management perspective in the 20x but we're allowing the customer to reuse their existing cellular service that they're getting through the ring pro so if people aren't familiar with the ring pro it's a security appliance so that you can attach your ring cameras doorbells other z-wave devices and use it as a security system but we're also able to use it as a failover wired connection either using the usb wan or the soon to be public uh virtual wan license of the 20x so it's just another example of how you know even if you had a cellular backup device you know the the 20x or a peplink in general can complement that by you know using speed fusion cloud over the top of an existing or another available cellular unit yeah that's really interesting because i mean you know it's obvious that you could take a an att sim card and plug it into a pep link right i mean that that's pretty straightforward but when you've got a device like that ring pro and those are very popular right those ring systems are you know you walk through your neighborhood just about everybody's got one on their doorbell but um you know being able to harness that built-in connectivity from a different device and repurpose that for protecting your phones is awesome really thinking outside the box jonathan here's another i think unique scenario that that's pretty cool to me i mean a lot of what peplink does is we're bridging the past to the present right there's all these uh legacy devices that people still use and people still need and so uh jonathan you've got a deployment here that really speaks to that same story yeah so walk through this we did um a deployment of a an existing pri circuit um for a client over sd-wan so the scenario was um we're fine with our nec system it's going to cost an immense amount of money to redo all the cable plants to where all the physical phones are located but we're just not in love with our current provider that's providing that pri circuit you know what what solutions do you have for us so in this scenario we're um actually using a peplink20x to some of our multiple data centers where we can provide a sip trunk to pri service over a yay star gateway direct connection into the nec pbx so there was no modifications that were needed to the client's existing pri pbx and we're able to provide a drop-in pri over our existing infrastructure and leverage peplink to provide an sd-wan connection which you know a typical pri is a direct point-to-point connection and now we're able to extend that over you know multiple internet providers and provide the customer with the same quality actually better quality than they used to have with their existing pri provider because it was always going down due to degraded copper so you've basically replaced miles and miles of single point of failure and replaced that with a modern multi-win sd-wan and [Music] the phone system doesn't know the difference right it's that's right that's cool um i think these are some other tools you've used some of our apis as well to do some unique things here i think this is awesome so we use the cloud soft phone which is a um you know a software that can connect to you know multiple different kind of sip back ends but we're utilizing the web services tab here with some really sweet integrations with the pep link where we can show you know usage alerts usage consumption if the the pep link is online so some of the things that we're doing here is you know is the pep link connected is it connected with cellular how much usage has it um used and then you know further on we'll also leverage you know the ability to check you know active sessions in the pep link how many phones do i have on online so that you know manager and owner can not only answer phone calls on their soft phone app but they can also you know quickly at a glance you know see the state of their pep links and uh physical devices online at several of their locations very cool yeah i love the api access is something that i'm always really intrigued by i mean people have built so many neat custom dashboards that you know just get the get the useful information for their customers in in front of their face so they can just boil it down to exactly what that customer cares about and needs to see and you know not give them that complicated you know to them complicated management system right so i think that covers all of the content we've got we're just here at one minute left so i'm gonna open it up for q a jonathan and gordon if you guys have time to stick around for some questions stay as long as you want um i'll stay on as long as it makes sense here and keep going and yeah if you got a drop go ahead and drop but um yeah let's pull up the q a here just so everybody's aware this webinar is recorded and it will be uh posted on our forum so if you've registered for it you'll get an email with a link to that probably within the next day here so yeah just if you registered and you need to jump off and you don't want to miss something that'll be on the video shortly so we'll make that available for everybody i am just going to dig through the questions here and we'll start teeing those up okay so first question i see can the public router replace the customer sonic wall or watch guard router um so yes is the answer but the nice thing is it doesn't have to either so you know i've seen this and i think pizza stores are a good example of that of this where you know you're not going to replace that router right they will not replace that router and you cannot touch that router in most cases right that is their corporate firewall and appliance and you have to figure out a way to make voip work without touching any of that and so it's a great example of where peplink's different software features make it easy to integrate there i think jonathan you've definitely ran into this scenario several times where you kind of got to play nice with what's already there yeah yeah talk about that so um we're really good at you know working well with the you know other it department's network uh you know franchise requirements things like that so we can be in front of where we can [Music] be in front of the sonic wall and just pass through some ports we can be beside it you know if you have additional wan ips we can be behind it where we just leverage speed fusion connection actually through your existing router and then there's a fourth scenario where it's a drop-in mode so if you have you know the public ip on the sonic wall maybe you don't exactly have you know the current login in front of it but you want everything to kind of seamlessly work uh drop-in mode is a huge win to be able to get yourself in front of and still be able to protect applications awesome yeah you know for the for the folks that do want to replace that that sonic wall or watch guard there's there's lots of security features on the public so you know there's there's the traditional stateful firewall which is awesome because you can manage that within control in bulk so you can you can manage a thousand firewalls at once and add a rule or subtract a rule to all your all your locations quickly and easily but we've also got layer 7 deep packet inspection application blocking so there's there's a lot of security tools available to folks that do want to replace that that existing router and have something still be very secure and again speed fusion connect and speed fusion are are other ways to enhance your security again you're not having to open up those ports directly to the internet like you might have done on a previous appliance and so sometimes it's more of a you know philosophical or an architecture change versus just you know having the same security features you might use these tools differently to avoid needing some of these different different security tools as well but um we've got a an article on our website called defense and depth so if you just use the search function on our website just i think if you just search the word defense you'll find a good white paper that it really just outlines all the different layers of security features and functionality we've gotten the peplink routers so that you can kind of understand what's all what's all there and with what's possible yeah the other thing too with drop-in mode that i don't think a lot of people know is that with the latest release of drop-in mode you can run drop-in mode in front of another firewall and still use another vlan for your phones so you can have a completely separate network for the phones running through the and then everything else go through drop-in mode on the existing firewall and that's i mean there's so much creativity available you know because you can like you said you can you can plug that that new vlan into their existing switch even if they're able to kind of carve out a vlan that matches on that side but again you're not interrupting any of their wan infrastructure so there's just a lot or you can just plug it into your own switch for that matter but yeah it's just there's just tons of tools there to make the integration part easy depending on what the what the customer's requirements are okay i see a question about speech connect data plans you can purchase those through your resellers those are those are definitely available there's partner discounts and things like that so you've got uh you know i don't know exactly what the discounts are but you know there's silver gold platinum type of pricing discounts on those plans so definitely very reseller friendly in that in that sense i see one question on the chat is this available available for privately hosted in control and i think so number one that's a good thing to talk about our in control management system is hosted in aws it's a public system so you know lots of different users have their own little private accounts on there but some people will not allow public cloud management systems to be used for their data right they've got really sensitive security postures sometimes it's government sometimes it's just a large enterprise but another really unique aspect of pep link is you can take that entire cloud management experience and deploy that in your own private network so you can run the full featured in control experience in aws aws gov cloud google cloud vmware esxi or hyper-v so you can run in control completely in your own infrastructure in a private network and so you can comply with whatever security requirements a customer has and in touch that feature that we just showed you that is also available in that privately hosted configuration so you're able to get every single feature you would out of the public in control in a private environment so that is available and again you've got all of those features available if you do the privately deployed in control yeah it just requires a little extra setup wildcard certs and things like that but we've been able to set that up yep yep it's definitely more involved i mean it's not the easy path right setting up and control yourself is it takes more work but you know there's there's very valid reasons that people want to be able to do that and again you know you can't do that with cradle point you can't do that with meraki you have to use their public hosted cloud if you're using those those vendors there's just no other option for them other than to subscribe to those systems if you if you want to keep using them so there's no private no private path for those those types of products i see a question here i'd like to get an answer from travis on a speedfusion connect can be available for the balance 20x anytime soon yeah that's a good one um so right now speedfusionconnect is not native for the 20x again we've got some other options for people who have a lot of devices out there um but we will be making that a native experience in the next hardware revision as well so um for those of you that have them already that that won't probably help you in that in that case because there's a hard work an additional hardware component in there to make it a fully native experience there but again those that have kind of higher volume needs that that's something that we'd be able to talk about and find a solution for there as well so i see a couple people who've just made comments about you know this device or that device they're having some issues with in touch um in in in control there is a little blue banner on the right hand side usually that says feedback and that's kind of the it's kind of the button that everybody ignores because they assume it goes into some you know garbage bin that nobody ever looks into but um i i'm proud to say that if you push that button in control and you leave some feedback or some question and you've got a problem with something it goes to people it goes straight to people who can help and are willing to help and dig into that problem so if you're having troubles with in touch on a specific device that feedback button is probably the quickest way to drill into that if you're in that screen where you're trying to pull that up push that button you can it lets you like kind of screenshot different aspects of the of the ui so you can point to and believe knows exactly where you're you're kind of having a problem and then you'll be able to get a high quality response then from the the team to try and dig in and investigate that issue you know gordon i know we ran into this with you too right we had an issue with a certain yea link phone and it just took a a couple days to for the team to investigate and figure out what was causing the problem we were able to make it work then after that so there will be device level issues that we run into over time with in touch but yeah that feedback button is a great way to kind of accelerate that process or you just open a support ticket with us as well as is the other way to address some of those those kind of individual issues you may have you see one question is it possible to get speed fusion without the cloud so that i think is basically what we were talking about so we've got speed fusion cloud and then we've got speed fusion where you can run it you know you can use physical public routers and put those in data centers you can use the fusion hub virtual machine you can put that in you know your own physical hypervisors you can run that so if you've got a customer that has their own vmware or hyper-v infrastructure you can run fusion hub there and use that as your uh your own self-hosted speed fusion again or you can put physical public routers like a 580 or you know an sdx pro or something like that as kind of a speed fusion head end jonathan i think you're using those those sdx pros as your speed fusion gateways is that correct yes um yes travis we use the you know speed fusion speed fusion pro 710s and then fusion hubs and then we do some complicated you know static routes between them so that everything in can access it but essentially we use you know those devices up to their license limit um as we're adding in clients but we're able to you know seamlessly integrate all of that you know on a on a per data center basis obviously you can't run the the sdxs and 710s you know in locations such as google east and google west and uh for those that aren't aware you know fusion hubs are great but they lack some of the uh routing capabilities that the the standard peplink products uh use so it just kind of depends on you know the deployment scenario where a client will be added to depending on you know do they have additional requirements such as routing you know corporate network um data such as you know um file sharing and and things like that or are they just needing to access you know um one thing such as you know our voice over ip servers nice yeah it's you know it's it's a different path in terms of the licensing and you know the the the model you you purchase to deploy it and you know there's different capabilities there too but the short answer is yes there's there's ways to do it yourself too i think that the cloud environment is is another good one too because you know the the fusion hub doesn't have exactly one-to-one all of the routing capabilities of the the physical pep link routers it's got a lot of them right it's got bgp and some of these finer things but we've also done some things in the cloud space like with aws we've got they've got a feature called transit gateway connect where you can basically uh ride the aws global backbone to interconnect your different locations and sites instead of you know before with fusion how you kind of had to have tunnels coming in from your edge locations and then tunnels going back out the internet to your other fusion hubs or points of presence and so we've been able to integrate with some of the cloud native functionality to improve the networking capabilities if you're you or your customers are heavy users of those types of services as well so there's just you know there's just a lot of options is what it comes down to which is you know there's a lot to talk about and understand but it gives you that flexibility when you get into these different scenarios as well um there was a question by lee um travis that you might want to go um or no not lee there was uh there was somebody that wanted a more in depth of how we configured the vpn tunnels okay yeah that's i think i think we've kind of mentioned the chat or was that in the the questions i'm not sure but i think i think it's a good time to jump over to the i'll jump over to in control and start just kind of popping into some of these different uh features that we've talked about okay we're back it was by uh george travis i was really expecting to see best practices on setting up hot failover for voip okay yeah so i think just a combination of the priority levels on a vpn tunnel and then also um maybe an outbound rule as applicable but i'm sure you got a couple examples if not i can find one as well yeah so i'll ju i'll start there so we're back into this uh in control environment here hopefully you folks are seeing that yep okay so first things first is we've got the speed fusion configurator right here so if you've got your kind of own speed fusion infrastructure which i do in this case i've got i've got a couple different nodes here i've got this ubr and the max hd4 and then i've got this fusion hub i've got this fusion hub in a cloud data center just sitting there waiting for connections so if i go to this pep vpn speed fusion configuration you can see i've got this demo network set up here so i've got this profile enabled i've got my hub which is that fusion hub and then i've got this broadcast in this home location as as endpoints on there so you don't really have to set a whole lot up here to make this tunnel all work um you can just check all the boxes of the devices you want connected but then you can set some of your different wan connection settings so in my case this is like this is like my production bulletproof it's gotta work every single time type of type of demonstration right so i'm live with hundreds of people i don't i don't have time for any interruptions so i've got my link failure detection time turned up pretty fast so if if a link fails i'm going to know about it i've got about two seconds of lag time there but i've also got one smoothing turned on so it's going to use multiple connections at the same time to protect my applications in this case so you know that's just a trade-off that i've made right i've chosen to eat that extra bandwidth on my cellular connection to make sure that it's just flawless and smooth every time but you can set different uh you've got different link settings here now that you can get into more individual uh settings on each end so you can turn those settings on or off change there's just a lot of knobs and dials with fusion which is great because it helps you deal with different scenarios that you might run into but these are also knobs and dials you don't need to generally change to get up and running you know it usually just works great without making these changes but as as you know how to do as you know there's problems and you have to deal with more problems you can you can come in here and make these changes you can also set up multiple tunnels at once so you can have different tunnels for different applications so you can have a hot failover tunnel and a speed fusion tunnel for you know when smoothing or something like that so you can send your your team's call through the lan smoothing and you can send your credit card through the through the hot failover so you've got more efficient and targeted uh solutions for different applications [Music] that's a great point on the existing tunnels travis because you can have one connection up to that same speed fusion cloud or speed fusion and uh leverage different rules for either video or voip or credit credit card transactions so that you're not always eating uh extra data for your land smoothing yep and so you know in in my case i'm using one smoothing right now and so i've got all of my priorities set to one basically they're all in the same group together and so they're all available to be used at the same time but if i didn't want to eat up with my cellular data i can make those priority two right and i'll only use those when my primary one fails right and so i i can modify the strategies here to be more cost conscious and i can even you know in this case i've only got one wan connection in that priority one so i can actually leave when smoothing turned on here and if my primary connection's on it's really not going to use one smoothing because there's only one connection but if that primary fails then it's going to use land smoothing across my two cellulars so again there's a lot of granularity here but again it gives you just so much flexibility in how you deal with different scenarios you know if i'm on my wire line maybe i trust this one and i know it's consistent every day and i don't have to worry about you know backup packets on different connections but if that when if that wire line goes down i know i can't trust either cellular provider here to be consistent and stable enough for all day long voice calls right so then when i go switch over to cellular in this case i've got two of them so then i can do the one smoothing only on the cellular side so again just lots of different ways that you can configure your your combination of links to you know deal with your cost but also solve solve technical problems but again i'm just clicking all these things remotely right this is this is all pretty easy setup here that i'm stepping through again there's lots of options here but i don't have to pick most of them right i don't have to do almost anything to get this up and running at a base level and then i can always come back in and tweak and change and you know refine on that later but my goal is always get it up and running first and then we'll work on the fancier stuff after after we get it up and running and routing and working the way we want it to i'm going to just cancel that because i'm not going to make changes to my network right now but i'll also show you the other side of this if we look at this broadcast device this is that one that's on that land smoothing profile oh you know what this is why i always invite like to invite guests because i learn things that i don't that i didn't even know existed sometimes when i when i talk to our customers and that's that's the best part so these graphs are awesome because you've got these real-time statuses here jonathan i mean you're talking about using these tools live with your customers and then you've got the graph view here as well so you know we can look at my my mix of different connections right now that i'm talking to you through right i'm i'm running this call through this tunnel right now and so we can see you know where the latency on each each link is what you know kind of how much throughput we're sending through each link over here you can see the different connections that are in this so i've got lots of details on the cellular networks and the wire line network there but yeah this is this is my live tunnel that i'm i'm running land smoothing on right now and you can see it right there and i luckily i don't have any real packet drop issues to deal with right now so it's you know more just insurance than anything at the moment but unless that that information is all right there in front of me as we're live here you can also get into that in the router itself um but i want to switch over to the notifications part because i think there's just a ton of functionality there that a lot of people don't realize is there so if i'm in this group level here for those of you that aren't familiar with in control there's different levels that you're at so the scope of what you're doing is controlled by what level you're at so i'm at the group level now so everything that i'm using in terms of these tools up here apply basically is of the perspective of all of these devices in this group so if i come over here to settings and i go notifications i can create notification profiles that would apply to all of those devices in this group so again we've got tabs here so you can set up multiple profiles at once but basically i've created notification profile one i've enabled it and i've said it applies to all devices in this group but you can also use tags to zero in on a subset of devices so if you only want to alert for routers or if you only want to alert for customer a if you've got a bunch of customers in one group together you can use the tagging functionality and control to again get more granular within this group you also put quiet hours in there so if this isn't a you know wake me up type of emergency i can i can preserve my sanity in these hours um but there's just tons of different events that you can create alerts for travis can you swing down to the um pushover and url yeah because i think a lot of people don't um bother this scroll down as far because i think even when we first talked to you you didn't remember about the pushover the pushovers again a really great fantastic app that's a third party app very inexpensive and you can send notifications to that but i saw another question on the forum about or in the uh video presentation about uh you know a customer or somebody has tons of pep links but you know the notification periods and and things that are in in control just aren't um working out for them or they need some additional capabilities and this is where i'd highly encourage you to use the https notification url because you can ingest all of those notifications and then you can write whatever logic you want to um specify you know when these notifications are sent are they sent via email sms or you know just develop your own infrastructure around your needs and so the in control will basically be the proxy they'll get all of these notifications from all these devices and then ship it off to your url and then you can do you know either work in-house or work with a consultant to get you know that strategy um set up for your specific needs yeah and i think this is an important point because you know in control is great and it does a lot for a lot of people but it doesn't do everything for everybody right and it never will so we we try and make it as extensible as possible so that we can spill this data out to third-party systems and and different ways to massage the data more specifically to what you or your customers need and so yeah this is a great example of that and again a great example of why i like to bring the experts on like jonathan here because i didn't even really know much about this pushover integration or what the what the value there was and so again just another cool little easter egg that we've got tucked in here in all these other features but you know there's so many different things that people want to know to get notified about right if just if i set up like you know i've got cellular maybe i've got two different sim cards from two different providers that i've brought to the table and they've each got their own monthly data bucket right i set up those data buckets in the router uh there's there's different features in the gui to tell it you know sim a has this much data a month and this billing cycle starts on this date and sim b has this cycle start date and this amount of data and so you set all those up but then you know now you can get alerted for that right you don't have to set up all your email gateways and do all this kind of crazy stuff that you used to have to do in the router itself in control is gonna receive those events and then serve as that that email blast uh place so that you don't have to again set up yet more infrastructure to notify on these things but no swim car sim card switched over somebody took the sim card out right there's just lots of little things you know somebody logged into the web admin right there's just so many different little events you know wands go up or down right i don't know what's important for you to know about but there's lots of different things that you can know about if you want and again you don't have to notify everybody about everything you can control you know based on their their account level within in control who gets notified for these things or you can just create a custom list for who gets notified about these things and so you can have a silent period for one group of users but a wake me up type of profile for a different group of users for the same type of events even so these multiple tabs give you so many different ways that you can use this and kind of customize that and you know maybe avoid some of that notification overload as well okay what other items do we need to show folks in the i know there's a question about outbound policies and making sure all your voip traffic goes across the uh yeah so i think i'll go into the router first to show you the outbound policies i i'll do that with just first pointing out we've got all of these things can be managed here in bulk so we've got outbound policy firewall rules acls vlans there's so many different settings that you can do in bulk to all of your devices but i think just to understand the concept we'll log into this router here and just show you because i've done something fairly simple but specific at the same time so this is that that broadcast router that i was in this is that tunnel that we set up and pushed to the the device so that's my speed fusion connection here um but if i look at the outbound policy again i'm using this for a very specific use case this is my bulletproof box that anytime i'm live in front of people i want to just plug into this thing and not worry about whatever i was tinkering with on my my main router right i i don't know what i may have done to myself that's going to cause a problem as i test out this feature that feature you know try and configure these different things and so i've got a dedicated box to just make my connection work great every time so that when i get on these events i know it's going to work every time so for this device i've got one rule and it's tunnel everything to to my fusion hub so i i've set up this custom outbound policy my algorithm is priority in this case so if that fusion hub is available send it there first if that's not available send it to the hardwired win if that's not available then i've got cellular one cellular two and then wi-fi lan so that's kind of my pecking order of connections that i prefer to be on and then you know if i don't if none of those connections are available i'm done right i have no more connections so in this case i'm dropping i'm dropping the traffic but you know these work just like a firewall a traditional firewall does so you know they're going to start from the top and go down to the bottom and so if this rule were at the top you know i may want to choose well this is the bottom rule so i can't but that if it's a higher rule i can choose to just keep moving down the line and try the next rule and go that way so again it's granularity that you're able to achieve here and create different policies and different uh combinations of these rules to do different things last but not least terminate sessions on connection recovery that's basically fail back so i'm going to fail down this list but as a higher priority connection comes back available i want to fail back up to my higher priority connection and that's what that checkbox does for you and so for me that's really important right i do want to push my call back to that fusion hub if if that was interrupted for some reason i don't want to keep riding unprotected if i don't have to but some applications you don't want to do that necessarily because it may be disruptive to that application or something so there's again different ways to do that but i'm going to add a rule here because you know we talked about a few different ways there's lots of different ways that you can structure these rules to identify different traffic so i think gordon you you and i talked about just it's from yeah i just pointed to our the ipa addresses of our infrastructure actually you know because there's multiple ip addresses um we have a block of you know 100 addresses in our data center so we'll just do a whole block yeah you can do it based on a domain name too like you know i've got my webserver.com i know that's my voice voip server anything that's trying to get to that that url it's going to automatically send it with with this definition right so you can choose lots of different uh destinations and again it works just like a firewall rule right if if my source is any you know that condition's checked so it's just looking at outbound traffic for that that specific server and then again you choose whichever algorithm you you want one thing i'll say on the algorithms there's a i think a natural tendency to use the enforced tool and it it's with great power comes great responsibility kind of thing right if i set it in force to use this vpn right like i know i always want to use the vpn but you know the question is what happens when the vpn's not there right if there's for some reason the vpn's down this rule would black hole me right i have no failover when you use enforced it is done if that enforced connection is not there so you need to understand that that is a very uh blunt tool i guess but you know some traffic you only ever wanted on this one vpn or this one connection or you know there are situations where you want that but i think most of the time using the priority rule is a better tool because you've got those options or again using a combination of rules and flowing down through to the next rule is another good good way to kind of deal with some of these things now travis on the uh speed fusion connect would you say if you define the rules under the speed fuse i'm sorry not connect speed fusion cloud if you define the rules under speed fusion cloud are those essentially priority rules or i mean enforced rules um that's a good question let's look here so we've got different uh i i recognize that you can define the rules and everything through the wizard of speed fusion cloud but i think this is a good opportunity to just really quickly let people know the flexibility between the wizard and the outbound policies and the placement of putting those rules above the expert policies for different scenarios yeah so you know the speedfusion cloud ui has some again easy buttons that you don't have for any other connection out there but it lets you do things like you know just pick an application right i just want google workspace to go to this speedfusion cloud node or i just want you know my sharepoint or onedrive or you know teams or whatever the application is right i can just map that to a profile and if you've got multiple profiles set up you know one for one smoothing one for hot failover those will show up here too and you can you know map those applications there individually but um to your question jonathan that that isn't a an enforced rule it's basically a rule that gets kind of squeezed in here in the outbound policy into the middle section yeah area now that's that's the case for cloud applications but if i said i want you to route the wi-fi connection or this specific ip to a tunnel i think it only allows you to do one right yeah that would be already setting yep that would be more of an enforced then yes exactly so yeah this this little gray bar here is kind of the automatic all the stuff that we do automatically is kind of covered inside of this little gray square here and so pep vpn speed fusion by default is a an automatically dynamically routed environment so if you've got five different locations with speed fusion between it it's going to automatically route private ip to private ip right each side is going to have their own subnet and it just automatically shares those routes and knows how to get from you know your office in san diego to your office in texas and so that stuff all happens automatically without needing to set up these outbound policies because it knows okay my source ip is over here and in this office and my destination is some private ip that i know exists over there on the other side of the speedfusion network so it's just going to do that without any any special rules but um these rules are you've got this expert mode so that you can add rules to maybe override that behavior or to just you know flow through down below that behavior so can you can you just add one and show folks uh the um that the need or when you would put it above or below the gray bar because i don't think that's always apparent and why why would you want to do that yeah i mean it's called expert mode for a reason because you know it's just not as common to need to do that but um i guess if you want to talk about situations where you've had to do that i mean there there aren't very many times where i need to do that in my use cases but you know that's a limited uh limited so one of the reasons why you might want to add it above the gray bar is let's say that you have some policies uh designed and implemented in the speedfusion cloud section for example or natively through speed fusion using the ospf route advertisements so if you wanted to test some specific scenario or send traffic out a different wan and you want to override those sections either the speed fusion cloud area or the ospf route advertisements and you want to make sure i need to see um how terrible this wan is acting for this particular scenario for this voip call i want to enforce it to the wired lane or a specific cellular that would be a great scenario where you place it above the expert bar to make sure that there's nothing else interfering with it yep yeah because then you're kind of like skipping that automatic logic and you're just saying nope this this thing has to follow this rule and yeah everything else keep doing the automatic so yeah that again you don't always need that but it's one of those things when you do it's it's really nice to know that you it's just as simple as dragging that rule above that gray bar and so do you i'm sorry do you have any sessions uh up that you can show under active sessions because that's another really great troubleshooting tool where people can actually see am i sending out the weigh-in am i sending out a cellular am i sending it out the vpn tunnel because um people don't know if the rules are even taking effect sometimes like can you show the zoom call for example yep so yeah here's here's the active sessions table so it's just giving you an overview of here's all the different applications we've identified that you're using here's your different interfaces and then if we click on this application like zoom i can see like i said i i told this thing to tunnel everything and so i know right now that it's going through my my fusion hub through that tunnel right i can see every one of these connections so that that's that's your sanity check like like you guys said like you you've gotta you gotta make sure that it's following the rules the way you expected it to reverse right if there's something live that's not working this is a good place to kind of start your investigation number one is it going to the place i expected it to go to if it's not then you got to go back and look at those outbound policies the expert mode some of those things to figure out why it may not be going the way you expected it to but if it is then you know then you know to go a different direction yeah that's a great point too jonathan because we we use it a lot we'll click on sip to make sure all of our zip devices are going out across the speed fusion cloud yep and especially uh it's great for um any any person that doesn't have a lot of experience in the pep link all you have to do is just put in the ip address of the device um that you're trying to figure out where stuff is going and you can immediately see okay it's opening up all these ports going to this direction if you're just not sure um like how to protect an application you might fire up the application go into the active sessions put in your source ip and see all the ports that are are being opened and then try to define some outbound policies around it that's a great destination ip or ports or whatever yeah i'm really glad you mentioned that because i know there was a question earlier about somebody with some like uh bondage business they weren't yeah it doesn't seem like it was going the way they wanted it to and so yeah just step one i i i love that thought is you know step one just see where it does go yep so that you can start the call make a call come in here click that refresh and see what what all the sessions are where they're all going and you'll get some clues about you know why why that rule may not be working the way you expected it to or maybe you missed some little things and some voip providers may use alternate ports it may not be under sip it may not be classified under a specific application but you know just you know starting the call you know starting a data transfer you can go in and use active sessions to help kind of analyze and build your own um protection scheme yeah and i think you know one common mistake that i see a lot of people do too is they'll create an outbound policy for sip but they don't create a policy for the actual audio traffic yeah the rtp right sip is just the the call setup and tear down it's not the actual audio and so it's easy to think you've got your calls protected when you've told sip to go this way but you gotta you gotta figure out what the rtp what the port range is for that because that's usually a wide range and so you need to you know that's where the you know setting rules based on the destination is kind of easy if you have that option you don't have to care if it's sip or rtp but if you don't know what the end ip is with you know vonage would be a good example of that i they may have a hundred different server ips that this thing connects to so i can't probably use that as my as my rule filter so then yeah then i have to figure out what is their you know are they using 50 60 for for sip are they what is their s their rtp port range and so then they can just create a couple policies based on that instead well i think i think we've kind of dove into as much as makes sense for today we can there's always more to talk about with pep lincoln in control and speed fusion but um just really appreciate we've had so many people stay on this long and uh jonathan and gordon especially your folks all the time you guys put into preparing for this and sharing your stories here this has been great yeah no problem i really appreciate you having us enjoyed it well excellent thanks again folks and um just a quick note we are going to start trying to do some more webinars like do some more focus just deep dives on different features different functionalities so we'll have some more overview webinars with with different folks from the industry but we're also going to go start going deep into some different features and functionality and in the systems as well and we'll have guests on as well to to cover those those new features so stay tuned to your email for more more webinars that we'll be scheduling in the future here thanks again and have a good day everybody"}

"transcript": "okay folks looks like we're leveling off thank you all so much for joining we've got a great webinar today in store for you folks we're going to talk about maritime connectivity obviously that's what you guys signed up for but uh most importantly it's not just me here to talk to you folks today we've got a couple of experts here that deal with maritime connectivity day in and day out peplink gets brought into a lot of different markets right we have great technology that solves connectivity problems for just about any scenario but again today we're going to talk about maritime and so we've got two folks that deal with maritime every day so that they can speak more directly to the challenges and and the strategies that you would want to take in a maritime environment when you're trying to optimize your connectivity and so we've got steve mitchell who runs a blog cbits uh he's a pretty hands-on guy he he puts all this stuff in his own in his own vessel and works with a day-to-day and he's got a whole career in technology outside of working with peplink as well and we've also got doug miller who is a peplink reseller a gold partner and again every day he's helping people get connected pick the right solutions and just solve all the little uh surprises that you may run into when you're when you're trying to install these these devices in a marine environment so we've got a handful of topics that we're going to cover today and kind of walk you through this start to finish so that you've got a really good perspective on what what strategies you want to take and what what things you're going to need and so just starting out we're going to look at what is maritime mobile connectivity right what are we talking about here what are people trying to do what are their options we also want to just set expectations there's a lot of different options here and there's a lot of different scenarios or um i guess problems that different users are trying to solve and so there's just a variety of different expectations that people may bring into this conversation when they when they look at how to get connected in a in a maritime environment we're also going to help you just choose a solution right we're going to kind of walk you through those expectations and then start zeroing in on what solutions might be a good fit for this scenario or that scenario and last but not least we're going to show you some real world installations like i said steve and doug these guys are doing this every day on their own as well and so we'll get to show you some of the installations that they've done and how they've tackled some of these problems themselves so really the goals for today number one we just want to get you have you walk away the basic understanding of what we're talking about when mostly in this webinar we're going to talk about the near shore scenarios so you know maritime in itself is a pretty broad category of connectivity right there's all different kinds of vessels and users and you know from the recreational users to the the long-haul shipping type of users there's a lot of different scenarios again that can play out just in the maritime world and today we're really going to focus more so on that that recreational user that near shore user who's not necessarily crossing continents but staying closer to shore and moving up and down the coast will help you figure out how to build a solution that fits your needs and your budget again kind of mapping those expectations to different solutions that will solve those problems and we'll show you what those examples are so like we said we're going to focus on connectivity when you're in the marina right a lot of people are on their boat and they're just there to enjoy it on the water near the water and so you know staying connected when you're in the marina is still a really big deal and actually brings a lot of challenges on its own right even though you're right there next to shore it's not always easy to get connected in a high quality manner even even when you're right there in the marina but obviously you want to take your boat out on the water too and so we'll kind of walk through what those what those connectivity options look like as you get further and further away from the shore one thing to note for today's conversation all three of us are based in the u.s so you know we may talk about u.s carriers u.s frequencies or something more us specific but these concepts are not limited to the us these are these are concepts that can be applied universally but just so you're aware again we're all bringing kind of a us carrier perspective to this conversation so just to keep you keep you aware of that so we'll talk about cellular carrier dependencies and coverage again there's you know in the us we've got three major carriers and each carrier has its own um distinctions and advantages and disadvantages and so we'll talk a little bit about what some of the things you want to think about when you when you're selecting your carrier and i think the the big thing here too is so many people come into this saying i want fast speed right i want fast speed and that's kind of the the intuitive thing that people are looking for but speed is not the same as quality or resiliency and so depending on what you're trying to do when you're in the boat uh speed probably isn't actually the top priority to focus on it it's really about that resiliency and the quality of the connection and of course everybody wants to talk about 5g right 5g is everywhere on the on the news in in advertisements and it's a big deal right there's a lot of advantages that come with it so we're going to talk about specifically how 5g might work and is it ready for for a marine environment so i'm going to hand it over to steve and he can talk a little bit more about the usage and what people what people are trying to do out there yeah thanks very much uh travis and and thanks for setting us up for our discussion today um we're all really passionate about uh the marine side of the world when it comes to connectivity uh and excited to share some of the the different ways we approach solving problems here so knowing your usage so this is one of the the key things to to start with when you're looking at trying to figure out how to get you know reliable connectivity on board i use a phrase that a lot of people have probably heard how do you cruise and how do you use and and what that really means is you need to kind of understand you know how many people you have on board what you're using uh the the internet for right so if we look at that left-hand column there um if you're doing stuff like basic email social media and web browsing that's pretty easy to solve if you're doing what we're doing here today i'm sitting on my boat right now um we're doing a zoom to 160 some odd people that's a little bit different right so you really kind of need to understand you know where you're coming from with how you use it and that really does change the conversation when it comes to the types of equipment that you want to use especially when you get into the cellular plans that you have to pick and that really will will kind of will kind of push you down the chart on the right there um in particular if you absolutely have to work from the boat that would be you know something that you might want to consider calling mission critical right and if you're coastal cruising uh and and with inside of land that makes it more you know easy to solve than you know being offshore or somewhere uh you know in a more difficult location so it's really really important and this is the the first step that doug and i both usually start with when talking to people how are you going to use um the internet and and and what kind of profile does that look like in in terms of your usage the amount of people that you have on board and the different things that you're going to do so really there's three types of connectivity um at the high level that uh that that we're going to be talking about today and you know some of these are things that we're only going to touch on very briefly um the first one at the very top is satellite um the second one is what we are primarily going to focus on is the cellular side of the world and then there's wi-fi and in particular with wi-fi we'll go into a little bit more detail there but we're specifically talking about connecting to a remote wi-fi network somewhere near shore this is one of my favorite things to show people to try to help them understand the difference between things if you're near shore you're probably going to have access to all sorts of different options you can use satellite if you have it you can use cellular you can use wi-fi if you're coastal cruising which is really where we're going to focus most of our discussion today you really have two options you have cellular connectivity lte 5g or satellite if you're offshore cruising you need some sort of satellite setup and we're not going to really talk too much about that today we're going to be focusing pretty much on that middle slice but we'll also be talking about how you can leverage wi-fi if you happen to be in a marina as i am today so doug do you want to take us through options for connectivity thanks steve and uh thanks travis and uh likewise thank you very much for attending today and and hopefully we can pass on some of the knowledge we've gained in helping customers get connected so before we sort of zero in on the discussion around cellular and wi-fi routers and that sort of thing um it's it's worth just looking at what a lot of people have been using up till now if you don't have a cellular router many folks have the you know wi-fi bridges from you know wave or microtech or that sort of thing that works fine except you're really dependent on the quality of the wi-fi at the marina um and of course doesn't cover you when you're as you uh move away from the the hotspot um a lot of folks use their phone or ipad as a hotspot or a pc with a sim card um that that can work well and some of us have been trying to do this for many years have done everything from hoisting a cell phone up a halyard on a sailboat to try to get good coverage uh when we have a hot spot to you know really you know exploring just about every avenue there in combination with cellular boosters and that sort of thing uh lte hot spot devices are are good but you know somewhat limited and many of them can't uh accept external antennas and so they have limited range i get a lot of questions about cellular boosters um i tend to find these work quite well in in very remote places for cell phone calls uh less well for data since they're really only boosting part of part of the connection and uh but still one of those things that that's well worth having uh if you're doing a lot of cell phone communications the other side of that though is if you have good data connections wi-fi calling is becoming more and more par important for for customers who need to make phone calls satellite of course um part of the problem there is it's very expensive um and fairly complex to install but it's it's a moving target and you know with starlink and other stuff coming along i think we're going to see that progress fairly rapidly over the next couple of years and so we're we're going to spend our time talking about cellular plus wi-fi routers and antennas as really the area that we're we're talking about as the main solution set for connectivity and this is really not just one or the other but combinations of cellular and wi-fi together and possibly other wan uh sources for connecting to the internet and so these products we're talking about provide essentially your full network infrastructure for your boat as kind of the foundation so one of the first questions i get from customers when i speak to them when they're just starting out with this is what is this you know cellular wi-fi rotor and i like to break it down into three main functions um these devices are super powerful and do lots and lots of extra functions but the three things that really interest cruisers the most are how do i connect to the internet and then how do i serve the users on my on my boat and so these devices most of what we're talking about today um have cellular modems built in one or two modems and they connect to cell towers and provide a gateway to the internet uh through a cellular connection but um these often also include the ability to connect to a public marina wi-fi or other public wi-fi and use that as your connection pipe to the internet or in fact even combine the two for a little more resiliency and um and set up rules so for instance on my boat um i have it set up that when i'm in the marina it's connected to marina wi-fi i'm selling saving my my cell data minutes um or or bandwidth and when i cruise away it automatically um cuts over to a cell connection and then that's all very very seamless so lots of ways to sort of get that set up for forgetting the initial internet connection and then these devices also provide an access point or be can be connected to an access point to provide essentially the hotspot on your boat your private access point lan that all your users and devices connect to and the router acts as the gateway to the internet for all of those uh users and devices so i think one thing that that i've i've heard a few times now is you know a lot of folks will often start with that hot spot approach right whether it's their phone or a dedicated hot spot and you know more and more they find like okay this one carrier is great but uh i need another carrier now and then they've got another hot spot and it's like all of a sudden they've got multiple hot spots and you know if you've got a smart tv if you've ever tried to program the ssid on a smart tv it's kind of a nightmare right and so all of a sudden you're juggling between different networks and so i think that lan connection that you mentioned doug is is really important and maybe overlooked because it's consistent no matter what you're connected to right mourinho i5 verizon att t-mobile your tv doesn't know the difference or your laptop doesn't know the difference you don't have to change anything on on those devices to switch those networks when you've got a wi-fi router like this i would also say like a lot of customers prefer having a single place to manage everything from i mean we were all kind of fine with having you know one or two hot spots and in your example travis of having to reprogram a tv you know that's a pain but you've it's gotten even more complicated because i mean you don't just have a tv you've got you know a million other devices on board and just having one place to do it all is a huge reason that a lot of people look at an integrated router um when they when they come talking to me yep makes sense yeah i think doug you had some some thoughts on just different considerations of the components in play here um yeah so you know basically from here on we're going to start talking about building a real a real solution for your boat and and we'll kind of finish off with some of the special marine considerations but basically we're we're going to build a solution starting with the router that we just mentioned and then talk about antennas and access points and cabling and that sort of thing and even cell plans because that that's one of the key um things you need to address sometimes even before you you decide what what you're going to buy on the hardware side so we'll move forward here and first of all talk about choosing a router travis do you want to talk about this a bit yeah so you know like i said at the beginning peplin's got all kinds of different products and you know it brings us into a lot of different markets but even in this conversation there's a lot of choices that are relevant depending on you know what what we talked about at the beginning what are your expectations what are you trying to do on on when you're on the move here and so we've got a whole portfolio of different options and that you know at first creates a lot of confusion right because i mean here we are we've got just five different examples on the screen now and it it's just a lot to process for somebody who's new to this this industry and new to this this type of a solution and so the first thing i'll say is we have this variety of products for great for for good reasons right there's different scenarios there's different needs there's different expectations and these come with different price points too of course but um you know we've got some more entry-level devices that get you that kind of basic reliable just web email type of connectivity and then we move up the stack with these dual cellular or integrated antenna and router type combinations and then we've got really high-end devices that you can use for you know multi-radio so we can do two two cellular connections four cellular connections we can go even beyond that with some of our products we won't get into some of those details today but you know there's just so many scenarios and so many so many needs out there that it's not just a one box fits all all types of solutions and so again we'll kind of step you through some of these and kind of pair map out what those expectations and product fits may be so you know i think one of the first things really to talk about is you know a lot of people are here because they've tried to do work in the boat right and it didn't go well or maybe it did go well yesterday but today it didn't go well and so you know that's just a really common experience right cellular is an awesome technology but it's shared and it's dependent on your signal strength and you know there's so many variables in play and so what works today may not work well tomorrow or minute to minute it may fluctuate right there's just again so many variables in play there and so i think for anybody trying to do work on the boat you pretty much have to start looking start your your search with a dual cellular type of solution something with two radios and i think this is there's a it kind of gets into techno mumbo jumbo quickly here but there's a lot of distinctions that are important to be aware of here so people will see a device that has two sim slots and think okay cool i've got i've got two connections well probably not you have one connection and you have a blind handoff to that second connection so only one can be on at a time and it's going to interrupt and disconnect you as it switches over to that other one and you don't know what the quality of that other one may be and so again it's kind of just a blind handoff you don't really know what you're going to get on the other side but you know you're going to get disconnected when you do make that switch and so that can be useful for people that again they're not doing live video they're not doing live calls you know just being able to kind of run out of one carrier's connectivity or coverage footprint and switch over to another one yeah maybe you don't need that to to hand off sub second and seamlessly on your video call if you're just doing email right you can handle that minute or two switching time no big deal but again for those of us trying to do work that that's not going to be an acceptable solution you have to have that that redundancy that clean hand off and so that's where a dual radio or a dual modem router comes in in peppling's case our our radios each have two sim slots so you can do that kind of cold or blind handoff between those two sim cards but then when you've got two radios that gives you up to four sim cards that you can use at once and so you've got two active at the same time so you can do that seamless switching back and forth another important point to mention there is there are other products out there that have two radios right they have those two active simultaneous connections but the really important detail here is they don't work the same way that peplink does they're not able to use those two radios the same way that peplin does public has something called speedfusion so speedfusion is our software technology that looks at all the available connections and then it evaluates the quality of each connection real time and we're able to split that traffic up at the packet level so on a typical router or a another company's router they may have those two connections but how they work is when you open up your zoom call it's going to look at those connections right at that split second and say okay yep t-mobile's got the best connection right now send that zoom call out t-mobile but cellular is dynamic right maybe maybe a whole bunch of people just got on the network and started doing things on t-mobile that weren't happening right when you started that zoom call so now your connection quality degrades it slows down starts breaking up those other dual cellular routers aren't able to react to that once they've established that connection that's where your connection lives and dies and it can only switch over when it gets interrupted so again you've got that other connection there but it's still not going to work simultaneously to protect those real-time applications and so that's what peplink does different because we're able to inspect those real time for the duration of your call and shift that sub second right in the middle of your call and so we've got different strategies you know with calls you want it as smooth and clean as possible right it's not about speed it's about the quality the consistency and so that's what we've got what we call land smoothing for but sometimes it's just a simple device that you just don't want it to get disconnected right if you've got some device it just needs to stay online right we can do hot failover so you've got that sub second hand off it's only going to use one at a time but it's able to switch uninterrupted to that second connection if that if that first one isn't working as well and we've also got bandwidth bonding when you do need to just upload a whole bunch of files or download a whole bunch of files that's where you need that raw speed it's not as much about the consistency in that situation so we can use those two links at the same time to grab those big files or upload those big files so if you're trying to upload a bunch of photos or upload a drone video that's where bandwidth bonding comes in and so the best best thing about speedfusion is you can use all of these at the same time intelligently so that each application gets treated the way that it optimizes it instead of picking one or the other and kind of uh not choosing the best solution for each application so this is an application based strategy that we can apply real time to whatever it is that you're doing i i want to interject to you on speed fusion and a multi excuse me multi modem routers that is the single best and biggest feature that's enabled me to work remotely for as long as i have period um i mean having multiple connections to multiple cellular providers is great but if you can't use that and leverage that it doesn't really matter and peplink is the only one that has that kind of software feature that you know basically like what i'm doing right now i don't i i'm connected and i don't really care um about which providers i'm using because i have you know three cellular connections and speed fusion takes care of that for me um there is nothing worse than being in a video meeting with an employee and having your cellular connection disconnect right when they're talking about something you know really sensitive and having to apologize that your boat moved or something like that so that technology is is is is the main enabler at least for me being able to work remotely and it's it's really really important to consider when you're looking at a solution yeah i would encourage everybody to look at steve's blog his c bits blog that's you know steve was aware of peplink before i was aware of him but that that's how i came to know steve was i just stumbled on his blog and he has a great article just really specifically talking about how he works from the boat and you know how he configures the settings and and why it's important to him and so i would really encourage you folks to go and just read through that because it's a really common sense explanation right it's not a technical article it's it's just really focused on how do we solve this problem and make it easy to work from the boat and so that was that was a fun surprise when i when i found that blog it was really the i think the the cleanest simplest description of kind of what the whole point of speed fusion is for a lot of people thanks uh this is uh doug i'm just gonna jump in and also mention of course this also applies to a wi-fi connection so if you're in a marina and you have connections to the the marina wi-fi that are okay but not necessarily super great you can bind those with cellular connections um to sort of smooth out the connection between the two um and i even have some customers who've bought two modems or two routers and and simply daisy chained them together so that they have one uh they've effectively built their own dual modem system um so it's really you know there's lots of options for for doing this but the important thing is that you know you can get the sort of resilient resiliency you need for for doing mission critical work so i guess i'll i'll uh talk a bit about 5g and then hand over to steve um this is a question i get every single day you know we hear about 5g i've got an iphone or an android phone with 5g can i get a rudder with 5g and the answer is yes you can and um and surprisingly even with with all of the questions about how far can can 5g really travel when i'm you know offshore and that sort of thing it does work surprisingly well and um haven't used a 5g peplink device now myself on my own boat for almost a year um i wouldn't go back to lte only um because i i definitely see the speed benefits with 5g and surprisingly in our area up here in the pacific northwest um i i've seen times when i've had 5g coverage even when i'm cruising up in the islands and quite far from a cell tower and part of this is because you know what we'll talk about next is um matching this this router with a really good antenna but um there's lots of questions about where is 5g going you know what about the next generation 5g carrier regulation with 5g all that sort of thing yes it's it's a moving target but i think for people who want you know super high quality high speed uh internet connectivity today these solutions work extremely well and will work for years a couple of years from now we may see other developments that will replace these but personally i don't think it's going to happen anytime soon with all of the work that has to go into building a 5g solution getting that certified on the care on each carrier so yeah and i think you know one of the things that i remind people about too with 5g is you know it may not even be available in your area right now right the carriers have to roll this out there's a huge you know lift and expense to deploy this technology but at worst these 5g devices are just awesome 4g modems too so when they're not in 5g coverage they fall back to category 20 lte which is basically the fastest lte modem possible so you know again at its worst you've got a great 4g device and it's going to be ready for 5g when that coverage is in your area or when you move to an area that it is in so you're not kind of uh you're not throwing money at a at an invisible game there it's going to benefit you on the 4g side just as much as when you're in the 5g coverage and i think the the rule of thumb that i always use is that if you're going out to buy technology you would always want to buy the the best that's available you wouldn't buy you know a cat 12 router just because you're worried about 5g stuff you know changing in two years or in a year if you've already got a cat 18 router it's a little bit more difficult decision as to should i just jump to 5g um you know with cat 18 you've already got band 71 support which uh you know for around here for t-mobile and those sorts of things is is great um if you're in the market for something new or if you've got an older piece of equipment there's absolutely no reason why you shouldn't consider a 5g router because you know you're kind of you know protecting your investment and when you do get 5g coverage it's much faster i've seen similar to doug especially around this area t-mobile is really good you know 250 megabits of download and 110 upload which is pretty darn nice to have uh when you're sitting in the middle of of nowhere uh participating in zoom meetings uh but it falls back like like both of uh both doug and travis have mentioned so you know if if you're like i said if you've already got a fairly complex infrastructure or if you've already got a cat 18 router um you know you obviously have to do a little bit more uh thought behind should you jump on the 5g train now or wait uh and and do something a little bit later but it's definitely viable technology and very very fast and i think the last thing that i'll throw out there in favor of a 5g device today is you know for anybody who's crossing international borders right for years you've had to be really specific about which devices you bought depending on which regions you're going to right because different networks around the world use different frequencies and they're you know they're just they have different strategies for how they how they get people connected and the 5g devices are the most global devices we sell so they these are a single skew truly global device and so if you've got a 5g device in your boat you've got the best connectivity possible as you do cross those international borders and use carriers that you you may not use uh when you're in your home country and so you've just got even more compatibility when you use the 5g devices versus the 4g devices so i'll jump over to antennas now because really all of this is great but it's only as good as the weakest link in the chain and so the antenna is really the linchpin in terms of staying connected especially when you get further and further from that cellular tower and so uh having a having a high quality high performance antenna is an absolutely critical piece to this puzzle right our devices come with the little uh stick antennas right that screw on and just kind of sit inside and if all you're ever going to do is sit in the marina that that'll probably work fine right that's probably going to be just just fine but again the further you get away from shore the more important that these these antennas are and you know with 5g again every antenna is not the same you have to have 5g optimized antennas because 5g covers so many different frequencies so you have to have antennas that are designed to cover that range and designed to perform well at the bottom and the top of those frequencies right you've got really low frequencies that cover really far and then you've got these really high frequencies that give you all this speed and capacity and you've got to be able to be optimized on both of those to have a good clean experience as you go about and so you know pep link a couple of years ago we really we really realized that we needed to invest more more effort into our our antennas right in the past we didn't have our own antenna line we've worked with third parties or maybe we white labeled some stuff but we realized you know we're selling into so many specialty markets that we really need to focus in on what users need in each different market and really create antennas that are designed to match up with with the devices that we're selling so that it's the best possible experience every time and so that's what that's what we did we invested in in dedicated resources to create our own design our own antenna product line and we worked with people who are experts in these different industries so we have maritime specific antennas that work great for those scenarios right there's there's nuances and reasons why you need a different antenna for a maritime environment versus you know a kiosk that's sitting in a stadium right they're just two totally different situations and so i'm just really pleased to see the results now we've got again these maritime antennas we've got mobility antennas we've got iot antennas and they all just work great right we've got a lot of people in these industries that are giving us just great reviews great feedback and i think the best thing is we're not done right we've got these antennas but you know we're still collecting tons and tons of feedback from people in the maritime industry so that we can keep making more antennas keep coming up with even better solutions out there and so again just don't don't ignore the antenna it might be the the least interesting part of the part of the solution but oftentimes it might be the most important part at the same time there's all kinds of details that i'll let doug and steve get into when it comes to choosing an antenna and getting that antenna connected so we'll talk a little bit about some examples some mounting examples and this is really just touching the tip of the iceberg here but um there there are kind of two strategies with antennas you can go with these dome form factor style antennas uh the mobility series um these are you know when you want a low profile antenna but still get uh some some decent gain from the external antenna um or you have a high speed vessel uh these are great i mean they're um nice small form factor but but still give you huge performance advantages uh peplink have designed some specific mounting options for these that address the marine industry so over on the left here we have the acw 652 it's a really just a standard one inch 14 thread per inch mount this could be any mount this could be a shakespeare ratchet mount or whatever and secondly there's this collar essentially it fits on and then you can fit your mobility antenna on there so you can see in the second picture an example of mounting that on a rail um and getting it outside the boat to optimize the connection um the third picture is is uh kind of a solution i threw together when these first came out on my own sailboat um put it on a morad extension pole uh five foot pole on my davit system on the sailboat and was able to get the antenna nice and high and most importantly free and clear of of other obstacles around it and so this is what i sailed with for about nine months got fabulous reception in places i had no business getting reception up in the san juan islands and back bays there um down in the south sound uh worked extremely well uh again you want to get these away from a lot of other metal clutter and that'll give you the best chance of getting a good signal i've recently replaced it in the the next picture with the the new 40g the maritime 40g and have been testing that out the similar sort of idea on a pole on the stern rail this is a big antenna but boy does it work really well so i'm looking forward to testing this some more this summer and then finally a you know typical power boat mounting system up on an arch or an antenna ray system again you want to get this in a place where it's it's not too close to other antennas um and out of the path of radar and things like that so just keep in mind you know it's not just antenna separation it's also metal structure of any type it's going to do some somewhat uh some blocking of the signal so keeping it free and clear is is definitely a big priority so you know coupled with this are antenna cables and that's you know probably one of the most important areas which is you know you need a cable running to your antenna but it needs to be relatively short i've included a little calculator from times microwave on the right here and you can go and look at this yourself you can see as we're talking about these high frequencies with cellular like up in the 5000 range you know a long cable length run of say 30 feet um with lmr 195 style antenna cable is is really not going to work you you've got a way too much loss so the goal is to get your router as close as possible to the antennas and there's lots of creative ways of doing that um some people have put them in unused satellite domes some put them in waterproof enclosures and lazarettes and things like that but try to keep your cable run probably no more than 20 feet if it's going to be longer than that then you have to seriously start thinking about lmr 400 and other higher um length uh scenarios for for your cables that that will be able to withstand the loss that's going to happen at these higher frequencies i think there's always that uh you know people are used to coaxial cable right from tv over the air or maybe two-way radios right and those are low frequencies and so they they run over those cables really well they don't have that loss like like you see on the these these lte and 5g signals and so there's always that um kind of knee-jerk reaction like oh we'll just run along cable to it and that can be a huge mistake you can completely cancel out all the gain your antenna has and really work backwards almost even from what you had with that little stick antenna directly connected so these details matter a lot unfortunately i mean it's just a lot of layers to consider but again that's why we've got people that do this every day and understand these trade-offs and that's why we partner with these people to to help people find the right solution without having to become an expert in cabling and antennas and lte and all these different layers i'd say the number one challenge or mistake i see with with most of the installs that maybe didn't follow the suggestions is in antenna cabling and in antenna placement um you know using high quality cable is a must i would never go over 20 25 feet no matter what the cable is somebody asked in qa in the or in the question and answers uh can we put it at the top of a sailboat mast no i would never do that there's lots of interference up there from vhf antennas led anchor lights plus you've got all the power wires and all the things that it needs to go by plus it's just too long it used to be back in the day if you were using a wi-fi booster that getting it as high as possible was important so that you had better line of sight and for cellular you're dealing with such small improvements in terms of the the gain from an antenna it needs to be as close to the router as possible so it's really important to make sure that you don't cut corners there yeah there's always the the trade-off i mean antennas aren't pretty right they're just kind of they're just there and so there's always the aesthetics versus performance thing too right i mean aesthetics matter especially when somebody spent a lot of money on the both they've got right they want it to look good and so there's kind of a natural conflict there sometimes and so it's just something to consider right there's good there's great places to put an antenna there's terrible places to put an antenna in so sometimes you have to find a balance between you know the looks and the performance there and and find that right fit but yeah you can't always put it in the most optimal location either right sometimes aesthetics are way a little heavier on the scale than the performance does but just being aware of those trade-offs i think is the biggest thing to to keep in mind yeah so one of the things that um i always want to bring up when talking with somebody is is wi-fi um when or wi-fi as when what that is is it's the ability for a router or device to connect to a local wi-fi network and use that as a source of internet um i'm actually connected right now to two wi-fi networks and three cellular networks and by default those two wi-fi networks where i am here are being used for the majority of of the session today for me to to participate um it saves you data right i mean we all have data plans yes some of us have unlimited cellular data plans but there's still limits to those unlimited plans they slow you down at a certain point or there's other challenges or in the case of where i am near seattle in a particular marina the cellular coverage here is abysmal so wi-fi is is almost required for that um so when you're thinking of a solution you you want to also think about having uh potentially having an external antenna that specifically to grab remote wi-fi and using that particular feature to pull in that wi-fi network and have that be your primary source combined with a cellular modem somebody asked in the q a as well i you know speed fusion isn't you know going to work for me on my br1 pro 5g it actually will because you could use wi-fi as when in this example connect to a local wi-fi network still have your 5g connection running as well use speed fusion to combine those and both of those will be used so that you're always connected and and you know make make sure that you're not having any sort of outage while while you're while you're dealing with that so it's it's not just good enough to to say okay i'm going to use wi-fi as when it's something when we talk about a design we actually may suggest having a dedicated antenna for that and not using the access point on the router itself yeah there can be a trade-off there if you're you know that that that br one pro 5g it has a a single wi-fi radio and so you can connect that to the the wi-fi as when you can connect that to the marina wi-fi and then you can also use it to get your devices connected but there's limits to what what you can do in that situation right it's going to kind of it has to share its time between connecting to the the marina and then connecting to the laptop and so it's it's kind of going back and forth back and forth right it's kind of relaying everything and that's that's chewing up at at best half of its time and if if the signal is not great then it just kind of degrades further and further so again this kind of comes back to what your expectations and your use cases are if you're just doing web browsing yeah use it use it for both that's probably going to be okay but if you start getting more devices and more more demand then you need to start looking at how you kind of separate those two functions well and and i think one of the things that i see a lot of a lot of what i spend time doing outside of the cellular world is marinas and wi-fi setups within marinas marinas are one of the worst places in the world to try to get wi-fi working correctly because there's all these other wi-fi networks from every chart plotter and vesper ais device and then you've got metal and glass and big stick things on these sailboat things that are always in my way going slowly uh and that all causes huge amounts of interference so even if you aren't you know going to put an outdoor antenna for wi-fi to do that you're going to you're still going to be dealing with all that interference and it is a challenge there were two related q and a's one was what about public wi-fi with captive portal for wi-fi access yes you can use wi-fi swan for that and there's steps to do that so it's definitely something to look at and the way we usually recommend folks address that is use the radio on the router to get that remote wi-fi um pulled into the router and into your environment and then use an access point on the boat dedicated to serving you know the local clients and people and devices and everything that are there um one of the things it did come up as a q a as well i already answered it there there are a lot of folks that don't realize that the pepwave routers actually will manage and control this access point you don't need another you know piece of software you don't need an extra license you don't have to go log into something else it's all controlled from that same central point so it can be very very convenient doug did you have any comments on this particular um yeah so this is definitely my preferred recommended route to use a separate access point in the cabin and dedicate your router to the external communications um if you get a chance go to our site onboardwireless.com and i've got a blog area and i have a whole article uh about how to manage your your peplink access point from your router or individually so there you can do everything from just plug them in and and have the router configure it or or actually manage it yourself so lots of good options there i think in the interest of time we'll keep pushing forward and i'll talk a little bit more and see will as well about how we've used access points on our own boats so let's jump ahead and this next slide is really just kind of a um a a you know a concept slide of of putting an hd dome hd1 or hd2 on the top of a sailboat mast in reality this is pretty hard to do on a sailboat that has you know vhf antennas and led anchor lights and uh wind vanes and all sorts of things up there um one scenario that i've been looking at for a couple of customers and has worked well is putting it on a mizzenmast if you have one or on an arch on the on the davits that case you're getting it away from all the other clutter and this can work well to get the radio and the antennas in a single place and minimize loss because that communication pipe from the the dome down to the sim injector or the switch down in your cabin um can be is is ethernet and essentially is lossless so um won't go into a lot of detail about this particular solution but this is another way to to look at it it is one of the more popular solutions that we see though because of the simplicity and not having to deal with antennas but yeah we're not going to talk a great deal about it today oh i'm just going to say the important thing is is that you can put this dome literally anywhere and just have a single ethernet cable run down to your power over ethernet inserter or the sim injector and manage the device from from below but have literally zero loss between the uh the dome and the rest of your your network okay yeah you basically said exactly what i was gonna say it's a good balance when you've got that too long of a cable run situation if if that's what you're faced with the dome might be the better choice right i think the dome as an antenna itself it isn't as good as some of those maritime antennas but when you factor out the the lack of cable to lose signal depending on the situation and the location you may come out ahead with the dome versus a dedicated maritime antenna so just more trade-offs to consider i mean again nobody said this was going to be easy right but again we've got people that understand it and can navigate you you through these things in your scenario so speaking of rabbit holes and and the places to get stuck and need an expert um can you guys just talk a little bit about cellular data plans because i think this is really often overlooked as well as another yet another challenge or roadblock for people trying to trying to stay connected yeah i i mean this to me is the first question you need to answer before you even purchase hardware i mean you could have the best hardware in the world but if you don't have adequate plans if you buy a duo router with the dual modems and you have a single sim card you're not you're not going to get any of the benefits of that dual dual dual modem and the challenge is for us you know we we try to recommend what we've used and what we've seen but it's a constantly changing landscape um the carriers will offer a plan and then they won't offer it they'll offer it in one part of the us and not not elsewhere they don't tell you that they do but it ends up that way and then there's challenges getting them activated and most of the carriers don't understand what a lot of this gear is peplink is very prevalent in pushing through certifications and getting that that done with the different carriers but their frontline folks that you talk to are selling cell phones they're not dealing with routers so it's really important that you find good plans um and make sure you that you have you know back to that first slide that we talked about way back when which is where do you cruise and how do you use if you're gonna be constantly streaming netflix then you're gonna need to invest some time and effort in finding really good plans um you know that that can that can support that habit you know we we usually recommend anything that has to do with a hot spot or router plant those are the best trying to tag a plan on to something that you already have from a personal cell phone perspective usually creates a lot more more issues but doug i don't know if you want to add to that well i think one thing is uh you know as steve said do some research steve has a great article on this i have an article focused exclusively on how to choose a cell plan there's other folks out there like the mobile and internet info folks uh that have articles on this as well so do your research one of the big things in our area is also knowing what the policy is for roaming because if you go up to canada you want to make sure that your your system continues to work up there and also be sure that you know how to use wi-fi land because you may find up in canada or the bahamas or whatever um that connecting to wi-fi hotspots will actually be the method of choice uh in order to save dollars on on cell plants so let's uh let's keep moving because we're we're starting to get close to our end time here i'm going to throw one more comment here on data plans perfect okay um so you know we've talked about kind of if you're trying to do work from the boat you need two cellular connections right and to some people that's just an insane proposition right it's like okay i went through all this all this research and headache and i picked whichever carrier i picked right i found the right plan for me but now you're telling me i have to go do that again and do all that with another carrier and spend you know spend the money on yet another connection and so some to some people that's kind of the the limit that they're willing to go to and so um just a couple weeks ago we launched something called speed fusion connect and so that's a that's a data plan that's available on some of our newest devices that is really a a data plan of convenience so if you've got that first data plan that's going to be your primary connection right you found the lowest cost per gig you found the package that's going to fit your usage that's great but when you're trying to do those video calls that second connection is really important and so you know that speed fusion connect connection may not be great for your primary connection but if you're using it only for wand smoothing to only protect zoomer teams that might make a lot more sense right all of a sudden that that makes more sense because you don't have to pay for it every month and spend all that extra money if you're an absolute power user and you're working from the boat every day it's probably worth your investment to to get those two dedicated cell plans direct from a carrier but just so people are aware we have a new option on some of the new devices to kind of help take away the pain of that that second connection research and cost so i think to sum all this up there's just a lot to consider here right i mean there are so many boxes that you need to check when you look through and really try to find the right fit to do what you're trying to do and so again we've got experts just like steve and doug here to help you folks navigate through that they've got great content they write all kinds of articles to help you navigate this and so you got to do a little research and when you're fed up with research we we've got the right people to to help you step through that and figure out how to how to check these boxes without having to figure it all out yourself so doug did you want to get into these sure so i'll talk a little bit about how i have my solution set up on my sailboat although it's constantly changing but uh over on the left-hand side here you can see i have a typical sailboat you know where do you put an antenna so that it can be free and clear of all the clutter uh stays masts booms things like that so i mounted a poll on my davit system you can see it on the second picture there and put a peplink mobility 42g which is a combo uh lte 5g antenna with dual dual wi-fi elements plus gps so um sort of covers all the bases and from that i have about 15 feet of cable leading into my aft cabin where i have a br1 pro 5g connected and then i have an ethernet cable into my forward cabin the main salon area and there i have a separate access point so if we go to the next slide this sort of lays it out in a little more detail and this is a pretty typical setup for a recreational boat regardless of whether you have a sailboat or a powerboat you have your your main router as the foundation uh in this case i'm using the br1 pro 5g um i have the mobility 42g connected to that or it could be using for instance the 40g the new maritime 40g if i really want to prioritize getting the absolute best um long-range connectivity on cellular and then i have my ethernet cable led to the forward cabin so something like this is sort of our bread and butter this is what most of our customers start with something like this and you can you can actually build on this uh adding additional access points or different antenna strategies but this is a good um straightforward way to start and i would also say the access point is kind of optional um it really depends on your boat and the size of the boat and the the build of the boat so in some cases just starting with the router and the antenna is a great way to start your solution so now we come to my insane setup so i have a core router in the mbx mini 5g which is on the right hand side there that is a dual 5g router with dual wi-fi it's got two wan ports four uh lan ports of which they are all power over ethernet and a lot of other great features it is pretty new to the market and is extremely fast so it's got a lot of good horsepower under the hood in there so i have two maritime 40g antennas connected to that for the two cellular radios that are in that and then i also have a third party 4x4 antenna connected to what you see below that which is the max adapter 5g that is an additional 5g radio that i have plugged into a usb port on that and then i'm showing a max hd1 dome i have a cat18 dome plugged into one of the lan ports but really for this solution this is this is designed for somebody who is doing lots of work from the boat that needs to be connected all the time that needs a high performing solution so i have a dome but i also um oftentimes will have a satellite connection connected to one of those lan ports as well uh and then the other two antennas that you see there are the maritime 20g and i have those connected to the wi-fi ports on this router and so i'm not using the wi-fi directly on the router itself for the local network i'm using those two antennas to grab those two remote wi-fi networks that i'm currently connected to and then inside i have a switch with a couple of access points and then a sim injector connected that allows me to use different sim cards in different place places there throughout that architecture so this is what i would consider to be a complex yacht setup for a fairly decent sized boat i'm about 60 feet uh you could you know lop off a few things if you were on a smaller boat um but this is you know a fairly expensive solution that's designed for um being connected all the time in a pretty high intensity situation hey steve why don't you talk about the sim injector a little bit and how that works oh yeah yeah so the sim injector is a fantastic product um it it came into being with the domes uh and if you have a dome it can actually power the dome it comes as a bundle with the dome if you buy it actually correctly which i'm sure doug knows the part number but the sim injectors purpose in life is that it holds eight sim cards and you can then assign those to different devices that are connected to it so in my case here i have the mbx mini and the dome and i can switch between whatever sim cards i want to use just that are all housed in that sim injector just by typing a few things into each of those so that means i don't have to run upstairs to the router move sim cards around put things in different places i have the sim injector down in the pilot house and i can pop different sims in and out and it it for the domes i highly recommend it because you don't want to be going up and opening up a dome every time you need to change a sim card but for these bigger installations as well it's super nice to be able to have that in one place and be able to use sims all around for me obviously for testing it's also fantastic so steve i think you just published an article on your blog that goes into a lot more detail on all this as well i do yeah yeah and including some background on why i chose the mbx mini and the wi-fi as wand stuff and and the different performance pieces you know there there's a lot of people who have already commented on it and said well why can't i just buy a br1 pro 5g you can and that's a fantastic product and that was what i had prior to this but i i need multiple multiple connections uh so i you know this is really kind of that high-end uh piece that you can put into place you don't have to have all of these things but starting with the mba x mini and a couple of really good outside lte antennas and you have a top of the line solution that you can build on really easily yeah it just comes down to you know where where you're going and if you want it to work every single time no matter where you are there you know you just you end up finding those those gaps or those uh you know places where you just need a little bit more and you know it can add up for sure i'm not saying it it's the right fit for for everybody but for some people it's completely worth it right they're they're on you know very important you know very uh consequential business meetings and if that's the case and you want to do that in in a very remote location you might have to spend some money to get there but i think the thing that a lot of people overlook too is you know they spend a lot of times people spend i'm not saying the exact amount is this setup but you know they look at the cost of of one of these solutions and they say that's just too much money i'm just gonna get a hot spot and they end up spending just about that much money just with trial and error right they buy this thing you know it didn't work okay they bought this thing it didn't work and so again i would just encourage people to really kind of do the research and think about you know how much effort do you want to spend fiddling with all this and instead of just kind of finding the right fit for what you're trying to do i think yeah yeah that's it go ahead doug yeah i was just going to say the other you know key thing with this solution is is the dual win and in fact you have you ultimately have four possibilities for wan coming in on ethernet uh two usb ethernet and to uh ethernet lan ports um and and this becomes important as other new technologies come along so let's say starlink finally get their act together and you can do starlink on a boat um that could be plugged into the wan port on the mbx mini here and you can have a dome plugged in on the other lan port and the the key thing here is that this is your central controller for your whole network infrastructure the the mbx mini it can control you know which path you take to the internet based on application type based on quality of service based on lots and lots of different rules and that gives you lots of flexibility for for growth in the future yeah and you know doug i think that's a great point because what you just said actually applies on the br1 pro 5g as well right i mean that's got a single 5g connection it's got the wi-fi one option so there's two and then it's got that ethernet port so that's a third when whether that ends up being starlink or an hd one dome right you've got the ability to kind of build on that base of that that br1 pro 5g without looking at you know five figure type of type of price ranges so it creates kind of a a baseline platform that you can build on even with that uh much lower initial investment than something like this yeah yeah i think i'd like to say one final thing on like cost in general um i and doug and i have had many conversations about this but we have a lot of people you know when they come in and they say oh my god i'm not going to pay 1500 for the br1 pro 5g and then they go off and do what you mentioned travis which is try a bunch of different things and then come back and buy it looking at something like this you know this is significantly more expensive and usually i'm at a boat with somebody working on this at the same time they're doing other work and i hear that they're spending ninety thousand dollars on garmin chart plotters and fifteen thousand dollars on new you know wiring in these areas and they balk at a fifteen hundred dollar router if internet is not that important to you then that's fine if it's one of the five top things on the boat that you're using which it usually is you need power you need it not to sync you need some sort of internet connectivity you need engines to go places then then make sure that you understand that just like everything else in the marine world this stuff is not like buying a 99 router on amazon you're not gonna get the same uh performance and usability out of it and it's a smaller market so pep link doesn't ship nine billion routers a moment right so it costs more to manufacture and make so you have to pay more for it and you get what you pay for yeah and i think the last point on the get you get what you pay for is i don't know any other vendor out there in the industry that supports their devices longer than pep link and i'm talking software support firmware updates right we we maintain support so much longer than any other router vendor out there and so you know it it's a big investment but it's also one that that we don't just run away from as soon as the next technology comes out right we we work as hard as we can to keep those things in support and and current so that they are still useful so i think we've gone a little bit over time here but i'm i'm able to stay on and help answer questions um doug and steve you're welcome to stay on as well and so i just want to kind of open it up to the floor but number one just thank you everybody for spending the time here if you can't stay and thank you doug and steve for sure this is this is awesome to have all this ground level information but yeah i think we can open it up i'll scan the i've answered 34 i think so far or maybe you've been answering too but i've been trying to answer a lot of them um i know there was one uh at the very top that you might want to answer travis that had to do that was from christopher george okay let me look here yeah okay oh yeah so this is a great question because there's a lot of buzz around 5g and hardware capabilities and you know generations of 5g right we're just kind of right beginning to see 5g deployed but there's already kind of new generations of chipsets out there so i think a couple points on that number one routers are kind of the last devices to get chipsets in in the cellular industry right iphones and androids they're the first ones to get it right they're the ones buying millions and millions and millions of units right they've got the the latest and greatest technologies locked up for a year or two guaranteed right out of the gate and so yeah you're gonna see a phone with a newer generation chipset than than you'll see a router with every time right that's almost guaranteed and so there's really no way around that number one um number two it's going to take time right these module vendors have spent a ton of money and a ton of effort to get these 5g modules out there when they did have access to them and so they're you're not going to see these next generation modules commercially available i don't think until probably late 2023 early 2024 just the the life cycle of these products is not a flash in the pan right these module vendors invest tons of money hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars just in certifications alone forget the manufacturing cost right so they've got a life cycle that they have to kind of let play out before they're gonna see you're gonna see a new generation of devices out there and then on top of that we have to then go get those devices certified on top of the modules and the chipsets getting certified so there's a whole sequence of things that have to take place before you can actually buy it and you know on top of all that oh yeah it has to get manufactured too right so there's just there's just a big lag in the router industry compared to what you see in the cell phone industry so you know you'll see data sheets and you'll see press releases but again the commercial availability the reality is it's going to be quite a while before you see those next generation chipsets actually showing up in the router market at all so you know like we said there's there's tons of reasons why 5g works great today and maybe today's routers aren't the latest generation of 5g chipsets but they do a heck of a lot more than the latest generation lte chipsets so i don't think you're going to be really missing anything for for quite a while if you if you jump onto 5g right now again it's going to be a handful of years before you really start to see another generation of that in the router market there are a couple questions um i think it was asked about three times i tried to answer them but i figured you probably would be the better one to answer specifically about um the road map uh and in particular the dome uh is there gonna be a 5g dome and any other details behind that yeah yeah absolutely so we did a business update webinar a couple of weeks ago which is you know usually it's more partners that attend that and so i'm guessing there's a lot of new people here that that weren't there on on that webinar but we did we did announce there's going to be a 5g version of the dome um i think that's probably going to be available sometime sometime summertime i'm guessing um it's going through the manufacturing side we've got the certification side still to go through so there's going to be a little bit of a lag lag there still but absolutely there is a 5g dome coming but it's kind of more like mid-year i would say it's not going to be a next month or or the next two months i don't expect but definitely we understand we 5g domes are very important to the people out there yeah i mean we talked about the domes in the slides and we kind of breezed by it um a little bit but they are very very popular um i was just think talking to doug earlier this morning and the dock that i'm on there's five installs that that um that i've done there's seven installs total but five of them are domes they're just so much easier to install in a lot of cases um so yeah seeing a 5g version obviously will be will be great for people so they can take advantage of that yeah i see one question from a mark out there he said he's got an old br1 mini kind of interested in the beer the beer one pro 5g um sounds like you're having troubles keeping the wi-fi consistently connected i guess i'll say two things kind of two contrasting things here number one there's a huge difference in the wi-fi that's built into the br1 pro 5g versus the br1 mini the br1 mini is 11n single stream which means it just has one antenna and it's 2.4 gigahertz only which 2.4 gigahertz is the freak the the spectrum on wi-fi most likely to get congested and interfered with so you've kind of got three three negative aspects to the the wi-fi on the br1 mini if you look at the beer one pro 5g it's wi-fi six so it's the latest generation of wi-fi it's it's a mimo antenna strategy so you've got just more resiliency and you're able to overcome interference a little bit better and it's dual frequency so it's 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz so you there's a lot of aspects to the to the br1 pro 5g that are very much superior to the br1 mini and so those things alone might be enough to allow you to continue using just that one device instead of having to separate it to a an external access point but at the same time when you get more speed on that br1 pro 5g you might still find the need to add that second access point so i'd say start with start with the device only but just understand you might still want to upgrade to add a second access point there to separate those two i'm looking for other ones here i think doug and i are both frantically typing as well yeah one other point about the dome um and i've had several customers do this and have been very creative and sort of getting the benefits of the dome but with the current technology and that is um using unused satellite domes that are on their their large vessels um basically putting the router in there in some cases putting antennas in there as well or putting the antennas side by side on the on the arch beside the the satellite dome um it's a great way to get the antennas very close um get super high quality antennas up high get it to the router and then run ethernet down to the access point in the cabin so there there are lots of ways to sort of get the benefits of a dome concept with today's technology and certainly if you if you contact either steve or myself we'd be happy to help map that out for you i see another question about uh different generations of our products and the footprints that those are in um is peppery going to stop changing footprints of the different modem devices how soon until we have a 1u type standard for hardened devices so the answer is sometimes we do change them and sometimes we don't um you know it's it's a challenging thing we very much understand that you know people want to have this kind of a generational replacement right and so you know some there's plenty of examples of where we followed that and kept been able to keep that exact same footprint like if you followed us years ago we had a device just called the hd4 that was our four radio device and then we came up with the hd4mbx the mbx looks different right it's a different color it's a different material but it's the exact same footprint all the antenna connections are in the same locations and so in that case that new generation device was a drop-in replacement it's a 1u device to a 1u device exact same footprint just a little bit different look our transit products are also going through a hardware life cycle change right now and those will have the exact same footprint as well so we definitely try to maintain that footprint but sometimes it's a different product and it's a different footprint and so you know it's not always possible for us to do that but at the same time we do appreciate that that is important especially when you're you're trying to kind of upgrade and keep keep your installation clean and insane from one generation to the next but sometimes we just can't do it right sometimes you just can't get all the new components in there or for whatever reason but but we do appreciate that and try to try to maintain that wherever possible see a a question from captain ed harvey both in q a and in chat and i'm not sure that we can answer this but what is the power output of a max br1 mark ii i assume that's power output um maybe you can reply back to your own comment but power output of the lte side or you asking how much power it uses so i don't know that we can answer that without a bit more information there on the cellular side i can just say it's 250 milliwatts that's uh you know in the us that's an fcc mandated limit so you can't have a cellular device higher than that um on the wi-fi side i can try and find that depends on the which version it is right i can't remember what it is off the top of my head uh samuel you ask a question uh is there any pebbling partners with marine experience in the southeast versus puget sound southeast of the united states i assume uh i we have there's all sorts of partners around the us but ah florida gotcha uh we uh we consult with i mean i talk with people all around the world so does doug we might not know the the the conditions in that particular area uh as much as we do up here but they're very similar so the usually what changes is there's a provider that does slightly better there than up here which over there it's usually verizon and at t that's slightly better than uh than t-mobile appear t-mobile has invested a lot in their infrastructure the same process that we go through for determining you know what to recommend uh it's the same whether it's here or there really so it depends on what you're specifically looking for in terms of experience we're happy to chat with you about you know how what you know what solution that might work for you but if it's like about cell providers or specific local conditions um we might end up wanting to connect you with somebody else in that local region i might have there um probably only about a third of my customers are from this area the rest are um all over the the us on both coasts so you know happy to help out there um the other thing just on that power question the another question i get a lot of time is how much power will these consume and so a lot of these routers are rated at sort of the you know 12 to 18 watts of power consumption but i've done some measurements myself and they're typically well under half that in real world use i think pep link's pretty conservative when they do the ratings so certainly not um you know a situation where you're going to drain your batteries by just having your your router active yeah and we're trying to be a little more real world on our data sheets you know previous figures we always just stated the worst case scenario right and that's usually right at boot up right when the router's booting up and the modems are turning on that's usually the highest draw scenario and then it kind of stabilizes to a more kind of nominal or average use case um or dry as it gets you know sorted out and so now we're trying to kind of list both of those figures on on the data sheet so more and more you'll see two figures there and that's that's basically what those two figures are referring to so most of the time it'll be that nominal draw fractions of the time it'll be that that worst case scenario and then if you're really pushing hard on on the data and the poe you might see it kind of somewhere in between but hopefully that helps kind of gauge expectations on that i uh i i flagged two more for us to answer here one was from bob snyder are there any good prepaid cellular plans or is it best to stick with the contract plan my recommendation is actually to use prepaid cellular plans and the reason is they generally will offer those for hot spot or data only plans they'll be fairly inexpensive and they generally don't have as many rules or controls around them when it comes to rate limiting and what have you they'll say you know like right now i have one from t-mobile and one from verizon that are both prepaid cellular plans they're not connected to any other account that i have they're relatively inexpensive and they're between 100 and 150 gigs of uh of 5g connectivity per month so that i have several articles on that and anytime another provider comes out with one of those i usually try to publish a new article because those are the ones that we generally in the industry recommend when you see them jump on them they're they're they're really great and as long as you make sure you pay the bill every month uh they last for a very very long time um the other nice yeah the other nice thing with that is you know i have a prepaid att plan i have a couple of t-mobile prepaid plans um having two different carriers is is a really good idea because as you're cruising you may find some areas are much better with verizon and att becomes kind of the champ for signal strength and then you know t-mobile will take over and having the ability to um you know tune your device to baby be able to connect to the best connection based on different carriers is a really good strategy and to be honest the these plans are getting to the point where they're quite affordable now fifty dollars fifty five dollars uh for for very decent data plans um now with verizon just yesterday announcing they've certified the the br1 pro 5g um you can now activate that device on their network so there's there's lots and lots of options out there but i agree with steve prepaid is it's kind of the way to go you can turn it on turn it off although when you get some of these really good deals it's it's worth hanging on to them because as we've seen for instance with t-mobile they changed the initial 100 gigabyte plan to a 50 gigabyte plan um if you jumped on the 100 gigabyte plan you know your grandfather didn't and i will just throw one note of caution on the prepaid we have just this week we've seen some some customers having issues with at t prepaid plans or cricket wireless which is a wholly owned brand of at t um it's we don't know exactly what the problem is yet some people on these prepaid plans have gotten notices that they have devices that are 3g and they're they're not compliant with the network now and you know these are all lte devices that we're talking about and these are all devices that we've gone through the required steps and changes with att to make sure that they remain compliant and so we don't fully know why some of those people have experienced this problem yet but specifically on this issue we are working directly with att to try and understand if this is a change in policy on what what devices are allowed on prepaid plans or if this is an unintentional mistake that has caused this we just don't know yet but it's not limited to pep link we've seen reports from many other sources out there that other vendors are are also seeing these types of disconnects happen so um you know prepaid prepaid is definitely gonna you're gonna find the best best value there but every now and then it can be kind of a moving target as well as the opinions or uh policies of the carriers change sometimes they're a little bit more restrictive of which devices are allowed and which ones aren't but again this is why we've got people that deal with this every day to understand which ones do work well and which ones which ones don't i would also want to call out chris dunphy is actually attending and i just saw he posted a note here the mobile internet info or mobile internet resource center is one of the best spots that i use even to keep up with things they have more people more time and they track all of the different plans that are available there's a great matrix of that they have a forum and other things you can participate in if you're a member but they're usually one of the first groups out there that start to see problems uh with prepaid plans postpaid plans there's verizon stuff that's getting canceled other things that are that are happening in the industry and they're usually one of the first folks to see that um if you go over to uh it used to be rvmobileinternet.com but you can also go to mobileinternetinfo.com they have articles and updates on all of that as well and it it does appear to be a mistake that they've sent those terminations out but it's still scary and again it comes back to what doug said have multiple plants i have one from every carrier i actually have three from every carrier on purpose because i figure at some point one of them is going to get cancelled and i i need all three carriers so that i can do my job and be out wherever i am so if it's that important to you it's really not that expensive it's just time consuming to keep up with it which is why it's it's good that we have folks out there that can kind of help us with that yeah i don't think i've seen more comprehensive coverage of different data plans specifically for these types of devices than than what mobile internet resource center has on their site definitely just high quality just ground level boots on the ground type of information and you know that's it's just a whole community of people trying to do the the same things stay connected when they're on the move and i'd i'd highly recommend you you get a subscription for their their premier service because they have a lot of content that you can gain access to with the their subscription and i send a lot of customers there who want detailed information on just about anything so yeah they have great guides too like somebody asked a question about a booster and i don't even bother writing anything anymore i just send them to the booster article over there that tells you why you don't want to use that for majority of things and they spent a lot of time simplifying it so that folks who aren't nerds like us that start talking about milliwatt speed you know and all these other different things can understand the technology and i think that's a great a great community for people to to participate in especially if you're just starting or if you're getting into you know spending more money on a peplink router and you really want to understand what's going on it's a great place to start yeah they cover lots of different vendors right like i talk about peplink all day long and i i think we're great but they cover not peplink too and they help just identify kind of what's good for this and what's good for that and what the what the distinctions between them are so you can better kind of understand why the price points may be different or you know just better understand what's what's available in the market so you know i would encourage people to to check out that and you know get that get that perspective there's a bunch of questions i've flagged uh to answer live so there's probably just knock out a few of these real quick what about bonding if the 5g bandwidth is 200 megabits and i use four cellular cards the total bandwidth will be 800 megabits theoretically yes you're never going to get that all the time and if what you're trying to do is get to 800 megabits um i'm wondering what you're doing on your boat but uh the bonding and speed fusion and those sorts of things we talked about that very briefly or we talked about it but we briefly mentioned that it's more about staying connected all the time than it is getting massive download speeds so yes you could get there but really what we're focused on is being connected all the time there's one from jeff about data plans and traveling to canada yeah t-mobile caps on five gigs on some things but they have some plans that are higher than that verizon is the same att is the same the last two years they really dropped the caps really really low as well we're not really sure why but the hard challenge with that is you can't get canadian sims without a canadian address in some situations so you're forced with using wi-fi as when in in local marinas if you're stopping uh or use features uh within the peplink router i did an article a few years ago on controlling your bandwidth shut off things like photo uploads and all the other crazy things that every you know computer uh does you could set metered networks on windows machines and do things and try to eke out you know that that data but ultimately if you aren't a canadian it's harder to get um a full plan from them um so it's a thing jump in and at just a couple of things there as well um one thing uh to think about as well as is google phi they they operate on the t-mobile bands for for data devices um they're not the cheapest game in town but the nice thing with google fi is they have the same data plan no matter which country you're in and so it's it's predictable you can stay connected um used to be they had some uh maximum amount you could pay and then you know was unlimited after that they now have some data caps in place but i've used it in canada without any issue i've used it in indonesia philippines mexico caribbean um and your device just keeps working um no siem swapping or whatever so that's an interesting one to explore the other thing is t-mobile have a business plan um that now includes canada and mexico um for fifty dollars a month and it's a hundred gig for fifty dollars a month so if you need more information on that you can contact me at onboardwireless.com and i can give you more details a couple more here you mentioned speed fusion botting is a key feature yes i think it's critical do you need a license to proper for activating proper web all the routers we talked about today come with speed fusion cloud uh on a trial edition i can't remember what it is i think it varies by device but you don't need to buy speed fusion bonding as a feature it comes with the with the router and then you pay for your usage uh and it's really really reasonable it's much cheaper maybe i shouldn't say this because i don't want travis or peplink to increase the price but it's it's it's very very reasonable um you know it's it's multiple hundreds of gigs for for like 30 or 40 or 50 i can't remember it's on a sliding scale depending on a few different things but it's really really quite inexpensive and the thing to remember with speedfusion cloud is that you can pick what you want to use that so for instance i've picked zoom i've picked office i've picked google work workplace those are the only things that use speed fusion on my boat the random web browsing that i'm doing in the netflix session that someone is running elsewhere aren't going to use that um you can if you want but that's just going to end up using not just more speed fusion cloud data but if you're using two cellular connections you're going to be using double the data potentially there as well so it comes with it and then you can add and remove capacity as well it's pretty easy to use yup and you know we priced it as low as we possibly could on purpose right we want people to use it right we want it to be an attractive solution for people and so i'm not promising it will always be that price but we want it to be in in range for anybody who needs this type of solution right that that's that was really the point of speed fusion cloud you've been able to do speed fusion for years in a kind of do it yourself build your own infrastructure model but most people can't do that most people don't want to do that and so speed fusion cloud is the easy button and and really again we're trying to make it as approachable to people price point and technology wise as possible and i should probably just add that you know speed fusion and in control and warranty and all of that is all included in the price for the first year um in control something we haven't talked about which is another fabulous tool for managing your device when you're away from the boat so for instance on my at home here i can go and look on my boat and see that my routers are working i can shift the priority on the connection that sort of thing so there's a we've really just touched the tip of the iceberg as far as uh some of the capabilities uh of these solutions there was a question from rick um that's actually one that i see a lot which is do these communication devices conflict with systems like time zero for reno radar hot spots that's actually a pretty common uh question and it's not just time zero or for roundo but garmin and raymarine and all of those others those are usually separate on purpose and the chartplotter marine electronics world has kind of gotten stuck in the 1990s when it comes to wi-fi they a lot of them have modernized it but the reason that in particular faruno and some of those don't allow you to have those join other wi-fi networks is because they don't trust those other networks they don't want to have to test that and they aren't going to say yeah sure go ahead and use that and now you're relying on some other third party unit when you're navigating or changing a course or something like that so they don't conflict with them you just need to separate them uh you can run time zero and furuno through switches and through the the the pep link products using technology called vlans and stuff like that but they're not going to be able to piggyback on that wi-fi um unless it's just to do you know chart updates and things like that you can't use them for the actual navigation side of things which is a big question that i get answered or asked a lot about all the other chart plotters as well some of them can but generally keeping them separate is is important for a lot of reasons i might add there that some of the uh ais devices like the vesper products and track products that and amik products that have wi-fi built in they can join an existing boat network in client mode um and that actually is is quite interesting especially with the new vesper cortex you can join it to your peplink network and access that data uh from remote if you've got a vpn to to your home or office and that sort of thing so i i you know on my boat i've got a vesper device connected to my pep link network and that that way i have a single wi-fi network um as steve said many of the chart plotter vendors though don't allow you to go into client mode to join in a a foreign uh wi-fi hotspot so um you know it's really kind of hit or miss but but some of the newer devices out there do allow that uh ability to join a boat network there's a lot of other questions that we're probably not going to be able to answer that are specific about this particular dome or sim injector limitation one of the things that i have always loved i i think i went back and thought about this i think i've used pep link stuff now for like 15 years which is a long time back to when it was just pep wave i think um uh one of the things that's fantastic about the the pep link side of things is the community on the forums uh so while we don't obviously want you to go there and get frustrated by posting basic questions and trying to get support on that there's a wealth of information there about about different things that you could you know go and read as well as uh participate in if you've got a particular feature request somebody asked about one of them that that i'm also interested in the 5g max adapter and the lack of cell phone or cellular information which is something that i know is being worked on there were lots of questions about sim injectors and disabling this that and the other thing the forums are a great place plus you can also you can also contact us directly and we can work through it with you or you can contact support um through your your reseller or through peplink directly too yeah i can't i can't say it enough steve the forum is the right place to continue this conversation because we do watch it we do listen to people it may not appear that way all the time but there are just hundreds of examples i can point to just about any feature on our router and tell you who requested that and who needed that and so those those are things that we watch those are things that we definitely keep track of and you know it may take longer than some people want but we do follow through on these and so i understand there's some there's some kind of drawbacks with the sim injector or some some features that may seem small but are actually kind of a big deal to people we do understand that there's a shortcoming there and so weigh in on the forum right there's other people who've brought these things up and the more people that that mention those things the the faster you're gonna see see those turned around so you know hang in there we do listen and and that's really something that i think is unique about pep link our engineers will get in there and talk to people directly right we don't hide behind the curtain we're we're not ashamed to say we we don't have everything figured out perfectly yet but we're we're always working on these things and again that's where that that long-term firmware support come comes into play and and some of those things too so hang in there and speak up on the forum where there's the other thing is there's just so many real experts on the forum too you'll be just amazed at some of the information and solutions that people will just offer up on there so if you haven't been there register check it out and join the conversation there were a couple of questions as to whether we're going to do this more frequently i know doug and i have talked about doing deeper dives into things like antenna placement and cable length and then i don't know i think i say every other sentence oh i should do a webinar on that so yeah i mean we'd love to hear from you guys what you'd like to see more as well so if there's something in specific you want us to delve deeper into drop us an email post something in the forum get a hold of one of us because we we would rather do this and have it recorded and have multiple people be able to get that information than have to say it every every every day multiple times so and i think one of the things is you know not not there are no two situations that are the same it seems you know every boat situation is unique every workload uh requirement is unique so um well we talked about a couple of solutions here today uh there are literally dozens and dozens of combinations of routers antennas dual routers dual uh you know it um it's definitely worth you know sending us a quick email to to ask about you know what what's a recommended solution for your particular need and or post it on the forum you'll get lots of uh lots of feedback there as well all right folks i can't can't thank you enough we had a ton of people join and there's a ton of people who's hung on here still to the end and so thanks so much for for taking your time and listening to us and thanks again so much to steve and doug for putting all in all the time in preparing for this and helping out with with this this was a a great presentation so thanks to everybody and have a good day travis yeah thanks for having us travis all right bye folks"}

To achieve this, we have developed SpeedFusion technologies which improve your connectivity in multiple ways. Hot Failover enables you to change connections without dropping calls. WAN Smoothing protects your video streaming from packet loss. Bandwidth Overflow dynamically selects connections based on your changing network requirements. Bandwidth Bonding lets you combine multiple cellular links to take your network where it’s never been before. We also make connectivity simpler. SpeedFusion Cloud enables you to use SpeedFusion with just a single endpoint. And you can manage your whole network on a single pane of glass using InControl. Now, it’s time to take Peplink technologies to the next level. Introducing an advanced range of 5G devices from a single 5G WAN to multiple WANs. No matter the criticality,  we have the device to fulfill your application requirements. Let’s take a look. Starting off with a single cellular modem, this BR1 Pro 5G can be found installed in a factory. Its 5G modem along with Wi-Fi 6 capabilities allow for less interference while keeping multiple devices connected simultaneously. This small device can serve as a powerful router in other deployments too. Deploy it for transportation, warehouse management, logistics, or construction, the BR1 Pro 5G is ready to deliver sonic speeds. An option just as reliable is the Balance 310 Fiber 5G. Featuring one 5G modem and an option for a fiber line, this device is deployed at a branch office to maximize both wired and wireless connectivity, utilizing SpeedFusion algorithms. Hot Failover creates a backup connection from fiber to 5G, while Traffic Steering helps prioritize important traffic. This means that crucial VoIP applications are diverted to the 5G connections, while more general internet usage to the fiber line. In the event that you need a second cellular modem, the MBX Mini is the device you’re looking for. This device’s versatility comes to life in this employee shuttle bus. Whether employees are trying to get work done or want to watch on their device after a long day, they are ensured a connection with minimal latency. Using WAN Smoothing, the impacts of packet loss are avoided by filling in connectivity gaps. This allows employees riding the shuttle bus to watch videos smoothly or join calls with no cuts. See this device, this is a HD4 MBX 5G comfortably housed in an ambulance which required a secure and stable connection, real-time responses, low-latency, and high traffic capacity. A device of superior excellence and perfectly matched for any mission-critical applications such as healthcare and teleoperations, this is available in dual or quad 5G modem variants. This scenario uses SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding to provide increased bandwidth and eliminate dead spots, creating a resilient setup. The result is an ultra-stable connection that is not compromised should a single link fail. Match any of our 5G devices with our antennas for a versatile yet effective network setup. These high-tech antennas come default with 5G support, so taking advantage of the extended bands and frequencies is a no-brainer. We make 5G connectivity reliable."}

"hey folks travis here from pep link we've got a bunch of people on the line waiting here that's awesome we've got quite a few people joining so we're going to wait just a couple of minutes before we get the show started but in the meantime we are also broadcasting this live on youtube i've put the link into the zoom chat so if you want to invite somebody else they can just watch via youtube if that's easier there seems to be a little bit of a delay in the audio and video on that but i think that'll be just fine if you're just watching along so yeah we'll just wait just a couple more minutes here and we'll get the show started while we wait just a few more minutes to get started i see one at least one question here we will be recording this the link to the recording will be sent out on our user forum so if you've registered you should get a notice about that but worst case you can go go check the form i think we usually get it up within about 24 hours of the of the webinar so you should see that by tomorrow again we'll sit tight for just one more minute as people start to join and then we'll get started okay folks it looks like we're leveling off here so we're going to get the show started thanks so much for joining i'm travis durrick i'm a product manager here at peplink and today we're here to talk to you about peppling for rv and we've brought a special guest today we've got eric from mobile must-have he is an rver himself and i won't go too far into his introduction but really at peplink we want to make sure that you folks are getting to talk to experts in every every aspect of of applications that that are used for our products and so again we brought eric here to really speak to the ins and outs of how peplink works in the in the rv space thank you so much travis for the great introduction yeah so at pep blink our mission is to make smart unbreakable connectivity anytime anywhere and you know we've got some pictures up here these aren't stock photos these are actually peplink deployments peplink applications so people are doing all kinds of crazy stuff with our products they're using them to enable autonomous driving uh you know we see commercials about you know what the future of 5g might bring but couplings helping bring that today and has been doing that for many years so we've been enabling things like autonomous driving we've been helping folks do things like launching rockets in the middle of the desert again these are real applications but you know you folks are rvers and so what does this have to do with your world and really the beauty of pep link is we've got this powerful technology that enables these really really advanced applications and we've got products that fit into those applications but we also enable that technology on our entire product line so you can get those same really game-changing technologies in any of our products and so you're able to use that same powerful technology to solve problems that really do matter to you that you folks do face day-to-day when when you're trying to stay connected out out and about and so i'll hand it over to eric to kind of kick things off and tell you a little bit about who he is and how he's got into this whole environment yeah thanks so much travis um so my name is eric mccauley i'm the founder of a business called mobilemusthave.com which is a platinum partner with uh with peplink prior to starting mobile must-have i own a couple different companies but probably the the one that i'm most well known for is a company called axiom technology group and we're a managed services provider so we essentially provide its support solutions for businesses and my background as an msp um really sort of led me down the path of starting to work with pep link products and as i started to hit the road which we'll talk about in a minute the pep link solutions that we were using in business lent themselves very well to uh working on the road as well so that sort of business background of i.t support solutions we brought into the consumer market when we started mobile must have to talk about how folks can stay connected while they're on the road my background in terms of the travel perspective up in the top left that's me and my wife kayla our son bradley is 18 months old he didn't make the cut for that photo this was our honeymoon photo but we actually hit the road in that rv that you see to the right of us in that photo back in 2015. um we were you know kind of the new york metro hustle bustle type family working our butts off and and we were fortunate enough because we started axiom back in 2010 to be able to take the plunge to do a remote lifestyle so we're like you know i think we can do this we can actually hop out on the road and at the time we actually weren't married yet uh we were about to get engaged my wife didn't know that yet and i said you know if we can survive in a 400 or less square foot space uh you know what this this could be the one for me and uh the rest is history um with the with kayla and i to the to the right there that's a picture of andy murphy uh and and his wife um they are our digital experts basically they run our website and and manage all things digital and they are also full-time rvers they've been doing it since i believe 2017 if i recall and they actually live and operate in their rv uh via with two children and uh and a dog and a cat they are packed in and uh and they they are a one thousand percent reliant on connectivity to to do their jobs as are we um we're actually connected to you right now via a pep link i'm in my rv right now and this is being streamed through the technology we're going to talk about in uh in this presentation but a high level for folks i think most people know what an rv is but we're basically talking about a house on wheels and since since covid hit there's been an explosion in the rv industry where people have said well you know if i can't be in large groups and i can't interface with a lot of folks maybe i can i can travel and can i do my job from the road and we've seen a huge increase in in the rv industry and that extends beyond just rvs a lot of our customers are also in uh in in boats and in the marine space as well so and and and then obviously commercial as well but for today we're going to kind of talk about how the pep link products can really uh improve connectivity while traveling on the road so um so this slide basically i wanted to distill down what my mission was when i started mobile must have and i started looking at what i felt was was wrong with the solutions that were in the rv space and to be clear there's the the rv industry is catching up to a degree where they're starting to pre-install cellular-based connectivity solutions in their rvs but from a reliability standpoint and from another perspective in terms of just how well it works there are some future challenges for folks that really need unstoppable connectivity and need to be able to work from the road but you know as an rver when i look at what a typical rv customer or person needs from connectivity i say okay first thing kind of going from left to right i want it to be user friendly you know yes i want it to have the technology and the advanced features and functionality for someone like me with a technical background but i want it to also be something that my wife who's not technical knows how to use can operate and can understand if i'm not with her something that's easy i'm looking for something that's reliable that's resilient meaning it can self-heal and it can you know reboot itself essentially or get itself back online if it experiences an issue and something that really i don't have to think about i'm interested when it when it comes to technology and connectivity i look at it like like a utility like lights like water it should just work it's not something that i want to spend my time thinking about that's going to impact my productivity at work and it's you know going to mean that i'm spending a bunch of time playing around with tech instead of going out and enjoying the scenery and and doing the fun stuff which is why we hit the road in the first place i think it's also very important for any solution to be mobile friendly and i know that sounds kind of obvious but when you're in a rv you don't have a lot of the things that you're used to having when you're in a traditional stick and brick type environment probably the single biggest one that i think of is power often times you're not in a situation where you have the ability to be hooked up to a standard ac 120 volt power so for me a system that's providing mobile internet has to also be able to run on vehicle systems and it has to also be able to put up with the environmental challenges of vehicles temperature changes too hot too cold all of those things it needs to be able to operate with and not you know have it impact its ability to perform and and um another thing that's very important i think that's probably our number one question that we get from folks is what's the best sell provider they all ask that they say who should i get for cellular and we kind of laugh at that question because we're like well where are you what time of day is it is it raining how far are you from you know xyz cell tower how many other customers are on that cell tower it's it's just there are so many variables for connectivity that it's impossible to say this is the right cellular provider or carrier and the the way we answer that question is the right provider is more than one provider it's the ability to have a multi-linked connection where you're connected to the internet and you have redundancy and resilience so you can handle a single link going down or a problem occurring and then lastly there's a lot of really cool technology solutions out there that quite frankly there are products that cost more than my rv uh for connectivity so it has to do all of those things and it also has to be something that's affordable for folks so that's kind of like what i think is required for rv connectivity to really check all the boxes for somebody to to feel like they can hit the road and not worry about the internet it sounds like there's a kind of a big checklist of things there and it sounds like all of those things are pretty important when you add it all up it's not just one or the other that's kind of the priority there oh it's and yeah it's there's if you look at any device whether it's an iphone a portable hotspot a you know an integrated solution that came with your rv they're gonna check a bunch of these boxes the challenge is can they check them all and that i was genuinely surprised when i hit the road that i couldn't just go into a camping world or another store that was an rv specific store or my dealership and say hey i gotta work on the road what do you have for me that's gonna just really be next level like something where i don't want a consumer grade product i want something that's going to really work and it's going to give me the connectivity i'm used to from when i was at home and everyone was like yeah that doesn't exist i'm like i that cannot be possible thankfully my brother-in-law is a police officer and when he wasn't looking i started digging around in his police car and i found some coupling products and i said huh so police ambulance first responders these folks need to stay connected it's life or death okay what do these products do that the rv products don't do and is this something that can be brought into the rv space and kind of the rest is history i think at this point this month we just ticked off helping our 30 000 rv customer get connected which is pretty cool since we kind of kicked this all off in 2019. wow that that really is incredible and i i love the origin there i mean just you know like i said at the beginning right we play in a lot of different spaces and we solve problems that are you know just really literally life and death sometimes and it's hard sometimes for people to understand how that can fit into their world too and how that can actually be you know realistic in their world as well it's not just that you know hey yeah i could use that but i could afford it and i could understand how to use it as well so that's really cool um i think you know to meet all of these needs that you've talked about there's several features and capabilities that we've got so i'd like to just kind of have you walk through some of the these features and capabilities and just you know kind of tell tell the folks how this fits into the day-to-day rv life and connectivity in that world yeah absolutely and i mean there's so many more than five but you know we've only got a limited amount of time so i wanted to say okay what are kind of my top five really cool things that that step pep link products you know up and away from from stuff that's available kind of more mainstream in the rv industry the first one is the multiple internet connections um this is a live actual well not live but i took it this morning shot of the pep wave i'm talking to you on right now and if you look there it says priority one highest and you've got five connections to the internet that are all working simultaneously together to help me stay connected on the internet in this particular example that hd1 dome which we'll get into this is a little bit more of an advanced uh setup than just a single pep link product i've got some cool geek slides at the end for folks if they want to you know really geek out and go completely crazy with a setup like this but with the so that dome unit is using t-mobile and then we've got a t and verizon so i've got all three major cellular providers operating at the same time and because i'm currently parked outside of our home i'm also connected to my house internet as well as a secondary backup using uh a technology we'll talk about in a minute called wi-fi is wan or the ability to use like a public wi-fi for your internet source so the pep link product lets me not just pick from one internet or go between them but use them at the same time and that's really a game changer in terms of how the product works for my ability to make sure i stay connected at all times excellent so i think it can be a little bit hard for people to wrap their head around multiple internet connections right i mean they you know with multiple internet connections can come multiple bills but um i think absolutely as people dive into it i think their expectations are really high and you know expectations of any single internet connection are really high right it's just it's supposed to just work right and like you said there's so many variables there and i think that is really what plays out as you try to do this remotely like yeah it works it worked this morning i had a zoom meeting and it was great and then gosh this afternoon i nobody hears me it's breaking up all the time and absolutely yeah and the vast majority of our customers i'd say 99 do not have a setup that is this complicated um i'd say about 75 of our customers utilize a multi-modem solution meaning they do have two modems that are connected at the same time a cellular one and a cellular two and we'll kind of get into the the transit series and the br series products really the transit series products that have those dual modem capabilities at a price point that is digestible for the rv market um and uh but a lot of our customers operate on single modem devices but what's so nice about pep wave is okay i only have one modem but i have multiple sim slots so i can switch between att verizon or t-mobile at the press of a button wait you know 10 15 20 seconds for the modem to reboot and boom i'm on another carrier i'm not sitting there like you know hot spot swapping and i've got multiple wi-fi networks and i'm oh let me try this hotspot and this it's all a single pane of glass single management solution to hop between those things and a lot of our customers like you said because of that cellular connectivity bill they'll operate their primary internet with a high high gigabyte data plan that they've obtained and we can kind of get into that stuff in a bit and then their secondary plan maybe it's a verizon 22 gigabyte plan they'll use that as a backup so it's like you know what i travel primarily with my att for example and then i swap over and i use the verizon only when i have to or when it's simply a better you know coverage area in that area not everyone has to you know use them at the same time it's just that it's a trade-off of can you be down for those 30 seconds when you're swapping modems and a lot of our our customers who are working from the road are saying i really can't like i have to be on the zoom call i can't drop off when i'm presenting to you know 300 people um and and that's uh it's really it's but the key is there is that you have the choices and the flexibility to add or subtract as many connections as you need or want yeah and i think that that 30 seconds that you explained i mean that sounds so trivial when we just talk about it here but when you're on a call and you're waiting for something or something breaks that 30 to 60 to 90 seconds i mean that can be just an eternity in the moment like that and it can you know not only is it frustrating it just doesn't present a very good image when you're trying to you know be professional and and live this kind of mobile lifestyle um but you know there's other products out there that have multiple connections not a lot of them but there are other products on the market that do have the ability to have multiple connections but the thing that peplink does is we make we take a very different approach to that multi-connection strategy there's there's other cellular routers that have one or multiple modems there's other cellular routers that have a wi-fi as lan capability but there's a lot of details and technology in the background that gets kind of glossed over every multi-modem or a multi-connection product is very much not the same and so that leads me into what is our second feature or capability here that really i think makes peplink stand out from all those other solutions and that's our speedfusion technology and speedfusion cloud so if you can just kind of help explain what that is and how you've been using that or how your customers have been using that yeah absolutely so um i guess to put it kind of simply so if you had five internet connections imagine you have like five cell phones sitting on a table in front of you and you want to make a phone call the fact that you have five cell phones in front of you does not mean you're going to have a more reliable phone conversation you have to pick up one phone and make the call and the way the internet and networking operates um in its kind of native or standard configuration is is a lot like a phone call there is one connection that you can use to to talk back and forth with another computer somewhere else on on the internet um what what speed fusion does or you know it's also known as like sd-wan or bonding is that it it essentially takes a a vpn technology on the pep wave and it connects to a data center in in the case of speed fusion cloud it's connecting to pepwave's data center and it's creating a tunnel that allows all five of those connections to flow through that tunnel at the same time and on both sides of that tunnel there is either hardware or software typically a pep wave like you see in this picture that is essentially kind of organizing all of the data and information to go across all five of those connections at the same time and with speed fusion cloud you can do a lot of really cool things like hey you know what i want to actually send a little bit i want to send copies of data across two different connections so if one of the connections fails there's a second backup copy of that information or data that's going over the second connection the the term typically used for that is called when smoothing and when you enable wind smoothing which is a simple check box in speed fusion you're you're now not only using multiple connections but you're creating redundancy in that connection so that you can connect to to that carrier in multiple with multiple connections in terms of speed fusion um cloud what's so cool about i mean sd-wan has been around for for a while but it used to just be like no problem just pick up your thirty thousand dollar router and it'll it'll support that function uh you're being literal there right that's not a that's not a made up price point either i know it's a very very literal i'm like you know oh and by the way you need two of them because you got to buy one for the other side so now you're they're like 60 grand i'm like yeah and then you have to pay the monthly bill for the internet pipe um so it it and you need multiple pipes so it it used to be we did a lot of sd-wan for hedge funds private equity firms financial services banks stuff like that where they really could could afford that um they also needed to pay me so you needed an i.t guy typically with an extensive you know networking background to set the thing up it's oftentimes like command line and it was just you know you you kind of needed a pretty heavy tech stack to get the stuff working um what what speed fusion cloud does and it's quite amazing um and i know i'm a pep link partner but i use this and it's pretty cool is it lets you set up sd-wan without needing to subscribe to anything for a data center and you can do you can get from i'm online to enabling speed fusion in less than five minutes and you need absolutely no technical background if you look in the top left those are literally the four steps from the actual management console of how you set up speedfusion cloud step one you choose your cloud location which most people just set to auto so it'll automatically connect to the data center closest to you and typically step two which is the only thing you need to do is the third button there that says link wi-fi to cloud you press that and it will just duplicate your wireless network and at you know you can rename it to say speed fusion or whatever and creates a new wireless network on your pep wave that instantly now is going to use the speedfusion technology and what's great about that is you can then connect only the devices that you want to use speedfusion to that connection so that you don't have to route all of your traffic through speed fusion um some people ask me they're like why don't i just route all my traffic through speed fusion and you can i typically do but you know there is a fee associated with how much traffic you're running through that pipe and also when you're rving if if you do like a google search for local chinese restaurant it's going to show you the restaurants that are at the data center location in chicago so a lot of the times you don't want to necessarily use speed fusion for everything but for a zoom call or for something where you need that unbreakable connectivity it's something where you can just simply change the wi-fi network you're connected to and boom you're connected and you're using multiple connections and that's just something i have not seen uh from from anyone except for public i think it's a really revolutionary product that brought something complicated down to you know folks that that don't have to have you know i.t degrees so i love the the five cell phone analogy because you know we've tried to try and boil this down to make it easy to understand for folks what what we're really enabling or delivering with speed fusion here and i think that really does a great job of explaining that like he said you know if you're in your car and i'm on a verizon phone and i've got an att and a t-mobile phone sitting next to me yeah my call is only on verizon i've got these two other phones next to me but you know i go into this little dip or this little valley and maybe verizon's not covering that as well as t-mobile is you know every every network's gonna have little differences here and there right i'm not trying to pick on any one network but that's the reality right if you travel hundreds of thousands of miles nobody's the best in any one spot like you said um but you know with speed fusion you can literally hand that call off from at t to verizon and so it works exactly the same on like you said with these internet applications if i open up a zoom call and i have another vendor's router that has two different cellular connections in it their router is only going to be able to send that zoom call out one connection or the other now if your kid's watching youtube maybe the youtube feed goes out the other connection but your con your zoom call is still going to live and die on that one single connection and so speed fusion is what makes that completely dynamic and able to shift midstream mid packets so that you can completely hand that call off without that 30 90 second drop you know if you're using a corporate office vpn on your laptop it's the same thing that vpn can only live on one connection or the other connection with with a non-sd-wan device and i think the term sd-wan gets um abused a little bit there's the sd-wan that you talked about right there's the enterprise-grade sd-wan and that's been around for a long time and that can do some of the things that we've just been talking about right shifting things live from one to another but in the cellular space vendors throw that term out a lot in a very misleading way to make you think that their multi-radio solution is going to deliver that and a lot of people just end up disappointed when they actually go through that failover experience because with other multicellular routers they don't have that real packet level sd-wan technology and so when that when that when that single line fails so do your calls and it's just kind of unexpected for people when they thought they had redundancy they thought they had access to these multiple networks and so it might be splitting hairs on a technical perspective but you know the day-to-day experience it's a major difference yeah i mean we we see a lot of folks uh confuse also load balancing with with bonding so it's like non-bonded i'm like well no you have two connections enabled but what's what's really happening is some of your traffic's going out this connection and some of your traffic's going out this connection and the pep wave supports that natively if you don't enable speed fusion and you have a multi-modem device but quite a few competitors and some stuff in the rv space sort of i wouldn't say they market it directly but they sort of they sort of say like oh this is a bonding device and i'm like well it's really not your connection's using one or the other um and yes you do have the ability to have more bandwidth across two but it's it's not it's not technically you know utilizing any redundancy and and kind of i know we're diving a little bit for the weeds but i'm just so excited about some of the questions i'm seeing in chat and what people are doing um one thing to just note is when you enable something like wand smoothing you are typically utilizing more data so if your you know zoom call was going to use you know i don't know 200 megabytes for a call it would actually if you had wan smoothing enabled at its sort of standard mode it would use about double that so it would use 400 meg because it's duplicating so many packets but you can also which i love in the latest version of speedfusion cloud is you can actually disable lan smoothing i'm on this call right now and i i don't i don't typically actually enable land smoothing unless i'm in a really tough tricky area it's worked out really well where i just have speed fusion enabled without that but just the customization that you can do to to kind of balance how much data you're using with uh how reliable your connection is is is just it's just awesome and and the fact that you you don't need a second device so you're effectively connecting to the speedfusion cloud which is can it's acting like a second device up in the cloud but you don't have to purchase something and then go put it somewhere where there's an internet connection so if we've got all these multiple connections it just sounds complicated right there's just so many things in play and you know just how how do i make sense of all this right as a non-technical user yeah i mean so i think one of our most common things we see when we bump into a customer who says i i don't know i sort of work some i've got all these hot spots i use my phone i've got three carriers which it's kind of the funniest thing because they're already paying typically for more than one cellular provider but they went you know into a store and they picked up a hotspot and a lot of those hot spots you know or all of those hot spots really were not designed to be on 24 7. that's not what they do they're designed to be taken out of a backpack used for three four hours have five or six devices connect to them and then turn them off and that's sort of how they are supposed to operate but um regardless of that one of the challenges when you start to have all of these different hot spots is they're all broadcasting their own wi-fi networks so it's like you turn on the verizon hotspot okay let me go into my smart tv let me go into my laptop let me go into my amazon echo let me go into all my stuff and go connect it to the new wi-fi oh i move locations verizon doesn't work i'm gonna hop over to my att you're like hopping back into that tv and i don't know about you but if i have to type a wi-fi password with my tv remote i'm like i wanna i'm not very happy after i do it two or three times i'm like this is crazy um what the pep link device does is it says hey regardless of what internet connection you're using your internal network your private wi-fi network is going to always stay the same so you know in my case my network i call it enterprise because we called our rv enterprise so my local wi-fi that broadcasts inside my rv says enterprise and regardless of where i'm switching from an internet connection perspective my local wi-fi and all my devices don't have to be reconfigured that also applies to my desktop which i'm talking to on right now which has a ethernet hardwire to the pep wave so i've chosen to run an ethernet cable so i'm not even using wi-fi for my desktop to just make it a little bit more reliable because wi-fi is typically very reliable but you know there can be a lot of interference in certain rv parks and um also i just i'd rather be hardwired so that the wi-fi is available for other devices in in my network so you can have a private wi-fi you can then wire in hardwired devices um you know we hardwired in our tvs and other stuff and we've also hardwired in our our rv management system that controls climate and all that stuff and we'll get into that in a little bit but then you have the ability to also group your networks so what that means we see this a lot for customers is they want a network for their kids and they're like hey can we just have a kids network they want a network for work like hey can you create a network on the pep wave device that's um that's something where i can then set like bandwidth limits and this will have a priority of usage over the connection absolutely you can um we'll get into it a little bit more in a bit but you can also do things like content filtering and parents for parents that's huge it's like hey i need i want to block youtube okay we can do that all you know inside of the pep link ecosystem you're able to do that and then lastly you can set up a guest wi-fi for when you have folks coming in you're not handing out the wi-fi password to your private network where people would be able to see your devices on the network you can give them an isolated guest network and you can also set bandwidth limits for that network to say that one you know maybe doesn't have access to as much of your bandwidth or availability through through the management interface so that local kind of unified i just set up my devices once i hate to sound like you know ron popeil from you know the old infomercial days but you set it and you forget it you know that's kind of how it works yeah that's i mean that's really important because it's something we've seen in a lot of different you know customer profiles where you know they've already came to the point where they understand okay yes i do need more than one connection but you know again it's that ease of use thing and you know you can like you said you can just set it all up and you can forget it you can say okay yeah my you know the these wi-fi networks are you know free number one generally and so you know let's use that bandwidth first and you know for these applications i really prioritize those those are you know mission critical for me that all happens no matter which connections you're on no matter which rv park you're at it right it just stays there and it automatically manages what's available what's priority one what's priority two and so you have to go back in there and fine tune things every time you get to this place or that place it's all just kind of baked into the cake yeah i mean i we kind of deleted the slide just because it was getting a little technical but um i it does look like we've got quite a few pep link users in in chat and they're asking questions about you know hey can i prioritize a a less expensive connection and the the answer is absolutely on the dashboard you can say priority one two three and set your priorities based on what you want to have uh operate first you can then set bandwidth caps and limits per sim hey if this sim hits this many gigs turn it off and then it will automatically fail over to the second rule and then if you want to get even more kind of fun you can hop into the advanced tab and go into the outbound policy section and then you can really get deep into doing some cool stuff like hey i want to do a weighted balance where 60 of my traffic goes over this link and only 40 goes into this link and you can start to really dial in how your links are used based on um you know whatever factors you're trying to to account for data plans usage uh speed on each line et cetera i mean i'm not sure off top my head i think you guys have like seven or eight algorithms for how to route outbound traffic um you can do it by lowest latency by what you know connection responds the fastest uh you can do it by like i said weighted balance you could do enforced you know saying hey i always want to use this connection for i don't online banking because i want to you can do whatever you really want with outbound policies and dial it into a to just such a perfect degree of i've yet to find something i can't do with this device i'm probably going to probably going to regret saying that when the q a session comes up but at least for for my use it's it's just been incredibly flexible i don't have to say we can't do that very often i can't think of an example off offhand where we just can't do that right it's it's you know it's we've got an amazing engineering team that enables all of these capabilities so it's it's fun to be able to jump into these different challenges um so wi-fi is wan isn't unique to pep link but if you could just explain number one what that is and then number two you know how we can take that a step further with our solution yeah so i mean wi-fi as wan essentially means hey connect to an external public wi-fi source typically it could also be a private wi-fi source like at your home or somewhere else but for the vast majority of of rv customers or or boating customers it's going to be a marina wi-fi system or a campground wi-fi system and historically they have not been particularly very good uh i'll just be perfectly honest uh it's you know been one of those things where you connect and you're just like oh this is this is not uh not really that much fun now with with broadband becoming more available in rural areas and becoming more uh affordable we're starting to see campgrounds that you know are getting you know gigabit ethernet connections and porting it into their wi-fi systems so it's starting to we were at a campground uh about six months ago in the smoky mountains and they had gigabit ethernet at every single pedestal um and then they also had it through the wi-fi was the fastest wi-fi i've ever seen um in a campground it was really kind of mind-blowing that they'd figured out how to get it to work so well it's not necessarily what we would consider like a primary thing you want to do is use wi-fi because it has limited range and and it uh it typically in a campground is pretty saturated but it's available and it's something that you could do and you can add it as an additional layer inside of the speedfusion cloud tunnel but great so wi-fi wan you can use public wi-fi and again you've got that single local ethernet so if you decide to connect to campground wi-fi you're not taking all of your devices in your rv and connecting them to the campground wi-fi another kind of benefit not that i want to encourage folks to break the rules but your pep wave is considered one device so if you're at a campground and they charge 49 for use of premium internet wi-fi for up to three devices when your pep wave connects to that wi-fi as one device all of your other devices in your rv are going to operate as that same one device because they're behind the pep wave so you kind of get outside of that limit of oh i'm only allowed to have you know one or two devices now everything is connected as long as your pep way is connected a big question that we get around wi-fi when is is it secure and that's a great question i mean we can have local security and we can do all sorts of stuff but at the end of the day if if you're just using a standard wi-fi wan product you're going over that campground's wi-fi and you're subject to whatever is going on in their connection your traffic's essentially not encrypted at that point even though the wi-fi is encrypted at the you know router level there could be something going on that could be looking at your information is it likely no but can it happen yes and when you add in that speedfusion or speedfusion cloud component you're putting that vpn tunnel over that wi-fi connection through that campground wi-fi so that is securing it um so it is it is a way to secure the ability to use a public wi-fi system without having to go buy a third-party vpn software like nordvpn or or or one of those which are also options you can do um the challenge is just they typically run on one device so it's you know when you're using speedfusion cloud anything that's connected is going to run through that secure connection nice yeah i love that because that's you know that extra layer of security is something that i think is easy to overlook but like you said it you don't know who may be on the other side of that right it may be an encrypted network over the air but that doesn't mean it's encrypted over the wire when it you know when it gets into that network and so yeah that's just one more line of defense you've got to kind of keep that it's not exactly and it's not always malicious i mean at the end of the day you know your your internet service provider is selling information about your your ability to use the internet and that's perfectly legal and they're making money on that and if that's something you want to avoid then you know securing your wi-fi and having it run through speed fusion cloud is is definitely a a great way to do that yep absolutely so if we've got all these connections and all these applications and all these user groups how are we gonna like put this all together what do you what tools do we have there to like make sense of all this yeah i was like how much stuff can i fit on one slot apologies for the uh the dense packed slide here um but um i'd say the first thing that we we get um that really just stands out from any real routing product is the ability to have just extensive reporting and usage reporting i mean you can dive into reporting on what protocols are using the internet but you know just keeping it high level the ability to look at bandwidth reporting downloading and uploading real time by connection or by day or by month and and see that metered usage and understand your usage characteristics and understand what's going on is huge for the mobile community um the ability to i mean i can't tell you how many people hit the road they're brand new to rving and you know they go through 150 gigs in in three days they're like what do you mean i'm throttled and i'm like well i'm looking at the usage reports and uh yeah it looks like were you guys watching netflix and they're like yeah my kid you know i just put the tv on so that and i'm like yes so that was at 4k and uh yeah that was about 20 gigs per movie so so how many did you watch and they're like five i'm like well there you go um so so the ability to see the reporting um and to see it live in real time we see a lot of customers hey my internet's slow i'm like cool click on the status tab click on clients and they're like okay and i'm like sort by download speed or upload speed and they're like yeah something here says 10 megabits and i'm like cool what's the name next to it they're like macbook and i'm like uh-huh i'm like are you using that macbook they're like no and i'm like cool it's downloading updates and they're like oh it is i'm like yeah you should probably turn that off because you're burning your cellular data plan because your macbook's downloading uh you know mojave or whatever the latest operating system is that's four four gigabytes or six gigabytes um so it's you know is the cellular network perfect is it always fast aren't there you know external considerations and whatnot absolutely but the reporting and the visibility is a huge component to understanding why the connection is slow and figuring out what you can do about it um then you've got your your ability to set limits so you can say you know what i want to set up groups and i want to set up bandwidth limits by device or by groups um you can also you know you can use a sliding scale for bandwidth like i want 60 of my bandwidth to be for devices in this group like my work computers and i'll reserve the rest for other devices or for my guest network um you can also like for me i i set up application priority um i did a little screenshot there of you know zoom voiceover ip and my application zoom if i hit save on that screen i can then tell it do i want it to be low priority high priority medium priority so we typically set our streaming services as high priority and then we set i'm sorry our voip services high priority and then our streaming services as normal or low priority because we don't want the stream to be a priority over the call it's not saying that it's going to stop netflix but it will all often times reduce the amount of bandwidth that netflix has available in favor of zoom and that's a that's a pretty cool feature and then lastly here we've got the content filter um screenshot here and apologize for the the p word there but that is what it is so you have the ability to block adult content and and stuff like that that uh you may not want folks to have access to on your network yeah and you can you can customize that per group like you talked about too so you can have a kids group that blocks all that and not that you necessarily want to open it up for yourself but you've got the ability to distinguish between those two groups and what they may or may not be able to see and so it's just one more layer of customization that you can kind of put into play and again not have to manage day-to-day absolutely and if you if you want to go with a more robust content filtering solution um that you know uses different dns servers you can do that as well so it's like it you know the built-in product is i think exceptional based on the fact that it's that it's it's free you know it's included in your your care subscriptions so you know the fact that you can use that um is great but if you want to step it up and use something a bit more advanced you have that ability as well you know it's like any other router it's fully configurable to to use whatever content service you want to you want to use so we've talked about a lot of different features a lot of different capabilities and so i i want to just go back and kind of like put it all back together now right i think this this piece you put together really connects all the dots for people from where we started here yeah so this is a graphic courtesy of uh chris and cherie from the mobile internet resource center uh which is a a fully member-funded uh unbiased news and information site that's located at rvmobileinternet.com we partner with them for quite a quite a bunch of stuff really around product information we send them you know hardware to test and they do independent analysis on those products they're not paid by us or or anything like that or paid by anyone for that matter other than their members so it's a member funded community and one of the the things that they do not to you know give them a shameless plug but it's just so awesome when i'm talking to customers is they put together sample gear guides or gear setups and this is a an example of one of those that utilizes a peplink mobile router and kind of gives you a visual interpretation of what's going on with that setup so kind of taking it from let's go the opposite direction we'll go top right around uh to the left we've got that multi-wan configuration so you you see your two cell towers there and your wi-fi connection and those are all connecting to a centralized central antenna or roof antenna and we'll get into some of the the pep link products that that you guys feature i think specifically for the rv industry we'd be looking at the mobility 42g which is a seven and one antenna that has four cellular elements two wi-fi elements elements like antennas basically and then one gps element all in that single you know nice compact i think it's about eight and a half inch wide dome and that allows you to connect two multiple cell carriers um using like a category 6 or category 12 modem we'll get into that and wi-fi all from that uh that roof antenna and a lot of people are like oh the campground wi-fi is terrible i'm like where are you they're like i'm in my rv i'm like so the wi-fi is not good inside of the aluminum box that you live in and they're like yeah i'm like oh i'm not surprised like you what happens if you go outside oh it's great outside so by removing the the devices from basically by putting the antenna up on the roof you're greatly improving your cell signal by using an external antenna and uh you also can pick up wi-fi wind much easier so kind of looking down going into the unified network so now you've picked up those multiple wands that device in the middle there is your pep wave and that's now rebroadcasting to your internal devices it is a mobile friendly solution all pep link devices that we talk about today will run on dc power typically between like 10 and 30 volts so if you've got a 24 volt system you're you're covered um some of the more advanced modems like the transits will run on 48 volts so if if you're running like a solar system or a 48 volt battery bank and you want to power it at that voltage you can um so it's a highly mobile friendly device and it and it's very and it operates at a variety of different voltages so it's it's like if it's you know 11 volts or 12 volts or 13.8 volts you're not in a situation where that modem is rebooting or having problems um which we we just love the power system that you put in that device uh some of our previous solutions would would just quite frankly reboot whenever the batteries got a little low and people would get really frustrated with us and we're glad we're we're away from that and onto pep link um and then yeah everything we talked about before so it's resilient and reliable i mean we're talking about an enterprise grade product i mean if you run you know let's see i mean travis you know if you run a sdx or really you know some of our enterprise grade pep link products or you run a transit you log into them same software running on both so you're getting all of that development from you know a 30 plus thousand dollar router that's designed to basically be in a data center or for a carrier and the the amount of of software development and reliability that went into that piece of software is running on the device that you can buy for your rv and that's why i think it worked so well um and then yeah speed fusion and user friendly it's uh stuff we've covered there yeah that's something that i'm personally really proud of just the fact that you can have a solution from pep link that costs 30 000 that runs a literally runs an entire you know hospital campus and you can get that same technology in a 300 product from peplink i mean it's just you just don't see that very often and so i just i'm really proud that we're able to bring that capability down to folks you know to make it useful for them because again everybody needs connectivity now it's not just the uh the hedge funds and the fortune 500s of the company of the of the world that need that connectivity now it's it's really an everybody type of type of need at this point so um yeah i mean i i don't know we'll geek out for a second but i don't know if you remember the the the wi-fi vulnerability that i think was like back in 2017 it was called crack and basically they found a a pretty blatant vulnerability in wi-fi networks where you could you could crack into a wi-fi network peplink patched that before cisco did and that was tough because i'm a cisco partner as well and my customers were like it was great to get on the phone with with meraki and cisco and be like oh well peppering patched this already why haven't you guys patched it already and because of that unified operating system that meant that it was able to be patched across the entire you know platform of systems within i want to say it was like within six or seven days from that vulnerability being identified it was really cool and you know that unified software kind of idea it's like out of the apple playbook you know if you look at you know your iphone and your ipad they're all running the same software and i think it was super smart for peplink to do that because it's it's just creating a tremendous amount of reliability in the products yeah you know again i get to kind of stand on the shoulders of giants you know those are decisions that our engineering team made years and years ago to try and you know really make their life simpler but also again like you said enable that common experience across the products and so it's something that we're you know very focused on maintaining that that common experience right you know this product may have more radios or more this or faster that but um yeah that that kind of standardized development process where you know if it's if it's capable of being run on the different hardware platforms you're going to be able to be able to do that and you know again like the security patches and things like that it just benefits you know there's benefits beyond just uh what features or functionalities you're able to get um the next one you and i kind of geeked out on yesterday but i think this is really interesting because you know it's not just about connecting to the internet it's uh you know for folks that have a say a more sophisticated setup or just a larger setup there's a lot of cool things you can do besides just you know getting on your zoom call when you're out in a national park yeah so this is this is a snapshot of my my previous rv actually sold this rv and i i continued to monitor it for the customer who who purchased it because they're like can you just keep an eye on the rv i'm like sure so because they have a pepling solution in the in their rvv we were able to uplink the uh the management systems this one's run by a company called victron that's pretty pretty well known in the marine space and it's starting to become more and more well known in the rv space so we have complete visibility over the power systems of this particular rv so solar you know what ac loads how what's going on with shore power our battery weather uh input current everything going on there um for i didn't have time to take a snapshot but for our rv we're in right now which is made by a company called integra they have a system called a firefly system which is a touch screen that manages kind of everything in the rv from the slides to the hot water to the window shades to climate control to lights everything and that is an ip enabled device so we spent a few minutes on the phone with firefly got the the configuration for their network removed the uh router that they pre-installed with the coach that was with a consumer-grade device put our pep link in and now we can control and see everything in the rv from our phones or tablets either when we're in the rv or when we're anywhere out and about to keep an eye on our on our rv and that's not just you know for the high-end class a's anymore we're seeing uh you know lippert is a is a pretty well-known manufacturer and and we work with them on some some cool stuff and ideas and they uh their oneconnect product um we've integrated multiple times and a lot of our customers have where that you know even down to like you know entry-level rvs have the ability now to to have these central management consoles and they can be network controlled or at least accessed via a pep link with with typically just with a single ethernet cable yeah that's very cool um so we're running into we got about five minutes left on the scheduled time here we've got a lot of products to show you folks and i'm going to go through those really quickly because i want to respect your guys's time and uh i think eric if if you're okay we'll take just the last four minutes to click through those quick and then if you can stay on we can take a few questions for folks and just give folks a few opportunities to get some other details sorted out that they're interested in absolutely sorry i i i talk so much no this is actually mine yeah same here i mean i i can talk about this stuff all day and i hope the folks on the line are are finding finding value in this as well but um but yeah so like we've talked about you know we've got a really wide range of products to serve all kinds of different needs but you know looking into the rv world there's a handful of models that i think really fit well depending on who you are how important connectivity is for you and you know where you're going what you're trying to do and so there's some really affordable entry-level options and then there's some more advanced performance options and then there's a whole line of accessories like antennas because you know these connections are only as good as the weakest link in that in that path and so we'll step through these quick here you know the transit mini this is a 399 device right very affordable very small but still super rugged it's got some of these capabilities we talked about it's only got one cellular connection in it um but it's got two sim cards so if you show up at this national park in this state and att is best here cool you can use at t if you show up at a different park in a different state and verizon's the best there cool you can switch to that sim card you can only use one at a time but again you can have those in there and you can kind of automate which one you prefer to use but you can also do the wi-fi wan you can also plug it into an ethernet connection if that park has that type of connectivity so you can still get some of those speed fusion cloud benefits bridging the gap between your cellular connection and either that wi-fi lan or your your ethernet connection if you happen to have that um we've got the br1 mark ii this is very similar in in terms of the connections it supports the the big difference here is it's just got way better wi-fi it's got a dual band mimo configuration versus the single band single antenna configuration on the previous one so it's going to perform better on the wi-fi as well and it's going to perform better for all of your devices that are connecting to it over wi-fi the transit pro e this is a new model in our transit series this is a dual cellular device and so it's got again the ability to connect to two networks at the same time so you can do those more advanced things like land smoothing bonding over multiple cellular connections at the same time so just a little more capability on the cellular side it's got that great but for folks that's the device that i had all the screenshots on that's the device we run in our coach oh cool yeah this one you know it's got again that same great wi-fi experience and just some other like you talked about earlier that wider uh voltage input so it accommodates different different power scenarios uh it's also got poe output so if you've got an ip phone cool that's one less thing that you have to find a plug-in for or an ip camera or something like that or just a wi-fi access point yeah what we've been doing just i know we're going to go quick but we we uh use the roof antenna and the integrated radio for wi-fi only then we disable it for local wi-fi and then we use that poe port to power an ap uh ax light for internal wi-fi in the coach and it's powered via that poe port it works really well for us yeah and that's i i think that's a good little detail to touch on i mean when you start sharing functions of one radio there's trade-offs there right so if you've got one device and it's doing your wi-fi when and it's connecting all your devices in in your rv there's going to you know there's practical limits that you're going to hit and so depending on how many devices how fast you're trying to run uh separating those two functions may be maybe something of of usefulness for for folks that are trying to just just have a little more power user profile maybe now moving up to the latest and greatest we've got the br1 pro 5g this is a like it says a 5g device so it'll connect to to all the major networks over 5g it's just wrapping up verizon certification right now but it is already certified on atnt t-mobile and it is very much verizon capable so it'll be official on there hopefully before the end of the year but if not shortly into the next year but this is really the state-of-the-art device it's got wi-fi six again it's got that 5g it'll also fall back to 4g so it's a category 20 device on a 4g network so still above that gigabit lte threshold so still very very fast on the 4g networks as well so it's a good future proof right if you don't have 5g coverage where you're going today no problem it's going to be as fast as possible on 4g and then when that carrier has the 5g coverage there it's going to be ready for that as well yeah in testing again with uh with our friends at the mobile internet resource center we were getting 400 and 400 plus megabit download speeds on t-mobile with this device so not only is it you know incredibly capable from a modem perspective but the processor and the memory and sort of the the router throughput back end on that thing is is very impressive it's definitely a step up from previous generations and and uh we're excited for the for the cellular networks to catch up to that thing because uh you know they're not all quite there yet but uh fact that we can fail over to 4g and uh and and use those networks when needed uh definitely helps out and it's a very good future-proof device it turns out it's hard to get 5g coverage out to all the nooks and crannies of the country right it's uh it's gonna take some time for them to get that coverage rolled out and uh so it'll help you yeah yeah we're work you know some of the larger carriers we see we hop on 5g and it's slower than 4g we're like no but you know it's it's getting better and uh i i personally think t-mobile's leading the pack with with download speeds right now on 5g um but the fact that you just have the ability to to to be on either network really is is is great for someone who's looking for the fastest possible speeds but it is a single modem device and people always like well how come you don't have dual 5g and that is that is something available for because i know that question comes up a lot but keep in mind with 5g you need four cellular antennas so a dual 5g would have eight antenna leads up on the roof uh and they don't typically make a single dome for that yet so you're getting into um significantly higher price points and uh and a lot a big fat bundle of wires to the roof so it's it's not quite uh feasible i would say for the rv space at this point but um but it you know single 5g is a really great option with plenty of speed yep absolutely so we've got a whole lineup of antennas and these so these are antennas that we've designed and manufactured in-house these are not something that we're white labeling these are things that we've spent a lot of time and thought on you know number one the performance number two the price point and then number three just the installation experience and so this line of antennas is something that i'm really proud of and excited about because it's uh it's a fairly new offering for us i think we've had them a little over a year right now but a lot of these models are very recently introduced and so we're just growing this antenna portfolio so i'm not going to spend time going through each one of these antennas you can go to to mobilemustave.com or peplink.com to check these individual models out but there's just different configurations for different uh different numbers of connections so depending on the device you've got one or the other may be a better fit or one or the other might be a better fit just if you've got growth plans or expansion plans down the road you might want to just buy something with more connections ready because these are 5g ready they've got all the frequency support for 600 megahertz to 6 000 megahertz so it's going to cover all the way up through that new c-band spectrum that a lot of the carriers are just getting ready to roll out next year so this again is just ready for for a lot of the things to come on the 5g side but again we've got lots of different form factors for different use cases so there's a lot to choose from here eric let you talk about the some of these youtube resources that are out there for folks yeah so uh this is i've said it a few times we just we really love partnering with the mobile internet resource center they they you know have just been such a great partner to to get plain english explanations of the variety of products that are out there that kind of in that lower picture you see chris there with the entire lineup of kind of pep link products and the evolution of how they've come you know full circle over the years uh chris and sheree they they travel with pep link products their go-to products the transit duo which um is is the transit duo and the transit pro ear are fairly interchangeable other than a few extra lan ports um and you know they have access to all of it and this is what they um you know travel with but it really is a resource i mean not to say you know we don't want folks to buy peplank but they cover everything and it's not all pep link um so for some folks it's hey we just need a uh what's the best data plans that are out there that's the place we point all of our customers to if you want to know the latest and greatest how to get the highest gigabyte plans what's going on in data these are the folks if you um you know hey i just need a tablet to connect to the internet they really have just about everything that you could possibly think of um they're they're really kind of the industry leaders for for covering all all things mobile internet so i definitely recommend folks check them out and about i don't know i want to say 60 plus percent of the content is 100 free um you can kind of check out the overviews see what you know what modems are are are looking good and if you really want if you want to dive into more advanced stuff or look at those you know example configurations or hop into we run a forum actually in the mobile internet resource center where our customers can come to us and ask us more advanced configuration stuff like speedfusion for example so that would be when we'd say you know take a look at possibly joining the mobile internet resource center i think it's pretty uh pretty awesome and and not a huge you know investment for folks and members also get a pretty hefty discount at mobilemosthave.com that usually pays for the membership yeah i'm just really impressed with them because you know they're really focused on the users right they're not aligned with a vendor or you know it's it's really the user first and they bring a lot of integrity to the content that they're presenting out there it's not something that we're talking to them in the background and saying hey you should say this about this thing or it's purely their perspective and they're looking at it from the user's perspective and so again they're just a really unbiased and really trustworthy worthy site from everything that i've seen from them so very highly recommended yeah and this is a youtube channel called changing lanes um they've got over 200 000 subscribers really well known in the rv space there's a link down below where uh chad and tara um talk about their transit duo installation and they do a couple different kind of fun and cool things they have a roof antenna installed on their vehicle but then they also play around with some directional antennas and start to kind of show you what you can do with some pole mounting directional to improve speeds um and these guys they go they're north of a terabyte a month of data usage so they are power power users and it's kind of fun to watch uh them explain how they stay connected on the road and do what they need to do with public products yeah very cool very cool content over there i've enjoyed some of their videos as well so let's we've been geeky but let's let's get really geeky now let's show them what you guys have set up on in your environment yes so uh unfortunately the the mobility 42g wasn't out yet when we when we built this so there is a another seven in one roof antenna on the top right but but you know replace that with a 42g um but essentially what we have here i'll kind of start in the top left this is our setup in our our rig so we have a transit pro e there that is uh that is linked up um to that roof antenna that's on the picture in the top right um then that is a seven in one antenna so we have our wi-fi and our four cellular and our gps transmitting from the roof if you're wondering why the antennas are sitting on those plastic boxes it's because our rv has uh metal rails along the side which is our awning and we want to raise our antennas above those rails for maximum cellular performance um taking it kind of a geeky next step we took a what's called an hd1 dome which is a category 18 very fast roof mountable pep wave device basically another modem it's a it's got its antennas integrated into that dome that you see on the top right all the way kind of towards the front of the vehicle and we've run that down into a sim injector which you see on the left there that says pep xm on that and that gives us eight sim cards that we can remotely inject into that hd1 dome so we can switch between any carrier we've got we're testing this basically our test unit so when we're testing data plans or other stuff i can you know switch between eight different sim cards plus the transit has another four sim slot so i have a total of 12 sim card slots uh that we're operating and uh the hd1 dome plugs into the wan port of the transit pro e so that i get that single pane of glass management of all of these devices in uh in on one page um getting outside of peppling for a second if you look at the bottom left i have a 56 volt dc converter that's taking 12 volt power from my rv and it's up converting it to 56 volts that's i think a 39 dollar converter that we sell at mobile must have and that then puts 56 volts into the transit pro e which then enables that poe output and from there i don't have the picture here because i ran out of slide space but that then powers our apax light which is behind our tv so i don't even know how i'd get a picture of it but um that is our our total solution so uh basically what this gives us is the ability to have three cellular connections on at all times at a you know this isn't i wouldn't call this a a cheap solution i think all in with the with the hd1 dome we're probably in like a 2500 price point or something like that um maybe 3 000. if you add the sim injector it would go a little bit up from there but that's optional you can put the sims directly in the hd1 dome um but the point really from this slide is not hey you should buy what i have it's more look at how modular this stuff is you can start with a you know a transit pro e or a a single modem and then you can add an upgrade from there and expand out the the solution to to meet your needs awesome well i think we can open it up for q a here we can spend just a few minutes digging through some of the the user questions and try and get some answers out to folks um eric if you've got any that jump out at you go right ahead otherwise i'm going to skim through here i can't really multitask and follow those questions as we're live but uh but yeah um i can take one one very common one is how to set up speedfusion that one we get all of the time so if you're inside your peplink dashboard you'd be clicking on that speedfusion cloud tab and you'd set up from there pick your data center and then click that wi-fi button and uh and set up the wi-fi name for that and then you're you're off to the races it's pretty straightforward um i'll defer to you travis but i think as long as you're in a care subscription and you turn on speed fusion cloud i know with the prime care devices i think you have a one terabyte of uh of data that's included on that and it's not built monthly which is really nice it's it's metered so if that one terabyte if you're only using it for zoom calls that could easily last you a year yeah depending on the model the the price point of the model there's a different size speed fusion cloud bucket that's included with it and so you know really our whole point there is we want people to be able to try it and see the benefits of that technology right it's seeing is believing on that type of stuff and so we think it's really important to just let people have that right out of the box and be able to try that and if you find that it's really useful for you it's a like you said it's not a monthly subscription you can top up for a year on a terabyte for 40 bucks and so that's not your cellular data right that's just protecting your your application data is what that bucket's for but it's just a really flexible format that we make it available to folks so they're not adding yet another monthly bill to their their connectivity uh their connectivity spend um another quick one uh people are asking about that um 5g verizon certification on the br1 pro for our customers what we're recommending they do is if they have a a legacy hotspot that they have it can be a you know five-year-old hotspot you can actually activate a verizon data plan um a hotspot data plan um on that old hotspot and then simply move the sim and it will auto update the imei from our experience that doesn't necessarily work with all data plans but we've had really good luck with that and then the verizon certification is is coming i think any day now or pretty much very soon so that's just something that i think has had folks holding off and that's the work around yeah i can't i can't make any promises on timelines with verizon certification um you know two of the three are certified right now and there's a reason that the third isn't and it's really out of our control unfortunately and so i just i can't make promises all i can say is we are trying as hard as possible to get those things through and it's not something that we've not done right or that there's some sort of deficiency in the product it's a it's a very new process um the 5g certification is very different than the 4g and so there's just been a lot of hiccups unrelated to the petlink device completely that is holding that up so i know it's frustrating for folks and i know people really want that and i want that but i just i don't have control over it and we're pushing as hard as possible to make that happen as fast as possible so bear with us please and you know i think another good thing that i've seen people do i can't i can't encourage people to to move sim cards from devices the carriers can have their different uh policies on which plans will work with which devices um but you can use you know a hotspot with wi-fi as land or if your hotspot has an ethernet port there's other ways that you can kind of bridge the gap between those devices in the interim but uh you know number one that those 5g devices are using verizon certified modules and so the platforms there it's capable in every level it's just getting the the rubber stamp on the paper to to say yes that's official now so again i apologize that it's taking so long but we're trying we're really trying the wheels of verizon move slow we've we've seen that but but um at least for my verizon business plan you know which is a plan made for hotspots uh to activate that it's switched over automatically updated the imei and the verizon portal everything was fine not breaking any rules from verizon um but you know for folks who are like what is the certification really in real world terms typically if it if there's not a certification when you call to activate a new line and you give them the imei of the modem that you can run into problems if it's not a verizon certified device where the database just doesn't recognize the device as a verizon device so that's what that means so that's why there's a need for for workarounds but um we can confirm it it is working on on our on our test uh sims and and it definitely is a verizon uh compatible device absolutely so i see one question about bandwidth bonding and you know for for this particular user it doesn't sound like you know making zoom work smoother is really the priority it's taking more than one kind of slow connection and making it into one fast connection that that bonding is definitely possible on most of our devices there's some i would say practical limitations to what makes sense or what's achievable with bonding so usually with bonding you want to combine connections that are roughly similar so you know cellular plus cellular yes landline plus landline yes cellular plus satellite no you can do failover and seamless handoff between those different connection types but oftentimes you know cellular and landline connections or cellular and wi-fi connections those are definitely possible combinations and we're working to improve those algorithms to make those even more possible and so you know that gets into a little bit of a trial and error as it stands but definitely if you have a device that has like two cellular connections bonding is absolutely possible on that and will provide a lot of benefits even even on the zoom calls like you said eric you don't have to use land smoothing to make zoom work better it's bonding alone will make those app those real-time applications work better because it can shift those packets from one connection to another right so you and some of your networks are really variable i mean i can be in one spot with a fixed antenna and i can sit there and watch verizon t-mobile and at t and the latency on any one of them can go up really high or the packet loss can go up really high i mean it changes literally in a matter of fractions of seconds so absolutely and it's it's so well it's so you know you get these devices and you have a 20 meg download speed on verizon i'm just making this up and a 10 meg download speed on a t and it's sort of natural to assume that if you bond these two connections together you're going to get 30 meg down right you know a plus 10 is and and it just doesn't work that way and we kind of when we talk to customers we're like i know the speed test is cool and i know it gives you that like feeling of oh i have something awesome focus on is the internet working and they're like yeah it works great i'm like don't worry about the speed test so what's happening when you have to run some of the traffic across two links is in order for it to balance it really is if you if you had a 20 mag and a 20 and a 10 meg typically what you'll see out of the combined is is a double of the slowest connection so if you have a 10 meg as your slowest connection double that and you'll see 20 and that's because it's got to put data down both streams and it can't put so much data down one stream and so little down another stream and then effectively put it all back together while maintaining that that connection quality so it's much more what the public device is trying to do is much more about connection quality than giving you a really cool speed test and it's just it can be frustrating for folks they're like oh but i just want it to combine and i'm like well then you need two really fast connections and yes it will then combine them but they have to be you know both operating at peak performance and then the second thing on bonding for folks is keep an eye on the latency of that connection um we're gonna do some really cool walkthroughs and qas coming up about speed fusion and how to like troubleshoot it so take a look at our youtube channel we're gonna start showing folks like hey if you have over 300 milliseconds of latency on the connection like the speed fusion tunnel will off i think it's 500 milliseconds is the default it'll not use that connection because it's like there's so much delay that i'm just going to not i'm going to bypass that because it's not helping so a lot that can get frustrating for folks when they're in like a heavy congestion area or they're like an rv event or rally because they're like how come my speech is not working i'm like it is it's just disabling that connection because it's so bad so um it's avoiding that traffic jam for you yeah exactly um one real quick one that i don't have to answer but i can just address someone asked about mesh if you go to guides.mobilemustap.com we have a complete wireless series including how to set up wireless mesh on either a mk2 or a transit series that has the wi-fi ap controller um so we have guides on how to do that and detailed youtube videos so there's links for that at guides.mobilemusktop.com i see one question about google phi and i think there's two layers to this one that i'll throw out there number one the pep link devices are compatible with google phy so you can get data only sims from google phi and all you got to do is plug the apn into the router i've used it myself many times and so many other users so number one they're compatible with our devices but you know google phy does connect to more than one network in any device outside of an android device it can only connect to one at a time and it can not hand off between two networks unless you manually tell it to basically if you have a specific google fi android phone then they can do more switching between those networks it's an extra layer of capability that they enable on those very specific models of phones but that type of capability is not something one sim in our device would be able to do but again it would be able to leverage the best network that that sim is able to see at any given location well i think we can wrap it up there thank you so much folks for staying on the line here um it's been fun for me i hope you folks found it valuable i do want to just thank you again eric for for number one all the all the effort you've put into peplink and and getting your users connectivity solutions that that make sense for them so go check out eric's website here at

This is a new format that we are bringing to life. Today I have two very special guests. Here on my left side is Tobias Gramm from Tividoo and here on my right side I have Dennis Hofheinz from Vitel GmbH. Dennis is the contact person for all technical matters. Dennis, do you like to wave too? (Dennis waves, Julia laughs) I haven't finished introducing ​​Tobias. He is the managing director of Tividoo GmbH which works a lot with public television channels to support them with live streaming. Did I get that right? Yes, among other things, we work with public television broadcasters. Mainly it is about connectivity, so internet connections in general. Live streaming is definitely a hot topic at the moment. Okay, what makes Tividoo different from other streaming service providers? I would say it is the great diversity we offer, so we are not just a streaming company. Instead,  we provide basic network technology and IT consulting that are more in the IT consulting and service area. But due to our background or where we come from, so from the TV area and from the experience we have, of course, we also cover the area of moving images and can combine these two worlds of IT and moving images very well. What we don't do now is produce moving images ourselves. There are enough video production companies that have cameras, etc., everything. These companies actually do productions. What we do is we offer these companies or TV broadcasters the opportunity to bring their films and broadcasts in adequate quality and bandwidth to the Internet or to the end users' TVs. Then we move on to the content-related part. Today we would like to mainly talk about the problems and challenges with live streaming. Simply to show, how such a collaboration can work well what problems actually exist and how they can be solved. You are welcome to share your knowledge with the community. What are the main issues you face every day? The main problems that we have dealt with a lot recently, is that live streaming has boomed extremely, and everyone who can hold a camera straight has tried live streaming. But network-related knowledge or the basics of how the Internet works are simply not available to a typical cameraman or camerawoman. And then the live stream fails in many areas, because the network is not stable enough or you attempt to stream via WLAN. Then you try to do the whole thing with really cheap means on YouTube and wonder why the connection somehow breaks off or does not run stably, as the foundation is missing. Yes, and this is where we step in to be the service provider and support for our customers. We help you build this foundation. We cover the basics for you. You can also take care of the streaming basics by yourself. These days, you can watch 2 or 3 YouTube videos and say, Hey, I'm a live streamer, it's all good”. Yes, you can pretend, but how old is the Internet now? Dennis? I think it is 30 years old and is based on connectionless communication and packet-based networks. It doesn't work as simply as plugging in a cable to have the data packets go from A to B. The difficulty that arises on-site is the lack of understanding of the technology, circumstances, or problems of using WLAN, DSL, or LTE lines. You have now addressed two important problems: on the one hand, guaranteeing fail-safe security because WLAN is not the most secure connection. It can also break. And it's just a data transmission path. What would you say, what advantages do the expensive Peplink devices have compared to a regular router? One of the advantages is definitely to ensure reliability. I can bundle several connections with one another. Another advantage is that I can use WAN smoothing technology to multiply a stream so that all the data packets that I sent off arrive at the destination. How is it actually at such events - these are rather one-off, or the need is not regular - is it even worth using a Peplink router for events? It's always worth it, because I need an Internet connection for every event nowadays, no matter where I am. And I need a stable internet connection. I don't necessarily need it for streaming, but I need it for everything that takes place in the whole production of that event. Yes, starting with communication, telephone, VoIP, research, and editorial PR meetings and networks. I need a stable Internet connection everywhere I work on-site. In the case of public radio and TV stations, for example, we now have a pilot project. There is no streaming application set up, but a complete site network. A site network between the broadcaster and mobile units, where the main concern is fail-safe data transmission and fail-safe communication, via audio for radio broadcasts, but also the transmission of video for TV purposes. And that is actually the basis of every event: That I have a fail-safe internet connection there. Okay, are there different levels of Peplink products? Yes, they offer all kinds of possibilities. I have different modular options there. For example, we also use load balancing as a failover function if the SpeedFusion tunnel fails. Bundling always needs a receiver. In other words, should the receiver ever fail, we have configured the router in a way that it automatically reverts to load balancing mode so that the Internet line does not fail completely, if the bonding tunnel fails. And how did you accumulate your knowledge, Dennis? I've been working in IT for quite some time. And that's how you develop knowledge (through experience). At some point, I came across Vitel. That's where I got to know Peplink. In retrospect I have to say “If I had known Peplink before, when I was still the manager of a data center, I could have really saved myself a lot of work. Peplink could have made everything much more convenient. You won't have to focus on expensive leased lines. But that is the subject of branch connectivity. That is a little different from what we are talking about today. Yes, and I've just been in IT my whole life. So my father was already studying computer science at the beginning of the 80s. I've grown up with it all my life. You learn streaming now in the Corona period, like so many people who are learning it now. You have to dig into that in order to understand people's problems and try to solve them together. Dennis, maybe you would like to say a little more about the technology behind the Peplink products? As Tobias said, you need to create a comparison. If you buy a random cheap router from any discount shop or electronics store, you will get a device that is made for private use. And of course, you can try to do the live stream with it. They are definitely great for birthdays or anything else so that the family can celebrate during pandemic times. However, if I want to do this professionally as a service provider, then I can't afford any small failure or poor image quality, or something like that. And of course, I need a device that works according to the industry standards. Let's compare that to a car. If I take my 15-year-old car, I can drive on the racetrack. When I go on a trip around any ring road, it works. But if I want to join a professional race with it, I definitely won't win it with this car. Then I need a sports car. Which, in turn, I have to master. And if I want to do that really well, then I also need to do a lot of setup work, and really put a lot of energy into adjusting all the details and minimize the risks so that everything works in the moment when it matters. Well, today, I learned that to host a good live event, especially for those on television, the standards are extremely high. You need the right tools to make the whole experience fail-safe and uninterrupted. Either you hire employees who then bring the know-how with them, like it is the case with Tividoo - or Vitel - for example. Or you invest a bit of money into upskilling your own employees, so they can use the Peplink devices optimally and get the most out of them. And even to choose the right device, you simply need a competent contact person. It doesn't help to drive a Ferrari through a zone with tempo limit of 30. It's not that much fun either. And you need the right vehicle for the right circumstances. And of course, the combo made up of the two of you (Dennis Hofheinz and Tobias Gramm) ideal for this kind of venture."}

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "hello and welcome to our latest webinar my name is sam norris and today i'll be joined by gideos hi everyone here at pepling i work with antenna related projects and i will be glad to share my knowledge thanks gideos um today we'll be looking at the antennas the theory behind them and how to choose the right one for your project and we're just going to give it another 30 seconds to a minute because there's still a lot of people joining okay i think that's enough time for ryan to be joined by now so um yeah we'll get going so pip blank's mission statement has always been unbreakable connectivity anytime anywhere antennas form an important part of this we'll start by looking at the theory and then we will move on to the applications and how the theory affects your deployments antennas can be thought about like a light bulb if you have a light bulb that doesn't have a reflector and it shines light equally in all angles it'll be similar to a zero gain antenna gain can also be thought about as how much you focus the light in a particular direction using a reflector the light will be brighter in the direction where the light is focused and there'll be less light going in the other directions you can also compare antennas to microphones and speakers in a similar manner an important thing to note is that the antenna doesn't amplify the signal or create energy it helps focus the transmission and reception an omnidirectional antenna is designed to transmit and receive 360 degrees around the antenna its radiation pattern can be thought about like a donut in the illustration we have here you can see what happens to an omnidirectional antenna radiation pattern as the gain is increased the increased gain the increase in gain flattens the doughnut simply put the higher the gain the less the angle of courage but the greater distance covered a direct antenna is designed to transmit and receive in a particular direction its radiation pattern can be thought about like a cone in this illustration we have you can see what happens to a directional antenna radiation pattern as the gain is increased the increase in gain extends the cones but makes it narrower similar to an omnidirectional antenna simply put the higher the gain the less the angle of coverage but the greater the distance covered there's a balance there's a fine balance between too little gain and too much gain if you have too high again the rolling of a vessel can cause a radiation pattern of the antenna to move above and below the antenna but if the gain is too low the vessel could be out of range of the tower at a shorter distance so different vessels have different role profiles so for example a large fury is not going to roll as much and you could safely go for a higher gain antenna whereas a smaller fishing vessel will probably roll a lot more and require a lower gain antenna you can mix and match your antennas and use lower gain antennas for one modem and a higher gain antenna for another modem but you should always try and use the same type of antenna for all connectors on a single modem okay thank you sam now let's go through some other key parameters you must know about the antennas so the first one is vswr it indicates energy reflection for instance when lte 5g modem is transmitting some of the energy is reflected from the antenna this happens due to impedance mismatch which is very difficult to achieve over the launch frequency range so vswr directly affects antenna efficiency important to note that it is possible to damage cellular modem if the vsvr is too high the common range is 1.5 2.5 and it would be better not to exceed value free the next one we would like to talk is efficiency not every antenna vendor provides efficiency information but this is one of the key parameters to consider it states how efficiently the antenna is converting received signal into electrical currents and vice versa the efficiency is provided in percent for instance if the efficiency is 30 that means 70 percent of received or transmitted energy is actually lost the interesting thing is that in theory the antenna may have a high gain an even good vswr but if the efficiency is bad it will lead to poor signals and bad performance in most cases efficiency varies from 30 to 90 depending on the frequency band and antenna type next let's talk about the different frequencies we would like to split them into several ranges like low mid and high bands this is done for simplicity reasons as in further slides we will talk about different band properties and we will tell you like low band or high band so you will know what it actually means attenuation is a gradual loss of a signal strength there are a couple of factors which affect it the first one is frequency so the higher the frequency the higher their tunisian second one is distance the longer distance will lead to higher attention and i'm sure you've already seen this in practice and the last one is physical surroundings so for example trees walls buildings and etcetera in other words anything what is between antenna and the cell tower installation areas we may divide into several main groups such as low medium and densely populated areas each of these groups will have several factors which need to be considered when choosing the right antenna for instance the low populated areas will have less cell towers to achieve this low bands are used low bands cover larger areas and have lower attenuation the main disadvantage disadvantage for us is lower performance this is because mainly narrow channels are used and therefore connectivity speed will be lower as well on contrary in densely populated areas you will find more cell towers to avoid cell congestion in these locations higher bands will be used which have higher donation and lower coverage in most cases the internet speed will be higher due to wider channel bandwidth when installing the antenna there are two more things to consider line of sight and cell tower congestion if there are direct objects between antenna and cell tower this will affect the signal strength and we already mentioned this however there's also effect called fresno zone if there are reflective surfaces along the path such as water smooth terrain or building roofs the radio waves will reflect and may affect the receive it sorry the received signal strength we have provided a picture showing a particular example for one frequency there are many online calculators and in if interested you can check the fresnel zone actually for different bands as well another thing to consider is cell tower congestion it may happen during weekends or rush hours if that is the case omnidirectional antenna can help as it will allow to connect to several cell towers rather than just one using directional antenna okay now let's talk about cable sign connectors so here at purpling we are using three types of connectors in this slide we show two of them the most common type is sma connectors and most of our products have this one we use different configuration for wi-fi and for cellular gps connection if we choose our antennas we already took care of it to make sure that antenna and router connectors will match so you don't need to worry about this part another type is qma so this one is a very reliable premium class connector it's very handy to connect if you want to connect many antennas in a compact area and later on sam will show you a video actually how it happens in action to connect qma you need to push them slightly and the internal mechanism will lock the male and female parts this can be done in seconds and i would say that very and also i would say very important once comma is connected you can forget it it will not disconnect itself the last type of the connectors is n-type these are a bit bulky in size however n-type is out-of-rated and it's recommended to use if ip rating higher than ip66 is needed to achieve on our products we use female on the equipment side and male on the antenna side okay now let's talk about the most common cable types each of these cables has its own constant pros so the first one rg174 is the thinnest one in diameter this cable is very flexible and its main disadvantage is attenuation and maximum frequency here at pebbling this cable is typically used for gps antennas only the another type is cfd200 this cable is a bit thicker and is about 5 millimeters in diameter but still very flexible and it can be used for signals up to 6 gigahertz so it covers all lte and 5g bands also it has relatively very low attenuation and you can see that six feet attenation for a six feet detonation it it it doesn't it's only about one db uh for a mid bands actually or the other two types like lmr 400 and 600 have ultra low attenuation and are suitable for longer cable runs the main disadvantage is cable flexibility they are quite rugged actually also they come at a price typically these cables are terminated using n-type connectors okay now let's jump to applications here at pebbling we have three main antenna product lines hummingbird for fix-it installation puma for mobile ones and uh stingray which i designed it having my time environment in mind for fixed installation fixed installation are the most common in low density populated areas in this area statically indoor antennas are not working or the performance is very low therefore external antenna will help to increase the signal strength and the quality if installed properly and now now let's take a look at hummingbird antenna we plan to release in the near future the antenna which we plan to release will have a very high gain and we plan to have it up to 10 dbi in certain frequency bands also one of our key differences it will have a active gps antenna which is compatible with pebbling routers the antenna will come in two options five meter cable with sma connectors and a half a meter cable with n-type connectors to use with extension cables for longer runs the enclosure is very reliable uv stable and design it withstand high wind loads just recently we did the simulation and it shows we should be able to pass 200 kilometers per hour wind loads so that's quite a lot actually two mounting options will be supported pull and wall mounting now i will ask sam to give a brief review about our maritime stingray antennas sam thanks gideos so the stingray is our new maritime antenna it has been designed for maritime the stingray 201 is a 2x2 antenna so there's two cellular coaxial cables and connectors the 401 is a 4x4 antenna as four cellular coaxial cables and connectors both stingray models also have the additional cable for the gps the 201 is perfect for routers such as the br1 and ubr lte the 401 is perfect deployments where more cellular modems are used and it will help reduce the number of physical antennas required when using category 18 or 5g models we've had these antennas tested and they can withstand up to 160 kilometers per hour of one load and all the metal parts are marine dragged stainless steel both antennas have the same rf properties the 401 is pretty much a double up of the 201 it'll be available this summer um an interesting side note on this one is that the frequencies also cover the wi-fi so you can actually use these antennas for wi-fi as well so very good for long range longer range wi-fi you just need some rp sma converters so installations on mobile assets such as patrol vehicles need to be low profile and compact so our puma range of antennas are perfect for these the low profile form factor means they can be installed with these and back to gideos okay uh if you don't mind i will just answer one question quickly there is a question about what cable length is hosting grade 201 and 401 so it's two meters actually okay now let's head on about puma antennas so puma antennas were designed at having mobile applications in mind and the main things to mention about these antennas are extremely wide bandwidth starting from six megahertz up to six gigahertz this basically covers all the lte and 5g bands you don't need to worry about any other intent actually and these antennas have a high gain high efficiency the enclosure is ip68 rated and also it was designed to have very low profile to reduce wind drag effect and lastly the design is robust and made from uv stable plastics we have uh many different antenna element configurations like 201 221 401 to meet all sort of different applications and i will talk about the number a bit later on actually okay here we see a summary table of peppling antenna series all our antennas are very wide bandwidth covering lte and 5g bands i mentioned it this couple times actually the exception is stingray antenna which actually is ultra wide bandwidth and it supports even megahertz band as well hummingbird antenna has the highest gain and will ensure you the best possible signal strength which will lead to the best possible performance for mobile applications we suggest to use pumasi puma series for maritime we can offer puma or stingray because well puma also can pass ip68 rating and for fixed installation you can actually use all those three types it depends on your location and requirements all our antennas have integrated active gps receivers compatible with battling routers and lastly all antennas were designed to be robust and bundle proof okay now let's have a few words about the antenna naming so antenna naming was designed to make it simple for you guys to remember so at first we have antenna serious name so in this example it's puma bar it can be stingray or hummingbird then we have three numbers which indicate antenna elements so no matter which series antenna you will take you can easily know that in internal antenna element configuration if we take this example so it shows 401 which means there are four lte elements zero wi-fi and one gps and if you will take another one two to one you know two lte two wifi one gps and so on the last three symbols are related to cable length connector and color and you can find those on our datasheets okay now sam let's get back to you again oh sorry guys i had my microphone on mute yes i'll start again so our antennas uh they come with different types of cables and connectors the pumas are available with sma and qma stingrays only come with smas and the hummingbirds have sma and end types our extension cables allow you to connect your antennas to the router at longer distances so this table shows you our puma antennas and which connectors and cable links are available this will help you select the correct antenna for your router and installation so the qma connectors are quick and easy to use and once they are connected they do not come loose however as they're not very common they can be expensive on the other hand sma connectors are much more common let's have a quick look at the different types being disconnected and reconnected first the sma so this is the one that a lot of people will be familiar with so you've got to screw it on and then when you unscrew it you've gonna unscrew it away so now let's have a look at the qma so as you can see you just push it on and then to remove it you have to pull the ring back and it releases the mechanism so the sma um they take a lot more space and the qmas are you can fit a lot more of them in a compact area so that's one of the main reasons we use them on the index because we we need that valuable space so all of our category 12 and below routers have two connectors per cellular modem since category 18 there are four connectors per modem the reason for this is additional frequencies are utilized at the same time this requires additional antennas these additional connectors and frequencies allow for higher throughput we regularly get asked if you need to connect all the connectors to antennas and can i use splitters the short answer is no splitters will not work and will cause issues and not connecting half of the connectors will result in bad throughput so these are some of the combinations of our antennas and routers for the devices which have wi-fi you'll need to select your intent depending on if you want the wi-fi from the exterior of your antenna or from the antennas on the router this means do you want the wi-fi lan and wein to be broadcast from the exterior antenna or from where the router is located let's have a look at a scenario where a cat 18 hd4 mbx is going to store with two meter coaxial cables to boom your antennas for this you can use two puma 401s with qma connectors and two four two ones with qma connectors you also require adapters for the wi-fi connectors to invert from qma to sma so for this scenario the antennas are located slightly further away from the router an extension cable is required you'll also require adapters as this is an hd2 category 18 model sma connectors are used on the router the qma connectors used on the hd4 category 18 version for this setup we're using a transit duo with three stingray 201s two of the stingrays are used for cellular and one is used for wi-fi you could also use one stingray 401 and 1 201 depending on the installation location and how the aesthetics are the stingray used for wi-fi will need two sma to rp sma adapters this is an outdoor installation of our hd4 ip67 for this you'll require two ant 100s which are four by four antenna with n-type connectors they're supplied with three meter cables so the router antenna must be installed within three meters of each other unless you want to use extension cables let's now have a quick look at some of the do's and don'ts of antenna installations these are all opposites of each other so i'm only going to cover the do's so obviously on the splitters you don't want to use splitters um spurs literally split the signal received a one to two splitter will split the signal by at least half a one to four splitter will reduce the signal down to below 25 percent high quality cables will help avoid unnecessary loss the fewer the connectors the better each connector will increase loss you want to place the antenna in the best location possible preferably a 360 unobstructed view of the horizon this is not always possible but the closer to it the better and you also want to select the correct antenna for your application we've created antenna selection guide which is downloadable now the link to this will be available in our forum and in the follow-up email so does anyone have any questions there's been a few questions that are coming over the time there um so the first question there that i can see um is the hummingbird also wi-fi signal compatible um gideous do you want to answer that one yeah yeah i would like to answer this one actually so in general we can touch all our antennas puma hummingbird and stingray as i mentioned it all of our antennas are very wide bandwidth and we support wi-fi signals for sure and i would like to know that we support both we support 2.4 and we support also five gigahertz range as well siding from 4.9 up to going to six gigahertz actually so if you take hour antenna you don't need to worry about this part i see another question but i think i would need your help sam about what distance can antenna catch signal from the cell tower so yeah maybe we can take a maritime example because well it's uh no objects in between yes if for distance um from cell towers this is very dependent on the location you're in and how the cellular environment is set up so i know from my experience that some countries are really great for um at sea range so for example um i've seen devices connected at 80 kilometers offshore uh and that was um i think it was 80 to 85 kilometers and that was off norway uh italy and greece and in those three countries i've seen great ranges offshore um some countries where i've seen not so great ranges offshore um the netherlands but that one is kind of because the the country is pretty flat so you've got to think about the cell towers are actually going to be quite low on the horizon so that's kind of explained by the location um and yeah there's some other country so it really depends on the location and how how the um how the cellular environment set up but our antennas can can definitely do some really good ranges do you have anything to add to that gideous um no no actually no okay um okay so we've got a another question here uh what is the maximum recommended cable length from the pip wave to the puma series antenna using lmr400 uh do you want to ask that one two years yes i would like to answer this one actually there is no cable or length limitation and it can be one meter or 100 kilometers it doesn't matter all what matters is actually the attenuation so uh we provided a rough estim a rough estimated attenuation for different frequencies and you can also check the cable data sheet i'm sure they have this information as well so and and then you can estimate how much it is acceptable to loss i would say that you know it it would be good to keep again it depends on on received signal strength and if the signal is very strong then i don't know probably 10 db loss is still acceptable but if the signal is weak then you should you would want to have a as minimal attention as possible so so there is no direct answer to this yeah so i'll just add a few points to that um i mean i as a as a general rule i say if it's going to be um an lmr kind of 200 or the uh the cable types that are supplied with the antennas i try i'll try and recommend you keep it under five to seven meters um for lmr 400 i would say try and keep it under 10 to 15 meters and then lmr 600 you want to keep it under under kind of 20 meters if possible that's just kind of a recommendation what what i've been recommending but it really depends on your own station your location things like that one thing to think about is with some routers like our hd4 mbx there's 16 antenna connects on that so that's a lot of coax cable you can have to run so if you if you're going to have your antennas 20 meters away from your router and you want to run 16 coax cables that's a massive job you're really you're really much better off figuring out a way of locating that route and much closer to the antennas and you will see the benefits of that on that unless antenna loss as well um okay we've got another uh question here from um alessandro is it necessary to use um arresters for the setup so lightning protection or when would you recommend to use it um so i would recommend you use that if you do have the um if you do have the antennas located very high up on a mast or on the top of a roof um and as long as you've got the router earth and that as well that'll help avoid issues but yeah lightning nervouses can be added but you really want to make sure that you're using the correct ones that don't induce too much loss because some can induce quite a bit of loss do you have anything to add to that gideous um no actually no um no okay um next question is from adam is there a concern having multiple cellular antennas right next to each other is there a recommended spacing between the antennas um yes there is um there's some um pretty good calculations that have been done um and there's some recommended minimum recommended distances and really the the closest you should really have an antenna would be um half a meter apart but really if you can be 90 centimeters apart um then that is that's really good if you give me a meter and a half that's even better um this this obviously doesn't apply to our the multiple antennas where there's four antennas in one um because obviously you can't pull them apart and move them apart so if you're installing an hd4mdx with k18 um and four stingray 401s if they're installed kind of one and a half meters apart and a square that'd be that'd be really good um if you can get vertical separation between them as well that's even better so you if you installed two kind of on a level above and to a level below i mean you can even turn two upside down so two are under a spreader and two or above um and that keeps cable runs nice and short as well so there's lots of different ways you can think about but ultimately the more space you can get the better for the diversity and the lte um a question here from collins um can the antenna cable length be adjusted say twice more if requested um gideous do you want to answer that one um yes i can answer um we are always open uh for let's say uh special cases but it comes at the at the quantity actually so the answer is yes but well it depends uh james asks what tools do you recommend to figure out heights for installing the lte um you mean you like installing the antennas how high up because ultimately the higher up they can be installed the better that's going to give you sorry obviously in maritime it's going to give you a bit of range on the horizon and then if you're in residential or um residential installations or even suburban commercial things like that the more height you get the more above obstructions you're going to be to to help move that friends or zone that kid has talked about it's going to help move that frontal zone up and away from trees and parked vehicles and things like that so yeah it really depends on on your installation there um but there are there are um there are links um [Music] there are link calculators that you can use and you can you put in what frequencies you're using the distances and things like that and they can calculate the kind of what what they recommend um james uh is asking can we speak with pep link for design recommendations and advice um our partners can come and talk to us directly about it for end users you can make an inquiry with us and we will put you onto a local partner that will know your local cellular environment and they'll be able to provide you with local knowledge and such because every country is very different um and yeah you think lte is the same but they they are independent different in different countries um so your local partner is going to be your best board of call for a to set you up with a with a really good design um do we have any other questions there i see there's a there's a question in the um in the chat there from um john are there sma rp adapters that will connect to the stingray mounts um we don't have those um as a part number um i'm not sure if we are going to have them but i can definitely um let you know where where to get them from though there are quite a common um kind of rf um fitting so it's not something we were really looking at stocking because it's uh it's easy to source locally um sean has asked will this be sent out or available on your website yes um it will be available we will um the best place to check for it is in the email which will be sent out in a day or two so there'll be a follow-up email um and there will also it'll also be posted on our forums so have a look in our forum there um and we'll also put a lot of these questions and answers up there as well um so that the answers will be written out there and there was another question there earlier on about the slides and there was a where is it okay so rob asks is there any chance the slides will be able afterwards too looks great for reference yep so we'll make some of these um slides available um if the slides that you really liked aren't there just uh send us an email and we can send them through you but yeah the forum again be the best spot to look for that uh doug miller if you have two two by two lte antennas for category 18 would you connect one antenna to the main connectors and one to the two auxiliaries or the other round so this is um this is one that um can be a bit confusing um and it's um what you've got to do is cross polarize them so um i can send you the details the technical details and modems so you'll actually be able to see the um which in which uh modem which connectors are used for which and you'll be able to then figure out that but definitely cross polarization of them is is the best way so yeah uh his question here um how do your antennas compare against similar panorama antenna which been widely used uh with our routers for some time now um gideous do you want to answer that one um i don't think we did any benchmarking tests with panorama but from benchmark compared to other vendors for some vendors we were performing similar or slightly better and for with others compared we were betters but i can only guess i i was looking at the panorama specs so if you will take a similar antenna and if yeah there are no lying on the specs because that happens with some other vendors actually so we should perform similar okay um so do we have any other questions there okay so i think that's all there's no more questions coming in so thank you for attending today and thanks gideous for being my co-host if you have any more questions please get in touch with us um the forum is a great great place to go um if you you can ask questions on there there there's always good responses and a wealth of knowledge thank you very much everyone and have a great day cheers"}

Our Partners at FrontierBV and IBSCY combined their efforts to overcome challenges their customers face. With Frontier providing assistance and knowledge and IBSCY implementing the solution for Multimarine. Multimarine specialises in mechanical and marine engineering in Cyprus. Its areas of operation include marine support services, inspection and maintenance for numerous international clients. They operate on a dry dock in which a vessel is flooded to allow ships on board to be drained and repaired on dry platforms. This means there is no cabling from any internet service provider which therefore corresponds to poor internet connectivity and disruption to their operations. Prior to Peplink, solutions offered included a point-to-point antenna which sent internet to the dock from more than 500 meters distance. The issue with this solution is it did not guarantee reliable unbreakable connectivity. Instead many connectivity problems continued to occur due to weather conditions and the “line-of-sight” between antennas. To overcome these issues and ensure Unbreakable reliable connectivity as requested by their clients, IBSCY proposed the use of Peplink devices and technology to bypass these issues. The solution included the deployment of Balance 310X serving as the entry point as well as offering unique failover features enabling switching between connections automatically if one failed but also several WAN functionality, a fibre connection and cellular via a SIM and Wi-Fi. In addition to this, 6 other devices were used to ensure the internet was well received throughout the whole vessel. 3 tiny but mighty AP ONE AC Mini indoors and 3 AP Pro ACs outside, its all-metal IP67 enclosure stands up to even the harshest weather conditions. Peplink mission continues to provide solutions to their users' issues allowing them to continue doing what their best at and leaving the rest to Peplink. Peplink. Unbreakable Connectivity. Anytime. Anywhere."}

So, what are your challenges? Network availability and speed of connections vary based on the vessel’s location. Peplink combines any connection to ensure connectivity is always available. Incumbent satellite solutions can no longer accommodate the rising bandwidth requirements for streaming IPTV, access to email and company servers as well as cloud services. To avoid data cost spiraling out of control, Peplink can automatically prioritize data usage to lower cost connections, such as port WiFi before LTE, or satellite. Here is an example. This is a 55 meter motor yacht. We installed a Pepwave HD4 MBX directly beneath where the antennas are. The MBX is capable of combining the bandwidth of up to four cellular links into an unbreakable, high-speed SD-WAN connection. It supports interchangeable LTE cellular modules which can be simply upgraded to 5G or any future mobile technologies. It can receive Cellular offshore to minimize satellite bandwidth cost and also supports WiFi near marina facilities. The HD4 MBX also comes with 8x PoE outputs to power your IP phones, cameras, and access points. To reduce cable needs on the yacht, we installed a Peplink SD-Switch to provide additional ports for your extra devices. The whole system is fully manageable with InControl2 to remotely monitor, troubleshoot and configure your network. To avoid changing SIM cards up the mast we added an SIM Injector, which adds up to 150 meters of flexibility between the router and the SIM cards, enabling you to place the cellular router in the best location for cellular reception. The SIM Injector adds up to 8 SIM cards. If you cross international boundaries, you can also use it to switch between multiple SIM cards, preventing roaming charges and maintaining unbreakable connectivity. Reliable Internet connectivity can provide enhanced enjoyment onboard and increased navigational capabilities by providing reliable access to online resources such as nautical charts, weather reports and information about the nearest marina, additionally connectivity for the guests and crew is becoming something that is expected onboard. Internet Radio, TV, news and social media as well as secure corporate communications are essential at sea. Peplink provides unbreakable maritime connectivity."}

we've still got a few more people joining there and the numbers have gone up uh quite roughly just in the last few seconds even so we'll give everyone a bit more time to join uh i've just got a bit of housekeeping here we've got the questions and answers that you can ask um martin has already asked a question there everyone's mics and cameras are disabled yes that is correct we cannot hear you when we cannot see you um i don't have my camera on i've just got the [Music] the slideshow on at the moment so you should be able to see the starter slideshow and we will be recording this and it will be available on our forum at a later date um the chat is there as well um there are a few people see a few things there as well um during the whole webinar if you've got any questions um or comments on what is um going on because i will be doing some live demos feel free to chime in and i can always add some additional things and if needed okay so welcome to this webinar which is all about how to get the best out of your pep link so piplank's mission statement is unbreakable connectivity anytime anywhere this has become even more important with the events of the past year so today's webinar is aimed more at general users rather than our partners so the partners that have joined us please don't hesitate to ask if you want me to cover something in more detail and the topics we'll be covering today include cellular modems things such as apn details resetting a modem uh common cellular modem problems troubleshooting and solutions we'll also be looking at outbound policies so albion policies control which traffic users which when and we'll go through some different situations and examples of how to configure them we'll then also have a brief look at some of our antennas including our puma and our new stingray antennas for maritime so i'm now going to switch over to the interface of an hd4 mbx the model i'm using has category 18 modems okay so this is the main dashboard page uh many of you will be familiar with this um and this is the main page that you will be greeted with when you log into your router so first of all i'm going to have a look at the cellular modem here so i've only got one sim card active in this device at the moment i was planning on taking some kind of my phone and put in there but i just remembered i haven't done that um so if we click on the details here beside this one it opens up a window so these are all details um around this cellular modem so this isn't cellular 2. so for most users um so for most users leaving the most senses default will be sufficient so things here like the networking mode is auto and that kind of stuff as auto will be sufficient for most people and you can rename your connection something that will allow you to remember it better so i'm going to rename this one meteor as that's the provider could be saying just a sim card just so you know which sim cards which i've got um just one sim card in here at the moment so i have just selected sim card a so it's only trying to use sim card a so for the carrier selection this is something that you might want to use if you're roaming so if you're not in your home country and you'll be able to select a network um that might perform better than the one that the route has automatically selected so you can manually select here by doing a scan this does take about two minutes or one to two minutes so i'm not going to do it right now but it will disconnect you at the time it'll disconnect that cellular connection uh and scan for a new for another network and then you'll be able to select from all the networks that are there you can also select whether you use lt only or 3g only um generally auto is sufficient but sometimes people only like to use alt here so you can select that there as well fan selection you can also select a band so if you know that a band is as bad in a scenario you can disable it for example at the moment here you can see that i am connected on band 20 so i could if i wanted to disable band 20 now and then it wouldn't use that so i could do a speed test now before i disable it and i would know how what my throughput would be on band 20. um and then save this without bandwidth and i'll reconnect on another band do another speed test and you'll know the difference between the speeds on the different bands um that's the very basic way of testing the different bands but you can play around with it and and see what suits you in a different location so obviously if you do this kind of configuration it's it's only going to be suited to the location you're in if you move to a different port there's the bands are going to be different and that kind of stuff so generally you're best off leaving it with all the bands available to the router so without a roaming you can have it disabled so like there you can then enable it for any countries you can have then create an allowed countries list or a denied countries list so an allow countries list could be used somewhere like in the european union where you might have a data package that allows data to be used throughout europe you could enter the mcc or the mobile country codes of all the countries that are covered by your plan in there alternatively if you know you're operating in an area that's got a country that you you're not allowed to use because it's going to be a massive data bill you can enter those mcc's there so you don't get a sudden surprise the authentication generally you're going to leave that as auto okay now the operator settings sometimes this will be automatic i i've left miners auto here because it's automatically filled it in if that doesn't work you can manually enter it under by changing to custom and putting the apn the username and the password there generally the apns will be available online if you search the carrier and the apns but sometimes you will be given custom apn details by your carrier that you have to enter so you might want to check with your your carrier first the sim pin if your sim has got a pin on it you'll want to enter that here you can also disable the pin um mine is currently disabled already but if it was enabled you could click here and click on disable pin and that just makes it a lot easier to use the pin because it's not going to get confused so the bandwidth allowance monitor here this allows you to set limits on a individual wham so just make sure that you don't go over your allocated data allowance i recommend that you set the data limit just below your allowance by about one percent or so so for example if you had a data limit of 100 gigabytes i would set it at 99 gigabytes what this means is that the route will stop using that sim card before that just before the data limit is reached the next thing we've got here is the signal threshold settings so this dictates the minimum signal that the cellular router will use on that modem um you can change it here just by on the the signal bars but you can also actually click on the help button here and click here and then you can actually manually enter numerical numbers here these question marks that you'll see all over the device are very helpful they will quite often unveil hidden menus like this and advanced features so one thing that i'm going to show you now is how to reset a modem so this is just to reset the modem not to reset the whole router so you might want to do this if you have if the cellular carrier tells you to restart your device or if you notice that a band or something has stopped working or through it's got bad you can come here into your details on a cellular modem and you scroll down to the cellular settings here and you click on the question mark and beside it here you can click on that you want to reset the selling module and you click here then when you click on yes it'll reset that modem you don't need to save and apply the settings when you do that modem reset you can just close this window but if you have changed settings here like these band settings etc you do need to scroll down to the bottom and click on save and apply here i'm not going to click on save and apply because these settings i don't actually want to save so for this example today um i'm going to use uh i've got the single sim card and wi-fi wan and the internet connection we can pretend that the ethernet connection is a vsat connection it's not actually um but we can just pretend it is for the outbound policies and that we're going to cover um something else we didn't cover there in the cellular that i'll just go back to now on the very bottom we've got the health check settings so generally i use a smart check option and if this fails if it says smart check fails it generally means that the sim card is connected to a network but is not getting internet so this can be due to a few things but common issues are the sim card has not been activated the data allowance has been exceeded or the apn details been incorrectly added so um if you see it saying smart check failed don't go on to say if you go on disabled and it goes and then it goes green and says connected generally what you'll find is that yeah it's made it look like it's connected now but actually you'll find that the internet is still not working so usually if it fails this it means that the internet is not working you can also use dns ping or http lookup so they're available here in the drop down box again you can check on the little question mark here that will give you a whole lot more information of each one so now we're going to go back to the main dashboard so i'm going to close out of this so another thing that you might want to do with the cellular modems is have a look at um any text messages received so these could be messages from a carrier saying how much data you've got left and things like that so you can click on advanced here and then on the left hand side you scroll all the way down to sim toolkit wait for that to load cellular 2 because that's the one that's got sim card in it and you can select sms and it will load the sms's that have been received by that sim card so there we go we've got one that's been received you can also use the ussd codes if your carrier supports them so you can submit code that way for the uss decodes you'll want to consult with your [Music] local partner or with your carrier about what us ussd codes can be used so do we have any settings about the cellular modem settings i've seen a few questions here so um the first one i'm going to answer is from david um will you discuss the speed fusion cloud it hasn't been clear this webinar but i will briefly go over that um in a second um so yeah so the speed fusion cloud is our speed fusion bonding uh through our own servers so it's very easy to set up i don't have it set up on this device and i've already used my free trial on this device so i can't re-enable it again um but i can show you i think i've got it hidden at the moment so let's go to the setup of it so there we go so generally by default when you log on to your device it'll be displayed here under the speedfusion cloud as a tab of the phone um i won't be able to get an activation key because i've already used it and i can't access the settings because it's it's not activated but it's very simple you just choose your location and it'll connect automatically you don't need to set up any of your own servers or anything like that and okay so there's a question from benjamin when using the speed fusion engine cam in a remote location with different cellular carriers and slots a and b how does one make sure that the router is alternately using the best sims from the best cellular carrier in a specific location and that's something that's a little bit hard to do because it's something that you're gonna have to do manually because when a sim card's connected it's not using the other one at all it's not connected to that network or anything and it's only got uh it's focused on that sim card so if you want to test that and see if the other one's any better you've actually got to manually change it over and test that one um so obviously the speed fusion cam um the duo one has dual modems so you could have someone remotely looking at that while the the cameraman's in the field but generally if you if you've got um a dual mode and router and you've got two sim cards and modems one and two not so not slots a and b on the same modem from different carriers you can you'd be able to compare those in real time and that's the best way to compare it is those two um antoine uh is it possible i want to afford uh the received sms's to an email address no it is not but we do have some things in the apis of how of um what you can do with sms's um i think it will be possible to create your own api call that would forward them on um but we don't have that at the moment on the router uh from brandon uh why does lte a a drop off periodically and how do you lock it in so lte and lta um the lta part is a um feature of the networks and lte means it's connected and is on a single cellular frequency if you [Music] if it displays lte a it means it's using a secondary frequency um my one at the moment isn't using a secondary frequency so it's not showing lte a uh and this is a feature of the networks it's not something that we can control so it's not possible to lock it in like is on lte or 3g it's not possible to force it to only use ltea it's saying that the network allows um to happen or not um so that's something that we we don't have any control over from the router side um david's asking i need support for speed fusion the best method for this if you need support you can you can request support via support portal that is the best way to reach to get support and i'd also recommend that you reach out to the partner who provided the equipment to you usually the partners have got very good local knowledge of the sim cards and the local cellular environments and things like that so they'll use they'll be um your first port of call for information and and help um the question from sean there may there's maybe a support question but using m in vos any best practice for carrier selection i've seen the mv mnvo names show up in the carrier section option but then the name of the master carrier showing up in the carry name yes so that this is something that does happen here so for example um my carrier shown up here is meteor um if i go and do a carrier selection i believe this might show up as three island because meteor doesn't actually exist anymore meteor but i believe their uh name is still broadcast on the network so it's now three so i'm just gonna do a scan here and i'll show you that so um just in a second that'll come up and i'll come back to a second once that scan is completed sean um roman's asking how to set a bonding stream properly for a video stream this is very much dependent on your requirements is it something that you want a video stream for a very short time and you want to use you can you can use as much data you need for that time or is it a much longer string that you just want a bit of reliability there it really depends on that so you can look at things like in the speed fusion settings now obviously for broadcasting you definitely want to be using speed fusion so then having a look into the speed fusion settings that things such as the land smoothing the level of that and forward area connection things like that you want to have a look at okay so just back to the question earlier there the um you can see here now that my carry selection is done so i think this is kind of what you're referring to with the mvnos um i've got four carriers showing up i've got uh well three actually there's vodafone island three with 3g only and then air and three with lte so i don't actually see the uh meteor broadcasting as a network as such but it's three that is um sorry air is the network that i am using so here is the one that i'm actually subscribed with for this sim card and that will be the one that i'm actually connecting to so this would be kind of a similar example to that where i would select here click ok on that um but then up here it's showing and it's actually showing an nvmeno name so it's i think it's in the reverse to what you explained but it's it's the same kind of situation there where it's it's kind of a naming thing that is happening on the networks um okay so the next thing there's a question there from david i've got four devices and priority one so it depends on what device you've got if you've got a device such as our br1 um some of the other devices can only do a single one at a time even though they've got multiple ones so you can follow between them this is an hd4 mbx so i can lose all of these connections and priority one at the same time if i wanted to um i could have summoned priority two um so it's cellular two and three as such and it's as simple as dragging and dropping in there so it really depends on the model you've got if if you um want to if dave if you want to let me know what model router you've got there i can answer that question better um samuel santiago is asking i want to use my pipping grouch as a fail over when will that be covered in this webinar um yes it will be i'm going to do a the next section i'm going to do is going on outbound policy so you will your question will be answered in that on how to create a rule to do that okay so i'm just looking at and a few more questions here i just want to get these questions of cellular out of the way before we move on to the next uh section now uh so is it possible to uh robert us is it possible to set a daily limit instead of a monthly limit um i don't believe we've got that at the moment so yeah it's a case of um let's get back to it yeah so it's a daily limit and we've got a start day so it can't be a daily limit um for that feature i would recommend i think if you ever look on the phone there might be a few other requests for that i can look up and fill up on that view martin but that's something that could be there because i do know there are packages out there that do allow you say five or ten gigabytes a day um how much dust does it use is that regarding the um the cellular router or smart chip i'm assuming you mean smart check so smart checkers um doesn't use very much data because what it actually does is um it doesn't um create health checks unnecessarily it actually monitors the traffic that's going out and coming back to make sure that the traffic is successfully being delivered if there is no traffic going from the router then it will generate small amounts of data but that's kind of why it's called smart checkers because it's really minimizing the data load that it's using if you're using ping or dns it's going to be constantly using a small amounts of data to do a health check there okay uh yeah uh question here from david so yeah you're using the soho router so yeah the soho i'll have to double confirm that but i believe that's a single wan router um so you can only use um the single one at a time you can fail over i believe you can fail over the cell leader um but yeah if you want you can send us a message the email address at the end of this and we can look into it exactly for you question here from bruce um priorities what moves you from the two to the one so you literally click on it here and drag and drop it so i'm going to do cellular two and you can drag it and drop it into the next one down your next priority down it's as simple as drag and dropping that's it a question from sean when using wi-fi as wan source is there any priority which the wi-fi antennas used um for example we have one on board on on the antenna on the mast so i'm assuming you mean the roofs that have got two antenna connections for the wi-fi you should be connecting both those antennas to exterior wi-fi antennas uh it's not a case of one useful and ones when they're both used for both lan amway if you are using a for exterior wi-fi wand you might then also want to put a wi-fi access point on the interior of the vessel as well um brandon asks what is the quantitative value in ic2 when you're looking at bandwidth reporting is that bandwidth being used and is there a way to run a speed test remotely the select alternative band remotely um there's a few ways you can manually run a test one is using the speed fusion time that's already up you can run a test another way is using our wan analyzer test which you would need another pikmin device somewhere on the internet uh so that's under system [Music] when analysis here so you would set a device as a server that could be a fusion hub in the cloud and then on this remote device you see as a client and you put in the um ikea address of it and you can run a test one to win as such um the easiest way though would be with a speed fusion tunnel that's that's the easiest way the panels are there and you can run test them um from bruce okay the priorities wasn't clear if you have a sim on one and another and two what are the conditions that probably two some will be used um so let's say for example i'm going to remove uh wan one i'm gonna remove everything down to karate four except for the cellular so for example if you've got um a sim card that you primarily want to use like the one i've got here in pro and priority one um and then you've got some cards and priority two the sim cards and priority two would be used when sim card one fails that's gonna start using them um another way you can do this is via um the outbound policies which we're going to cover soon um if you've got advanced outbound policies you're going to want to just leave everything here and priority one so i'll explain that in a second anyway so let's shift these up um i think i might have kicked myself out because i'm using control and i just changed the lands so yeah so i think we're going to move now on to the next section which is about [Music] the outbound policies so if you're using advanced outbound policies i recommend you have all your ones in priority one and so let's go here okay so on the outbound policies now i'm going to do a bit of a live demo um but first of all i'm going to go through some of the policies here so the the most commonly used policies in maritime uh weighted balance priority and enforced other ones are used um but these are the three in my experience that are most commonly used in maritime so i'm going to cover these three um these three policies and explain kind of what they do so weighted balance allows you to assign traffic to different lengths and ratios based on sessions this works great for load balancing and sharing traffic between multiple links the cellular we recommend that you set each way at the same ratio because the vessels are moving and cellular connection speeds are always changing if you have a connection with fixed speeds let's say 10 megabytes per second download and a 2 megabytes per second upload along so another connection that has a connection speed of 20 megabytes download and four megawatts upload so twice the speed on one connection is on the other one um what would you use as your weighted balance ratio so you can say they're in the chat so we've got a two connections one one has got 10 meg down two meg up when two's got 20 meg down and four megabytes upload what would you set your ratio at um okay so i would set the ratio for that at one to two um obviously you can also set it two to four three to six four to eight all that is they're all the kind of same so the weighted balance does not apply to speed fusion profiles as it cannot detect the traffic in a tunnel so this is just for traffic that's going out over this connection the next policy we're going to look at is priority simply put this route all the specified traffic across the preferred connection as long as that connection is healthy when a connection is not healthy or not available traffic is then rooted over the next available connection so this rule can be used to direct traffic at a speed fusion tunnel the third one we're going to look at is enforced enforced means that specific traffic will only be able to root over a single defined connection and boards can also be used with a speed fusion tunnel so enforce then force rule will also even work even if that wam is down so if you create an enforce rule then it forces it to say a sally lilling and that sally link is not working that crap just will not go out to the internet because it's got nowhere to go so next um i'm going to do some um some live outbound policies here with you just so you can kind of get an idea of um the examples of of what we're doing and how we can do it let me just refresh the main dashboard here okay so i'm just going to disable the ones i'm not using so let's say for example in this example we've got three brands a v-set a cellular and port wi-fi so generally on a on a yacht what you're going to want to do is use the port wi-fi as priority one and if that's available you don't want to use anything else you just want to use a free port wi-fi then if that's not there so the boat's out of port or the wi-fi is down you then want to use the cellular and then as a last resort you can use the satellite that's there for if the cellular if you're out of range is selling on a remote hearing such so to create an outbound policy you go to advanced and click on outbound policy so first of all though i'm actually going to show you the the network on this device because that helps you understand what we're directing where so currently i've got um three networks here the base network and then two vlans we can create a third one as well so i'm just going to create this here while everyone's watching so you can see what's happening so we give it an ip address i'm going to give it the ip address one further up than that and we can call this business and give it a vlan id i'm going to give it 53 just to match there this little bit here just match that one the dhcp server range again that's just within the range of the subnet and then we can save and apply that to save and then apply the changes up here so now we've got an additional vlan there so these vlans can be used to separate your traffic into different easily to manage networks so now we go to the advanced settings and we look at the outbound policy as you can see here there's currently a default rule in here which is http https persistence at the rule that's just always put on the routers there as default so next we can create a rule so click on traffic uh who cellular oh okay so source any so the source is where the traffic is coming from again click on question marks it'll give you a lot of information there of what it actually is so on the source we can select any ip address ip network mac address or client associated ssid we want to catch a traffic anywhere on this device that will capture it from any of those vlans we just looked at if you select ip network you can put in the ip network of a network say the the business network we just created 53.0 uh and that would then then this rule would only apply to the traffic originally from that business network but we're going to do any for this one destination again we want that any because we don't care where that traffic is going we just want to do we want to have control over it protocol you can define the protocols here as well so you can select from a predefined protocol or you can create your own one so you could know the tcp support port that you want to be any port single port or report range you can also select things such as udp ip and even dscp so those are a bit more advanced features there but definitely they've got uses and certain applications for maritime if needed the next thing we're going to look at here is the algorithm so we've already covered um three of the algorithms and we can now create a rule using the logarithm which was already selected so the way to balance so we want this all traffic to balance on the cellular so i'm going to see everything apart from the cellular wands to a weight of zero so we bring these all down and then the last rule here is when no connections are available what do you want to do you can either drop the traffic and that means that the traffic's not going to go to the internet or you can allow it to fail all through to the next rule what that means is that you can load balance on four cellular connections here but if they all fail you can then have another rule here below that rule and it could be called fail over to vsat and that again could be source in e and then the final rule could be um enforced and vsat and because it's the last rule at the very bot or it's not at the moment you can drag and drop it because it's the last rule at the bottom and we can get rid of this one um it's the last rule to be matched so it can be enforced one because that's the last b set you wanted to use um i'm going to create another rule here now that's going to allow you to automatically fail over to um or change back over to the port wi-fi when you enter back into the form so rules are matched from top down by the way so the first rules matched if your traffic matches the rule it stops searching for another rule um and it follows that rule so i'm going to u call this one use port wi-fi so again source any because it's all traffic destination any and i'm going to set this rule as priority but in the priority i only want to have um the uh port wi-fi which is the wi-fi ran so i'm going to drag everything else to lowest priority so even though it's priority you can have just one way in there because if you used enforced you wouldn't be able to use this failover at the bottom here fall through the next rule you wouldn't be able to select that if it was enforced but that's why i'm using priority and then removing all the other connections so priority is just a single one which is the port wi-fi so we're going to save that so with these three rules that we've created here i haven't applied them yet but with these three rules what it means is that the traffic on the device is going to match with this first rule if port wi-fi is available and you're going to use that port wi-fi if the port wi-fi is not available it's going to fill through to the next rule and the next rule is load balancing and that's going to load balance on all four cellular connections so what's going to happen here is even for example right now because i've only got one cellular connection enabled it's going to put all the traffic over that one cellular connection if that last remaining cellular connection fails it's going to fall through the next rule again the next rule is enforce the vsat so these rules will then work backwards as well when you when you return to sell it from vsat back to cellular and then back to port wi-fi so what this means is you can change over between them all so is everyone um follow me here on this give me a thumbs up if you understand the these three rules and kind of how they interact with each other awesome so does anyone have any questions about this kind of conflict because this way what i've done here with this config is just for all the traffic on the device i'm not i'm not concerned about an individual device and what it's doing this is just all the traffic is following the same profile what i'm going to look at next is i'm actually going to go in now and create rules that just apply to individual devices um the first one i'm just going to look at some of your comments and questions and answers here um so i've got a question um but these outbound policies guys don't apply to speed fusion this is just traffic that's going to be breaking straight out of the internet from the device if you're not using speed fusion um so the questions running into that hot failover and things like that they don't actually apply necessary to this um this failover what we call what we call a hard failover it actually drops the connection reconnect if you want to avoid that you'll need to use speed fusion which will give you the hot failover i can show you the defusion configuration i don't have a tunnel set up on this device but i can show it to you how you do a similar kind of conflict there um yeah so it's a question from samuel santiago in case of a vpn in place do you leave the weight at 10 this weight that is defined here doesn't have any bearing on the on the um vpn on the speed fusion throughput these outbound policies are just for the things that break out um okay so jameson is asking how do outbound policies interact with the land priorities set in the main page okay so this is a very good question because at the moment i'm just going to apply this at the moment i've got a wave balancer of 10 10 10 10 so on the on the four cellular connections if i go back to the dashboard i've got all connections in priority one except for the setup let me put the other cellular ones and then we'll pretend they're active as well now what you can actually do here is if for example you had um two cellular connections that were unlimited say cellular one and cellular two are unlimited data you can use as much data as you want but it's only the three and four were a bit more measured say 10 gigabytes a month something like that what you can actually do is put them now in priority two and what that will mean is even though the weight is at 10 10 10 it's gonna use the um it's going to use the cellular one and two first and then it's going to fail over to that for this particular example you then also want to bring the v set down to priority three um but you can leave the wi-fi where and the sellers you want and priority two because the outbound policies are actually determining that you use pro the wi-fi wan first and then the cellular even though that both of these are in priority one the outbound policies are actually determining which one is used then okay um there's a question here from mike what outbound policy can help if you have a dual cellular router and want to determine the best network based on a bandwidth available so for that you will want to look at the using the outbound policy i'd use the weighted balance even if you had the weighted balance and you have one uh connection that's faster than the other uh it will actually show and will go faster if you do a speed test now in one connection with say at five million others at 50 um your speed test might only go over one of the connections but depend on the speeches because sometimes i do use multiple connections a little bit hard to tell sometimes um but yeah it's it's one of those things that sometimes best just let the router do its own thing on that you can control these with the outbound policies and all that but if you want a simple setup you can let it do its own thing as well but if you want to determine it you can go and do the tests and you can do outbound policies and test each plan individually um question here from doug um is it not the same as doing the priorities in the dashboard um it is it is similar but there are some other things that you can change in that if with doing it with the outbound policies you can also do a few other additional things like uh you can create a rule that allows um say for the crew to always use the vsat for example so if we look at the uh networks here we can see that the crew vlan is this one here so we can now go to advanced and outbound policy and we can create a rule and we can call that crew to vsat and we set the source as the ipo network of the crew the destination is any because you don't care where it's going and then you can set this to enforced and you can say okay reset's already selected there save and apply that and it's in priority one there once you apply that that means that any traffic from the crew is going to go to the vsat connection regardless of um if the connection's up or down or the priorities on the way on the dashboard as well you can also do that rule for an individual device so you could go um captain's iphone and you could put the source of the ip address or the mac address mac address is more reliable because the mac address remains the same on on all networks so i'm just going to put a random mac address in there and i've hit play so excuse me one second if you hear music because my itunes is loading because i've hit the play button instead of i was doing the ones one moment here um yeah so the destination there okay there's music let's quit that sorry if you just heard the music there and let's go with um enforce so you want to force the captain's iphone to only use the v-set or you might only want to use a cellular one or something like that um maybe kaplan's iphone is not the best you might say um it's a it's a device that's used a lot of data recently so you could say heavy user [Music] so because it's a heavy data user you can say enforce it to only use say the port wi-fi or just the v-set if the v-set was unknown to data so when once you save that um destination just be any as well or here in the destination if they're only using a lot of data to a particular domain say apple updates or something you could enter the apple um domain yeah um i don't believe this is the correct landfall of apple but you could enter the domain or the ip address or the ip subnet there and that'll mean that just there are updates and that'll go to the connection and if for this example if you use port wi-fi that means it's going to be on an unlimited connection that doesn't cost you additional to use so their update is going to happen while you're in port but not while you're at season cellular or slow vsat so again because that's for an individual device you're going to want it at the top of the list because it matches it first just for that device okay i'm going to work through some of the questions and answers kind of where it started on them anyway sean is asking what does the default https persistence rule actually do okay what the default https persistence rule does is it means that a https session that is enabled that starts and established it remains on a particular lan the reason for this is https doesn't like to be changed between different public ip addresses which is what happens when you change those ones so things like internet banking they might start giving you errors and you might even get blocked out of them if you use different ip address because they think it looks fraudulent that you're using accessing their servers from different ip addresses for the same session as such but what the https persistence rule means is that that session will be persistently using the same connection for that particular time i hope that explains that okay so um david robert asks can this approach be used to only have a particular vlan phallic cellular for example while everything else does not fail over yet you can do that so this um you've just got to think about how you structure these rules and how they fell over between them there's many different ways you can structure it and you've just got to think about the different groups the different priorities and how you want them to behave so um i think um if you explain the situation to me exactly for that of the i might understand it better um but you can have like use an enforced rule or something so that other things don't fail over uh mike anderson asked can you define outcome policy uh sorry overflow policy so if we go add rule now and we select overflow overflow can be used here as well so you can use overflow there so the overflow one is explained here uh sorry the yes so the overflow um policy is explained just here um i haven't really used this on cellular connections it's better for fixed line connections where you know the values of them but if you've got cellular connections that you kind of know what speeds they're going to be you can actually set the speeds here on the cellular now this is from the latest firmware actually i believe it might be on the beta firmware that just came out the other day uh correct me if i'm wrong but i think it might be hidden [Music] oh no here we go so yeah it's hidden here on the so this i believe it was introduced on this firmware which is uh the firmware i'm using today is 8.1.1 so beside the cellular wan connections here you can click on to configure bandwidth settings click here so you can actually define a speed here so if you know that a cellular connection never gets more than say 25 megabytes you can add that there um so that's the upload so let's go five megabytes upload and 25 download and you can actually define those there i would only use these if if you are operating in a particular area where you know that those are the kind of maximum speeds you get and if the speeds are different on the different cellular ones you've got so yeah you can do that there and you then use overflow with the with this rule um edam uh the is a possibility daily limit instead of a monthly limit apparently it's not possible um that's something that um has been asked from it uh before so i think get over to the forum and and give a quick search and i'm sure you'll find some details about that and and if you do find something in the forum that you really like the sound of a feature and you don't find it on our firmwares um you can give it a um a heart on the forum uh or even a comment and uh that's kind of what gets our engineers attention to really bring these features into the firmware so jorg asks how is it best to deal with static by peer addresses on the wand so i'm assuming you mean on like the v set here um i'm going to click on details here currently this is set up as dhcp because it's there's dhcp here it's just on my lan at home um you can change that static ppop l2tp or gre um again there's there's these more info here and also more advanced settings here um you can select routine mode in that so i'm assuming this is what you mean but dealing with static ip addresses on the wands that's where you deal with it here is by doing static address so generate the vsat connection you'd be entering that there and you'd be entering something like a slash 31 30 subnet there and the public ip address there um okay bradley asks when using a wave wi-fi or similar on the wan as a priority and the antenna loses connection to the sure wi-fi but the wand connection antenna is still connected how do i get to fail over the priority connection to that is connected okay this is a great great question and i will explain this um in more basic ways so if you have a device on the way in here say priority way in here which is the v set um let's actually go to uh wan 2 so um i'm going to enable wan2 here and we're going to call this wi-fi bridge so when to what wireless bridge sorry so for example say there's a router on the wan which is a wireless bridge to a service um it'll probably have static ip address so instead of using dhcp you put a static and you can put the ip address and it could be something like 192.168. 100.10 and the default gateway would be the ip address of the um the radio which i'm assuming would be the one so you sit at a static address so it's always there even if there's no internet you can select your upload download bandwidth etc so the interface to manage that radio i assume is what you want to do you want to be able to access that regardless if there's internet or not so what you want to do is copy that default gateway and what we can then do is we save and apply those settings okay we need dns service so now what we're going to do is train outbound policy so we'll go to advanced outbound policy and we're going to add a rule now and we'll call it wireless bridge access so the source can be any and the destination we can see it as either the ip address of that radio which is there or you can set it as the whole domain of that radio as well under ip network and then what you want to do is you want to select the algorithm as enforced and you select the wan that that wireless bridge is on so what this means is that any traffic if you type into your browser 192.168.100.1 to access that wireless bridge it's going to be enforced what over wan2 and that's even if that wan is down not connected to intent or anything so you save that and you want that as priority one at the top of this list as such and yeah that will mean any time you then go to your your browser and you type in this this um the management address of that device you'll be it'll be enforced over when to um even if the even if there's no internet you'll still be able to access it over that one i'm assuming that was the question um and um yeah if it's not quite uh let me know um but if you do want that wind fail when the connection's not there what you can actually do is you can on the health checks of it so uh as we can see at the moment it's it's there's no cable plugged into it so it's not there um but if you could set up a health check down here and you could have the health check as a ping and that could be pinging the dns servers or something else could be a dns lookup and what will happen then is if that wireless bridge is no longer connected to the internet it'll come up with failed dns check or failed health check um even when it says failed health check and it's not been used to root internet traffic over that rule will still enforce data to it for the accessing the guild so i hope that answered your question there andy is asking can you force a connection by a type of traffic for instance force netflix or itunes to use a wan we'll go to the outbound policies now we don't have um a lot of protocols there as such um and the the reason why that it's quite hard to do this by outbound policy is because um the netflix ones we have to sample them uh or we don't have to but the route has to sample it when it creates a connection and then it so it creates the first connection then we can see that it's netflix um well again not us but the router can see that it's netflix but that traffic's already established now on a land depending on your upgrade policies whereas if you've already designed an outbound policy via a protocol of say a port or a dcp you can actually catch that the outbound policies catch that before it establishes that connection and sends it to a particular connection so that's why here you can't actually define netflix or something like that um i will try to explain in a better way i'm not quite explaining it very good but i think um i do know travis has a very good way of explaining it so i might get him to explain that in a short video for everyone because it's it's a very logical way it explains why it's not so easy to direct netflix over a particular way okay i'm going to move through a few more of the questions here now okay so there's a question here from david um with the cellular as a limited resource i only want to swap out of traffic that is valued and segmented to a single vlan yep so what you can do then is you can create a rule um let's have a look at the rules i've got here now i'm going to get rid of the access to the wireless i'll leave it there actually um but the heavy user i'll get rid of now i'll just leave all the rules here so i can see what has been done um so for example say you wanted the cellular to only be used for a particular vlan you could this one here that we've got all traffic to cellular we could change that to say a guess to yes traffic to celia and then the source would be the ip network of the guests and that i believe was 190.168.51.0 i believe then it'll mean that only the guest traffic ah mr dot there that will mean that only the guest traffic is uh going over the ceiling network and any other traffic so all the other traffic will be primarily using the port wi-fi if um say the crew network or if whatever isn't uh while the crew ignore that one if that wasn't enabled um the crew traffic so let's disable it and you can disable these rules just here by clicking that and then that rule won't be in action so let's say for now the crew network the crew network would primarily use the port wi-fi if the port wi-fi failed because the vessels leave support it's going to skip this rule because it's not in that vlan and then it's going to go to the vsat so i'm assuming that's what you meant there um uh david okay next question [Music] um how to so from undress how to block ios and android os updates so this one is a bit harder to do that saying you're gonna have to look at ip addresses and things like that and it's not something that you can just do as a as a whole thing um if we go here and let me just move that out of the way if we go here now to the um qos you can actually see the applications um and you could actually um put a um the applications of um i believe amazon here so you've got amazon apple itunes things like that you can actually put them here you've also got netflix here but with these ones you can only set the priority as high normal or low there's no way to drop that traffic or anything like that and this is just curious not not actual defining what when the traffic is using um question from abby is this being recorded and will it be made we're available later yes we are recording that and it will be available later um it will be on our um on our forum yeah pop-up forum there in a few days and it will definitely be available there um sean has just posted a link in the chat there from support apple support which um has some details there and it is very in-depth about the ports and the protocols used for different things on apple devices so if you ever look through that you'd be able to use the ports and things like that to really look into what is going on and direct them to different ways on your device thanks for that sean very helpful um okay so let's have a look at some more questions um [Music] okay i'm just have a look through the chat here and see if there's any questions here as well if you got any other questions um now will be the time to ask i'm gonna also quickly jump over to the speed fusion settings and show you them now uh okay um the okay this link i'm going to share now is i'm going to send it to i'm not sure if i can let me see um i want to send it to everyone yeah let me try here and this down changes here we go okay this is a link from sean okay um let me quickly jump over the speed fusion settings and then we'll have a quick look at the antennas as well so if we go to speed fusion here there are no tunnels defined on this device but i can just uh show you the settings here though these settings here you can set the priority here in a speed fusion tunnel so this is completely independent of the outbound policies that you we were looking at before but it is dependent upon and interacts with the priority you set on the main dashboard so you can set different priorities here um you've also got a whole lot of students here so for the earlier question there was about the um when uh for the video stream um for broadcasting you've got wayne smoothing and ford error correction here so these are some things that you can use to really help you get the best out of your connection you've also got a whole lot of hidden settings here again for different things like asymmetric connection mapping cutoff latency and a whole lot of stuff generally for most people just by the default the um you you the speed fusion is going to work quite nicely but you can get in there and really play around with some of the settings to make a much better um connection for yourself um okay so the next thing we're going to have a look at here will be the um antennas so this will be the last section of the um webinar so i just received some of these um antennas the other day hang on where have my notes gone my notes i need the presented view with the notes don't i okay this is not uh i love it when you go and try and switch between the screens and it um puts the things exactly when you don't want them doesn't it okay there we go uh no we're not okay let's pause this sharing and i'll get sorted out give me two seconds and let me get this all sorted out because i'm not sure where the uh where's the slideshow gone on me now sorry guys just stand with stand by for a second here i'm just getting the uh slideshow back up i've got the notes back up but the slideshow is gone um okay ah yeah here we go so it's now in full screen that's why okay so now can you everyone see my screen there with the um puma antennas up there on the the puma 401 and the 421 okay very good got someone raise their hand perfect so we're back on now this is good so these are the puma antennas so a lot of you be familiar with our puma 401 there which is on the left um i just got to ship some a sample of the 4-2-1 the other day though these are quite a bit larger than the 401s but they do do a lot more though four cellular two wi-fi and um one gps so these will be coming out soon um yeah as you can see it is much larger but it does have the ability to connect to a lot more so this antenna has been designed for 5g 5g is something that we have got in mind we've got the routers that are 5g compatible and our antennas we are building them for 5g have a look at the gain of these antennas it's got a very nice gain across all the frequencies so even in the lower frequency there's still still 2.7 dbi again which is very good for a quite a compact antenna of this size and this data sheet will be available on the forum after when we upload the video of this webinar as well so check it out there so this product will be great for products such as our transit range the balance 310x and the mdx it will allow you to get the best daily cellular routine wi-fi wearing features with a much smaller antenna footprint so even though the antenna is bigger it'll mean that you need to use less antennas another antenna that we'll be bringing to the market very soon is the stingray there are two models in this range at the moment we've got the 201 which has two cellulars and one gps and the 401 which has four cellulars and one gps just a quick note on our numbers on our antennas the first number so for example here in this one uh the um i'm going to circle this for you so the two refers to the cellular the zero refers to wi-fi and the one here refers to the gps so i'm just going to clear all the drawings there um yeah so that's the naming and that's the same on the puma antennas and all that as well um so these are the stingray antennas um they are both antennas have actually the same antenna alignments in it but the 201 has two and four has four and it's a bit higher again these are built for 5g and these will change the game uh for maritime installs because it will mean a lot less antennas can be used to get a really nice high gain antenna installed and a compact footprint so the 401 4x4 mimo antenna there isn't anything like this for the maritime yet so this is this is something that's new to the market okay so i'm just have a um quick kind of evaluation of what a hd4 cad 18 index and still might be like on a vessel um so let's take it for example on this one you've actually got 18 16 antenna connections for cellular um with the stingray 401 you'd require four of those antennas and obviously you'd still need 16 coax cables but there's four on each one of these so you'd need four of them if you had a two by two antenna which has two antennas in it you'd need eight then which there's really a lot of antennas um you could also use four of our permafuro ones um or two of them and two of the four two ones to get the wi-fi in there as well for the wi-fi wan on the mbx um so really it's really just about reducing your footprint of the antennas on your mast but also having a really high quality signal okay so does anyone have any questions um about what we've just covered i do actually have one more comment here about our stinger antennas uh these antennas are actually because they cover all these frequencies you'll actually notice that the frequencies that are covered it also covers the wi-fi not mentioned here but you and the data sheet as mentioned it does have a very good gain for both 2.4 and 5 gigahertz wi-fi so these antennas can be used with wi-fi antennas you will just need a um a rp to sma rp sma to sma converter because these are with an sma connection so that something's really cool that you can have a nice high gain wi-fi antenna from these as well um okay so we've got a few questions coming in here so a question from jj you got two connections for antennas on cellular modems built in how do we use them how do we connect both and what are your recommendations so my recommendations are on the um [Music] on the modems you want to connect up all of the antennas so on our category 12 and below models there are two antenna connections per modem there's a main and an auxiliary if possible connect both if you only connect it to the main you might as well not have a category 12 or category 6 mode you might as well have just a category 3 mode you're not going to get very good results out of it um then once you jump up to our category 18 modems and 5g modems there's four antenna connections per modem these are um these are main and auxiliary amd so it does get a bit confusing but again to get the best out of that modem you really need to have it connected to all four um so antenna for each one you don't want to be using things like antenna combiners and things like that um if you have a look on our forum i have done some really in depth with a really in-depth four-part webinar about installing the equipment um that talks about how to install it antennas placement what to do what not to do and that covers a lot of stuff like that um so yeah for the recommendations i'd recommend fly up as possible fair view of the rise and things like that so yeah um okay we have got a few more questions here um so it don't ask can we enforce an application um come in and force an application to use specific when no you can't because that's what i was covering before about the um when an application makes its initial connection it's only after that it connects over an ip address and over a connection do do we actually see does the router actually see that it's a specific application like netflix or something like that because servers like netflix and apple they use a multitude of different ip addresses so it's very hard to create rules just on the ipads too much maintenance to keep a list of those active so andrea asks um when having slower connections is it better to bond sims or just have data between them it really depends on your situation and do you want to have a reliable connection by using speed fusion bonding so speaking bonding really can give you a really reliable connection um and can increase the speed um or do you just want to load balance between them it really depends and i'd recommend you try them all you can you can try speedfusioncloud for free with the with the free demo um and yeah that's something you can try there um bradley i'm just seeing your question there now what about wi-fi on the stingray i covered that there i must have covered that right about the same time you were asking it but yeah the stingrays do cover the wi-fi frequencies as well and are very nice for that um doug miller for the transit duo would you recommend the 401 or the 201 i would recommend um either or it depends on what the client wants um the 401 is going to give you a single antenna for both the um for the cellular and for the gps uh but two two zero ones is going to give you a symmetrical install and that's uh so you can do one on each side of the mask kind of thing so i would possibly be looking at two of the two zero ones um but if symmetricality isn't an issue i would go with the four zero one um and then you could add a two zero one for the wi-fi as well on that on the on the transit the wi-fi when so yeah it really really depends the the actual antennas on the inside are exactly the same on the 401 and the 201 so the antenna elements the same they're the same gain and everything uh just me this just doubled up on the 401 so um will we be intro so there's a question here from scott uh will we be interested in introducing an adapter to the puma tuner that will fit one inch by 14 antenna bases yes we will let me get something up for you here that you would like to see i believe this is on the forum as well but i will just bring it up we have made a very nice adapter um and the adapter we've actually designed is going to work with both the hd dome range as well as the um [Music] as well as with the puma range at the same time so i'm just trying to find the brains we've got here um i'm not sure i've got let me just see because it might be in the emails and so this is something i don't think we might have put up yet [Music] hang on i'm just searching for it now okay so this one here so i'm just gonna bring this one up so this here is what we have come up with so the sleeve on the right here the adapter 2 this one is for the puma so this one on the bottom of it here will connect to a one inch maritime standard fitting and on the top you'll be able to screw the puma straight into there if you're using it with the dome you would insert this adapter in the top here and then the dome would screw onto the top of it there as well so one these two adapters combine work with both the tumor and the hd2 dome so let me just see yeah so there we go there's a image there on the right of how they kind of combine together for both the dome adapter and the one that's for the the puma adapter there as well um that's how i work with puma just without that this little uh pinky purple one there in the middle so yes i hope that kind of answers your question there um before anyone asks the availability of those i don't know yet but if you watch the on the forum there is a topic up about that and i will probably add some more information about that soon um okay next question um question from benjamin do you have an antenna that can be used to provide internet for four to six cameras operation in a field with no direct internet access for example short that sports tournament held outside so i'm assuming do you mean like having a bass station or something that cameras can talk back too um if you want send us um an email um i will bring up her or put our socials up there now so there's all our contact details on that um if you send us an email and explain your situation we can kind of come up with a solution for that um abby the question about the recording of this yes it has been recorded and yes it'll be posted on the forum at a later date so you will be able to watch that there um okay does anyone um have any other questions i've seen a few comments come through there on the um chat there as well there's a lot of people asking about the speed fusion cloud travis did a webinar on that um a few months ago so if you want to have a look at that webinar um that if you search our forum forum sure it will be there otherwise it's on youtube um jj asked when being away from shore how far is the distance on 5g compared to 4g so 5g um you're not going to get very far away with the current 5g due to the limitations on it uh it's a it's a very short range high throughput um connection at the moment if you but the router the so our 5g devices do also cover lte so if 5g is not available they will use lte as well so you'll still get the long ranges of the lte so i hope that answers that question there but ultimately and compared to 4g the ranges will be quite small on 5g um okay so last transform here because i think that is all that we've covered for today um i don't see any more questions coming in so i am just going to give you guys a warning uh that tomorrow is april fools so do be on your awares tomorrow morning so yeah have a great weekend oh great day everyone and yeah we'll see you next webinar cheers bye"}

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "okay folks thanks for waiting let's get the show started here we've got a lot of people on the line here so thanks so much for taking the time to join us and hear about what we've got in firmware 8.1.1 as always peplink's mission continues to be delivering unbreakable connectivity anytime anywhere and so a lot of our effort and work that goes into this this firmware is really centered around that core mission so before we dive into 8-1-1 i just want to point out speed fusion cloud has been a really big part of our efforts in 2020 again furthering that mission of unbreakable connectivity anytime anywhere and we've been putting more effort into the marketing side of that and so up on our website you can you guys can go check out some new videos that we've put up there to help better explain speed fusion cloud how it works and what the benefits of it are most importantly so go check out on our website just right there at the top you can see the speed fusion cloud tab and then you can check out those videos love to get your guys's feedback on that but the topic at hand today firmware 811 right now today we are in release candidate one so we're really really close to this firmware being finalized if you haven't checked it out yet or read up on it yet you can see that on our forum just go there and search for 8.1.1 and i'm sure you'll find the the latest download links we should be hitting our release candidate 2 any day now engineering's been working tirelessly to get get this firmware finalized and out the door for for you folks to get this into production for you so go ahead kick the tires now and it should be should be a new version coming out very shortly and hopefully before the year's over we'll we'll have this finalized and release candidate but if not shortly there after the first of the year so what's in this new firmware we've got a lot of new features again speedfusioncloud's been a really big focus of us and so this is a new feature that actually wasn't in some of the earliest builds of this beta but we're trying to make it easier and easier for folks with or without ite experience to optimize and protect cloud applications so obviously in 2020 everybody's been doing zoom microsoft teams google meet we've all been using these online collaboration platforms and we've all been having all kinds of problems with them and our connectivity being one of them so with the latest version of speed fusion cloud and the latest version of this firmware we are making it even easier to select the applications that are important to you and give you just a really simple way to make sure that those applications get optimized and prioritized and you're not wasting bandwidth protecting applications that aren't critical to you so we'll walk through that and show you how that works in a little bit some other key features in 8-1-1 we've got wi-fi mesh support this has been something that's been asked about it for years and the really cool thing is this is supported on a lot of our new routers that have 11 ac wi-fi and it's also supported on our wi-fi access points that support 802.11 ac wi-fi or newer and so we'll show you more about how this integration works but it's a great way to take an existing peplink if you've got a balanced 20x or a surf soho mark iii again any any peplink router that has that 11ac wi-fi built into it all you need to do is buy one more peplink access point and you can create your own mesh network to wirelessly extend the coverage of that of that existing router if you've got a pep link router that doesn't have built-in wi-fi that's okay that that router can still manage the mesh profiles for any number of other pep link wi-fi access points so you can still use that non-wi-fi enabled peplink router as the core of your mesh network and then again using use additional pep link access points to to create that mesh wi-fi coverage and of course we'll show you we'll dive into that at the end of this presentation and show you how that works last but not least we've got open vpn client mode this is one of those features that's really important to certain people and other people it's not a not a big deal for but for those of you that use openvpn uh we see a lot of people using it with the different privacy vpn services out there a lot of those offer open vpn support so that you can connect your router directly to one of those those again privacy vpn services and a lot of companies just operate open vpn servers as well for remote employees or or for remote networks that they have so regardless if you're a user of openvpn you can now use openvpn client mode this is a separate license but it's officially enabled in firmware 8.1.1 some other features that i want to show you or just at least highlight here to make you aware of that are also enabled on 8-1-1 these aren't quite as major as the other ones i've showed you but again these are the types of features that if they're important to you they're a really big deal first up is supporting dscp so dscp is a type of packet header or metadata about different packets that different applications will tag their traffic with so real-time applications voice over ip applications applications that either need priority or or some other type of special treatment we now support firewalling based on the dscp values so you can really quickly block uh or identify tr or allow traffic that that's tagged with the specific dscp value that you're you're specifying and you can also use outbound policies with dscp values so again you can carve out policies that make it really easy to identify traffic that's important to you either to prioritize or optimize or block so just one more way that you can identify traffic now a second popular one is wan poe so our flex module our flex module plus uh add-ons for like our sdx or our epx there's an eight-port ethernet module that comes with that and that sports poe on it and more and more and more we're seeing people wanting to use those to have wan devices either hanging hd1 domes off of it or some other sort of way on device in any case 811 allows you to make those flex module plus ethernet ports capable of being used as a wham another big one to point out our apis as always continue to grow continue to improve and so there's a lot more settings and features that are now accessible through either our device local api or our in control cloud api so if you haven't used those go check them out our website has the the support documents for each of those again really full full featured apis there and we've had customers build really really cool user interfaces using these apis and so again the power of this is really being able to use that local api for making making it calls directly to your router and then using in control as well to either relay those local api calls or using the in control api directly as well last but not least here we've got the flex module mini this is the the slot that's used in the balance 20x the and the newly launched 380x and 580x so with this module you can now plug a dsl connection directly into your router you don't need a modem in between so dsl is more and less popular depending on the country or state that you live in so for some dsl is not really big news but for others it's a really big deal so we have now added a flex module mini module that's capable of supporting bdsl two other features to throw at you here we've got netflow this this isn't a new feature but we've expanded the capabilities of our netflow integration again it's one of those features if you don't know what it is you don't have to worry about it too much or get get too excited about it but if you do know what it is it's probably something you use every day and it's a very critical feature for you and so we've added the ability to utilize uh two netflow servers or receivers uh in this latest firmware and we've got a few other fine-tuned elements for you to better optimize your netflow integration another really cool feature that we announced is our air monitor support this is something if you've used our air probe feature our air probe product in the past you've utilized this to scan the wi-fi environment in your area so you can use this as a spectrum analyzer and a tool to really get a better view of what the overall rf environment is in any given location so we've expanded this to all of our routers again that have built in wi-fi and all of our access points as well and so we'll show you what this looks like and the great reports that in control 2 kicks out when you turn this feature on so we talked about the ap firmware or the the router firmware but we need to talk about the ap firmware as well like we said there's mesh wi-fi support and there's this air monitor support these are both features that are coming out in this new ap1 firmware and so depending on the generation of your product whether it's 11ac 11ac wave 2 or our newest wi-fi 6 access points we have firmware to support all these great new features that pair up with our routers so again this new wi-fi access point firmware gives you that mesh support so you can use these to wirelessly extend your network support so you can get nice reporting from your devices about which applications are being used by which clients and so this is really cool for areas where maybe you've put a pep link out there in a large scale hotspot and it's not really a pep link router you've put a peplink access point to support a large scale distributed wi-fi hotspot you know maybe you're putting these in coffee shops or restaurants or any number of locations that you may not have control over the overall infrastructure but just using a single pep link access point you can get the the dpi support built into that access point instead of needing a larger router to support that capability so if you give me just a second here i will pull up some of my screens here and we'll start diving into some of these features and show you real time how they work and we'll hold q a for after that just one second folks okay with any luck you are seeing the dashboard of my peplink ubr go so we've got a couple connections here in play we've got our wired wand we've got our cellular on verizon and our cellular on a tnt and then you can see we've got a speed fusion cloud connection down here to chicago we are going to go to the speed fusion cloud tab and again really big feature here is we've got this optimized cloud application button here that's shown up so this is of course new in in previous webinars we've talked about the overall speedfusion cloud setup about choosing your location connecting individual clients to the cloud or connecting a wi-fi ssid to the cloud and those are great right those are easy you know button click types of ways to get either an individual client or an entire ssid sent over to the cloud so you can protect it any way you want but the problem with that depending on the device and depending on what what you're doing on that device is you all of those things on that device or on that ssid might not be mission critical and so then you're sending additional traffic to the cloud that maybe doesn't need that protection or doesn't need to need to be routed that way and so this new button here optimized cloud application allows us to just inspect the traffic coming from all different places and pick out the just important applications that are a priority to users so that way you don't have to create these other policies you can just again select those single applications or services that are most important to you and it doesn't matter if you're plugged in over ethernet or wi-fi wi-fi or if you switch from your your iphone to your to your laptop will pick those applications out regardless of device or ssid so all you have to do in my in my example here i've got a tunnel to chicago connected and i've selected zoom as one application but you can see from the list here we'll just blow that out of there we've got just a few different applications to start with we've got google workspace office 365 so this covers uh teams and and skype for business and then we've got zoom life size and salesforce so of course zoom's a big deal of course office 365 and teams is a big deal and for me google workspace is a daily driver as well so if we save that apply those changes if we come over here to the status tab we'll check our speed fusion status quick you can see we're connected to speed fusion cloud we've got all kinds of traffic flowing things are good if we check out our active sessions let's just take a look and see where all this traffic is going so you can see google zoom all kinds of these applications that we just picked out are going to the speedfusion cloud there's probably a few applications that aren't switched over yet because we just updated this policy so there might be a few applications that haven't hit this policy yet but again that's all i needed to do i don't have to do any outbound policies i don't have to do any extra ssid configuration no extra settings to make that work so you can really easily carve out those those applications that are priority to you and again this isn't a final list right this is this is where we're starting we found the hot button applications right away and so absolutely reach out on the forum reach out however you wish to to request other applications that are a priority to add to this list this is something that we've got capability to keep updating and growing so again please share your thoughts on that all right i'm going to pause for just a second and pull up some more demos for you here okay folks you should be seeing the dashboard of a balanced 20x if that's not what you're seeing shout at me in the q a all right no news is good news we're going to keep moving so this is the balance 20x we're going to show you the wi-fi mesh capabilities the balance 20x if you're not familiar with it is an awesome value this is a 399 router that includes a built-in uh cellular connection so here you can see we've got an ethernet wan and a cellular win it's also got this flex mini slot labeled number two here which in this case is not being used but it's got the capability to add a second radio to it so awesome product for 3.99 but we're going to show you how you can use this product to build a mesh network over wi-fi so if we click over to the ap tab i've set up a few different things in here already but we'll just walk through this i've set up an ssid it's labeled webinar mesh this itself isn't specifically the mesh network this is just the ssid that anybody would connect to so we set this up just like any other ssid we would normally do nothing special there then the next tab down here is the new one we've got a wireless mesh tab and so this is where you create your wireless mesh profile so if we open this up you create a mesh id and you select the frequency you want to message on and you select the shared key so really simple the mesh id and the shared key need to match on all of your devices as does the frequency so you've got three settings that you have to be concerned about to get your mesh network up and running for me personally i would pretty much always choose to mesh on five gigahertz there's a lot more spectrum available for wi-fi in that band versus 2.4 so it's just going to give you a little better performance in general if you know what you're doing and you want to choose 2.4 go for it feel free to try both see what works well but again there's just a lot more room for for traffic on five gigahertz so you probably will have a better experience there nonetheless get that get that set up make sure you've got those three fields written down so that you can take it to your other devices depending on your model and depending on the access point controller capabilities of your model you may have to take this third step to get the mesh up and running in my case on the 20x you do so you have to come under the settings and then the access point profile and you have to enable the mesh profile that you just created if you don't have that enabled you'll get a dead giveaway on this wireless mesh tab this frequency will be grayed out indicating that it's not actively being used so if you set this up and you see that grayed out that's your cue to come check out the settings tab and then look at your access point profile and make sure that it's enabled and of course saved there so once you've done that if you've ever used our access point controller you can use it to push these settings to other access points so let's say you have 10 access points that you want to get set up in some sort of a mash configuration you could log into each one of those and the access points each have these wireless mesh settings i can show you that quickly here on another unit if i remember the password i don't think i do nonetheless we can get that quickly this is another nice feature of our access point controller we standardize all the logins and all that fun stuff so that you don't have access points hanging out there with default passwords and those things so ap controller is one nice way to manage that cover your butt from other problems there so this unit looks a little bit different on the dashboard it's almost contradictory here we've got the wan which has an ip address but it says it's disconnected so what the heck well this unit's matched wirelessly right now so it does have an ip address but that lan port is disconnected so it looks incorrect or strange but that's this unit is in mesh mode already if i come under the ap just like we saw in the router there's a section called mesh and so this is real similar the only difference is you've got this enable disable box whereas on the router you had the profile that you had to go enable this this mesh setting in in here it's just one one extra setting but it's all on the same screen so again make sure these match once you've got that set up you're good to go so again you could log into each of these access points set that mesh setting up manually or if you're into automation you can plug each of these access points into your router that has the mesh profile and the access point controller feature turned on and give it about five or ten minutes and they'll sync it up and they'll they'll take that mesh profile and then you can unplug it and go power it up somewhere wirelessly and it will seek out that mesh network and be ready to deploy so you've got a couple different ways to speed up that deployment if if you're trying to do this on more than one unit now we also support wds wds is really a legacy type of configuration it's a it's like a static mesh you can achieve wireless extension of coverage but you have to uniquely program every single link in the chain and it's not dynamic not flexible so it's really cumbersome from a maintenance standpoint to to do wds so mesh achieves the same benefits but automates all those connections again with those three shared settings so much easier to to implement if we look at the access point status tab here you can see the master wds info and you can see the transmit receive rate how much traffic gets pushed over that mesh just real simple just like a just like a wi-fi client if we come back to the router we can check the mesh status as well this is under the ap tab here and we get this nice little simple topology graph you can see we've got our wi-fi mesh that's the name of this router that's that's your base in blue and then you've got this little wireless link over here to this red dot this is our matched access point that we were just logged into so you can see the duration uptime and again the the overall transmit receive rates so really straightforward really really powerful functionality though again any any pep link router or access point that has 11 ac wi-fi or newer will support this feature and they're interoperable so if you've got an ac router with a wave 2 access point those can play nice together and form this mesh network again this requires the access point and the router firmware to be on the latest versions that we're talking about here so again go to the form and check for those different firmware versions again on the access point there's three different versions depending on your your hardware generation again three six two is for the eleven ac three seven three is for eleven ac wave two and three eight one is for our newest wi-fi six access points all right i'm gonna pause again and we'll pull up some more demos okay we're back next up we're gonna show you dscp in the firewall and the outbound policy this one is pretty straightforward but even myself i needed to be shown where it was to to really use it and so i'll return the favor to you as well if we go to the outbound policy first we can try this destination sorry if we look under protocol there it is dscp so you've got a whole bunch of different predefined dscp values you can choose the one appropriate for your application that you're trying to either control the policy outbound policy on or again fire wallet so you can do a priority rule make sure it's using the wan first or make sure it's using speed fusion cloud first depending on what you're trying to do here you've got a lot of flexibility built in to the built on top of the the outbound policy ruled that rule builder here if we go under the firewall just for those of you that don't know there's two sections under our firewall we've got our access rules that's the stateful firewall so the layer two through four and then we've got content blocking that's our layer seven firewalling capabilities so you've got all kinds of dpi blocking capabilities all kinds of content url type categories you can block there but the dsap stuff is under that stateful firewall section so under the inbound firewall we can just add a rule again look under protocol you can find the dscp section there and again you've got the same predefined dscp values that you can choose and then you can allow or deny those depending on again what you're trying to do okay next up netflow this one's a little hidden and rightfully so this is usually something either large enterprises or large service providers are using um it's not generally an end user facing feature but for those of you that don't know we're telling secrets here we've got our support cgi page this is kind of a landing place for less customer facing features or new features and you can see under here we've got netflow it's real simple just enable it again so in this ver firmware version we supported we supported netflow previously but now we've added the second netflow server so if you've got multiple netflow servers you can now speak to two you can choose the different netflow version up there and then we've added some timers for flow timeouts and those kinds of things so you've got just a few more knobs and dials to really tweak your net flow settings and get that working the way you want not much else to show there but again if you're using it this will make a ton of sense to you and if you're not no worries another one that's kind of tucked away on the support cgi page is our air monitor so you can see it just below here again it's a real simple check box just enable it click save okay we got to go to the dashboard and apply those changes if you're on this page it's kind of like how do i get back to the dashboard so under this lan when ethernet settings click to show and then there's a quick link to the dashboard there you can always use the back button too but in any case you can see we've got changes pending so let's apply that now i already had this turned on earlier today so i don't need to wait too long for this to apply but i will pull up the ic2 side of this and show you what this air monitor capability enables so let's go back to the dashboard first so this is our this is our balance 20x that we've been using for this demo with the mesh and now the air monitor support if we look under reports at the device level you can see this air probe reports air monitor so when you turn this on it scans the spectrum constantly in the background so it's always keeping tabs on that and so you can go to any point in time and retrieve the rf environment's properties at that given time so this is a great tool for remote support especially so if you've got a large wi-fi deployment with lots of users and they're bringing their own devices and there's all kinds of variability there it's really hard to trace down problem reports right this person or that person will say yeah i had issues at this time or that time and you just really don't have a lot to go on unless it's like a complete access point being down or something like that right if you exhaust the obvious problems you kind of run out of run out of tools to to keep trouble shooting with and so this gives you that next step if if the obvious problems aren't the source of your issue you can come in here and go to again whatever time that that user is reporting an issue retrieve that spectrum information so you can see there's some on this particular channel we've got some really heavy utilization from time to time you can see overall average utilization of the channels you can see how many devices there are access point being an access point or a wi-fi router station being a client device a phone a tablet a pc and then there's other devices right someone sometimes there's non-80211 devices on on these channels as well so going into this air monitor mode gives you a lot more visibility than uh what like a wi-fi scanning program might give you on your laptop then you can see the overall access point distribution you can see we've got a lot of people using 80 megahertz channels here so like i was talking about earlier on the mesh conversation there's a lot bigger channels and more spectrum in general and 5 gigahertz so that's where you see a lot of people using it so you these really big wide ones that cover up this whole area those are maxing out all the spectrum in that area so you've got a lot more bandwidth on those on those really big channels as opposed to these smaller 40 megahertz or even 20 megahertz channels so again you can just get a better better view of what what you're competing against what you're fighting against in the in the rf space that you can't normally see with your own eyes so that covers most of the demo for today i'm going to just pull up the questions here i think there's quite a few that have ticked in over the webinar so i will just start from the top and answer as many as i can first up will the wi-fi mesh support be supported in the ap1 enterprise aps yes those are 11 ac capable so the answer is yes they get mesh will the air monitor support be used with the local ap yeah that can be used on oh local api i misread that one i'm not sure on that question what will the air monitor be accessible through the api um not sure totally possible but that's a good follow-up i see a question for oracle cloud on the new speedfusion cloud application prioritization we can definitely add that to our list i see a question about the vdsl are we going to add that to more models or is it only in the flex module my understanding is it's currently only in the flex module i'm not vdsl is just not a common access last mile access technology in the us i just frankly haven't invested a lot of time in really understanding what other vdsl capabilities we have there chris so that's another good one for follow-up i see a question hopefully it was answered earlier but can mesh can can aps mesh with pep wave routers with integrated wi-fi 2 or just other pep wave aps the answer is yes to that question so long as that pep wave router has 11 ac wi-fi in it or better so again the the soho mark 3 the balance 20x those are good examples of pepwave or peplink routers that have integrated wi-fi that do support the mesh feature uh br1 mini would be an example of a product that does not support the mesh feature that's just 11n on the br1 mini another good one to point out on routers that support meshes the transit duo that's got the 11 ac wi-fi in it as well so another good choice for for wi-fi mesh another question does choosing mesh frequency disable clients from connecting on that frequency in our implementation no sometimes vendors do that um we allow one radio to simultaneously serve both purposes so again it might be a little bit counter-intuitive to use the same radio for both versus one for clients and one for for meshing but again with just the overall much larger spectrum on five gigahertz that's usually gonna net a better result regardless but you know if you mesh on five gigahertz you can definitely only allow clients to connect on 2.4 but it's really your choice to allow that to share both purposes or not and meshing with ssids the ssid side is really not directly related to the mesh the mesh is just your backbone to that access point so each access point can have different ssids on it if you want or if you use the controller to manage that or just manually program it they can all have the same ssid and they'll be excuse me they'll behave just like a wired access point would if users roam from one to the other seen another question can an ap connected over mesh have wired clients plugged into it and be able to access various networks um i've done it in a real simple test i've had a device plugged into the ethernet port of a wirelessly meshed access point and i've been able to pass the untagged vlan through i believe it's a true layer 2 connection so vlan tags should pass as well for other ssids i just can't say that i've personally tested that out yet but you should have that capability as well so question on when these will be when these firmwares will be released the access point firmware is live now and the the router firmware is in release candidate one stage so we're talking just a couple of weeks before that's that's officially ga but regardless you can get all this firmware right now on the on the forum in the beta or release candidate state another question about air monitor when that's enabled the wi-fi interface is dedicated for that that's correct yeah that will disable your access point functionality when you turn on air monitor support so it's a great tool but you need to be aware of that if if you only have one access point there it's not going to be good to use in during production hours it will disconnect a client so usually you would use that if you've got multiple access points and you know you can use one to to dedicate for that that functionality but if you've got again a busy remote location that you don't want to drive out to a lot that's a great great way to extend your your toolbox from from remote see a question about wi-fi mesh and using like an all-in-one antenna for cellular and gps so a lot of people use for obvious reasons the all-in-one style antennas like our puma 401 or puma 4-2 or 2-2-1 so that they can get one single an antenna punched through a wall punch through a ceiling something like that um not have to have a whole bunch of different punches through whatever whatever surface they're mounting to and so you know if you're putting your it really just depends on where your other mesh wi-fi access points are if if you're running that that all-in-one antenna outside then you've got all your wi-fi antennas outside and and up you know somewhere conceivably and so if you're meshing to other devices that are outside to other buildings things like that that would work great if you're trying to mesh to other things that are inside the building then you know you're just going to have much less signal in that situation so then you would want to look at maybe splitting that all in one into maybe using the paddle antennas for the wi-fi and only using cellular and gps on the exterior but just lots to consider there in terms of antenna configurations when you're trying to combine mesh and cellular wi-fi and cellular into the same antenna it's really just all about placement at the end of it i see a question what benefit is mesh if you have all of your access points wired there is no benefit frankly unless you're going to need to make one of those access points wireless so that that really is the rule of mesh that is absolutely my policy if you can run ethernet to it without headache and and you expect it to run all day every day 24 7 with lots of users i would wire it mesh is great mesh gives you tons of flexibility and it helps you solve those problems that you can't solve with a wire but if you can get a wire there do it it will work better long term for you there's just so many variables in wireless that plugging it in over ethernet is always the better choice if that's a practical one see a question just about the ap controller what happens if that fails or is disconnected the ap still work yeah the aps don't require a persistent connection to the controller obviously if the controller is your router and it loses connectivity there there might be bigger issues with your router but fundamentally the access points don't need that to keep operating they receive their configuration and kind of run autonomously while still reporting back and sending client data to the controller so there's not a critical need for that ap controller to stay there again just the fact that it's integrated into your router may might make it it might make it required in one way or another can you mesh with non public aps that support 802.11s and 802.11 ac i have no idea mark i apologize but not tried it um it's possible but i wouldn't i wouldn't put money on it and frankly i wouldn't do it in any production environment but if it's something in your home or somewhere that really doesn't matter give it a shot and let us know i'm not sure either way on that one see another question is openvpn conceptually similar to speed fusion and how it works with respect to outbound policy firewall yes it's similar it's just another destination in this in this example and i just want to be clear we've supported openvpn as a server on the router for a while so that you can use it you've been able to use a pep link to allow open vpn clients to connect to it this new feature and add-on license in eight one one is allowing the peplink device to connect to another openvpn server as a client on that one but yes conceptually the question you asked is is very similar i see some questions about that openvpn and different services like expressvpn i personally am not an active user of those services so i really can't speak to those specific integration questions i would take those questions to the forum see how far you can get and post your results up on there for you know there's expressvpn nordvpn there's lots of different vpn services out there so i expect there will be quirks and kind of different different aspects to each of those that might be needed to make them work but yeah i think that's best done on the community forum more people with experience on either any of those platforms can chime in i see another question about a specific bug fix an 8-1-1 if it's there not regarding access point for more packs i don't know that would be if you don't see it again ask it on the the 8-1-1 forum thread the the thread with that form download link i would ask the question there and i think that's probably the best place to get that answer on a really specific bug fix that you're looking for i see a question on the price for that open vpn license i believe that's a 99 add-on one-time add-on for each product or each router i haven't looked at the price list today so i'm not a hundred percent sure on that but i'm pretty sure it's 99 bucks to add it to whichever router you want it on and again that's a it's a one-time license not a recurring all right folks we're going to wrap it there give you eight minutes back thanks so much for attending and take care"}

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "background on 5g give you some technology overview hopefully we can teach you a few different things about the technology in general and then again we'll show you how we're using it and what what products you can expect to see shortly with 5g capabilities so first and foremost peplink's core mission is to deliver unbreakable connectivity anytime anywhere and that mission really isn't changing with the onset of 5g that is still super relevant and we'll talk a little bit about that as we go through this but again peplink's core mission is delivering unbreakable connectivity no matter 5g 4g 3g wireline wireless that is our absolute mission and we feel like we do a pretty good job at it but you know it's not really important what we think what's most important is what our customers think so we've been covered by gartner's research for the last three years in their wenedge infrastructure category and that's great we're very proud of that but again we're most proud of what our customers are saying about our products and so gartner in parallel operates their peer insights page and so any gartner customer any pep link customer any customer using a vendor that gartner covers is allowed to come to this site register and put a review put a testimonial up about their experience with the particular product and bender and so i really am most proud of this we have excellent ratings on here our our ratings far outshine a lot of our competition and so this i think is really the biggest testament to what we're able to do in terms of delivering on that mission of unbreakable connectivity so what are we seeing out there in terms of 5g anybody who's got eyeballs and ears can tell 5g is happening right there's phones there's ads there's all kinds of talk and buzz about 5g and i think a lot of us have seen some form of a 5g deployment showing up in their area if not recently very soon on the way but up until now the the device availability just hasn't really been that widespread it's been limited to hot spots and phones and so we haven't really seen that wave of adoption yet in 5g it's really just kind of at the beginning still one question we keep getting is won't 5g eliminate the need for speed fusion 5g is fast right that's the whole promise 5g is going to be really fast and so speed fusion why would i need that if i've got this super fast 5g well if you've looked at the wireless networks over the years it's kind of the same story over and over again right 3g came out and it's 10 times faster than 2g was and wow what are we going to do with all this speed how are we going to use all this same story with 4g 100 megabits over wireless wow we you know it's going to take forever to to saturate that and so you know 5g we're talking about gigabit speeds but there's all kinds of new applications that are pent up and and ready to be used on these these much faster networks and so i don't think this is going to be dramatically different than than the previous generations have we're we're good at consuming bandwidth right we're great at it we've demonstrated that over and over again so i think you're still going to see some of those same challenges develop as people get more and more adjusted to utilizing the capabilities of 5g the other reason speedfusion is still super relevant with 5g is this is a major transition it's going to take the carriers a long time to fully develop and deploy 5g in a consistent manner so that consistency is going to take time just geographically they have to build all this out and so you're going to see a lot of variations in performance from one area to the next as 5g does roll out and so those variations in performance are going to drive a need for more control over that experience so the great news here is speedfusion is 5g ready speedfusion was never designed around one single technology or one single wireless generation it was always designed to be an adaptable flexible technology to incorporate different lands of different technologies and use those in in more intelligent ways so we've been doing a lot of pilot projects with customers and carriers and working on ways that we can make speed fusion more relevant and more useful in the 5g world so some other things that we're seeing out in the market right now customers are getting really comfortable with lte and or 5g as a primary wan more and more businesses are valuing the agility that comes with those wireless connections right before covet even even still retail operations were moving much more to a pop-up type of model where they would be in brick-and-mortar stores but maybe only for a short period of time maybe six twelve months and so the needs of businesses have shifted a lot and so the the the capabilities of wireless lands are really matching up really well with those needs now but of course there's always going to be little problems more and more people are aware of apple application performance shortcomings you know work from home all the all the zoom meetings teams meetings that we're doing now kind of highlight these inconsistencies in wireless networks right you might get a good speed test result you might get 20 30 50 100 megs on your speed test but somehow you're still getting kind of garbly audio and video on your zoom call so what's going on right it's just not quite matching up with what people are expecting the other thing that we're seeing a lot of is especially in the enterprise companies are avoiding managing infrastructure themselves they're they're really i think tired of investing and building networks out themselves and they're much more interested in building applications and software solutions for themselves and so more and more we're seeing what's winning out there right now is customers and partners that are able to deliver turnkey fast deploy solutions so being being able to provide connectivity as a service smart unbreakable connectivity as a service is really an area we're seeing a ton of growth in now so what's the current status i mean if you watch the news if you watch the ads we've got 5g it's like wireless fiber everywhere right you can you can do robotic surgery from your couch and you can have a self-driving vehicle that's gonna take you from here to there and bring you home the possibilities are endless right and and i don't mean to make fun of it right these are real possibilities but the reality is that's not probably the experience that's possible today and so what's the difference between people's expectations and the reality out there right now i think a lot of people expect 5g super fast right that's what the ads are saying and so let's flip that switch i've got 5g in my city i want to see that hair bending gigabit 10 gigabit speed and for most of us that's really not going to be the experience that we see today instead of a switch i think the the 5g deployment is a lot more like a dimmer it's not on or off it's how bright is it right now how far along is it so right away probably a year or two ago we started to see really limited pilot projects rolling out a couple cities got a couple deployments and there were a couple early devices that supported 5g now as those pilots gained traction and proved to be successful those cities expanded we started to see some of the flagship android devices fully support 5g so we started to get a little bit more maturity right it's a little bit more real for people now just a month or so ago apple came out with the iphone 12 and that supports 5g so now we've got basically all of the the flagship and more run-of-the-mill consumer devices supporting 5g however that adoption wave hasn't hit yet the reality is almost everybody on these carrier networks still only has a 4g device so we've got devices we've got network but again that that adoption wave hasn't really hit yet we're just kind of starting that that process where you're going to start to see consumers actually migrating to devices that support 5g and in large numbers so the dimmer's not all the way on yet right we're maybe we'll call it halfway there and so let's look let's look forward to 2021. we're just approaching the end of of 2020 and there's been a lot of news lately about routers and things like that supporting 5g but the reality is those aren't certified yet the carriers have not certified 5g modules and so in turn routers are not certified for these carrier networks yet so that's really really what we're going to start to see in 2021 we're going to start to see these modules get carrier approval and then in turn we'll start to see routers and iot type devices also get approved for these 5g networks also in 2021 again you'll start to see that shift of the the consumer devices again right now pretty much everybody still has a 4g only device so in 2021 we'll start to see that shift dramatically again these devices are available now you'll start to see pretty massive adoption of 5g devices and so you'll start to see the carriers shift their spectrum resources much more heavily into 5g i think that's a little detail that a lot of people may not be aware of as the carriers are rolling these networks out they've got frequencies that they can use in 4g and frequencies that they can use in 5g and they can kind of share them sometimes too between those two networks but currently they haven't really deployed or thrown their full spectrum resources at the 5g networks yet again because there's just not a lot of people with devices capable of using them so you'll start to see 5g get a lot faster in 2021 because again they'll shift spectrum resources as people join on with with 5g capable devices 2021 and 2022 you'll start to see mid-band 5g spectrum get deployed so you'll see an even greater speed boost in 5g as those frequencies are deployed we'll talk about these frequencies in a little bit here and then last but not least is the millimeter wave deployments those are already happening there's probably 30 or 40 cities across the us covered by the different carriers with some degree of millimeter wave coverage but these are realistically pretty small deployments right now they're block by block type of urban core coverage areas right now and so in the 2021 2022 you'll start to see that millimeter wave take shape more and more and really start to enable those super fast gigabit multi gigabit speeds that we've all been looking for and waiting for so let's just talk about how this works how 4g is different than 5g and what really what makes 5g so much faster and the short answer is there's no single answer to that question there's a lot of different things in play that together add up to 5g technologies promise and capabilities on the far left we've got the spectrum so at the top you can see basically today's current swath of lte spectrum it's kind of centered around a little bit below one gigahertz to a little bit above three gigahertz 5g has opened up a lot of spectrum so there's just a lot more frequencies that can be used to deliver wireless services to to customers and so we're seeing that shift happen now we're starting to see the 4g spectrum gradually shift into 5g use and we're starting to see these these new frequency bands start to come come alive and be utilized on top of the the existing bands that were already in use so there's really three bands that people talk about there's millimeter wave this is super high frequency super high speed this is where you get that gigabit multi gigabit type of capacity but it's very short range it's very easily obstructed by trees walls those kinds of things so you know it's not really a mobility type of uh frequency at this point they it's going to take really really widespread deployment before the millimeter wave frequency is a realistic technology for mobility applications for the most part you'll see millimeter wave used in fixed type of applications to start with or you'll see you know stadiums and things like that where there's really high user densities that need all that capacity in one short little area so millimeter wave is that high frequency high speed but again it's going to take a long time to deploy that in a in a really ubiquitous manner now sub six that's below six gigahertz that's kind of uh usually there's two bands there that are kind of lumped into that sub six conversation and i think the main reason is because the sub six frequencies behave a lot like lte networks do today you've got basically the same antennas really similar technologies really similar ways to deploy it the compared to the traditional lte networks but that sub six kind of mid-band slice there's still a lot of new spectrum there it again it behaves pretty similar to existing lte networks so it's that's an area where again you'll start to see a lot of early gains in the speed as those mid bands come online it's just giving you more channels to talk out on that 5g network with now that sub 6 that sub 1 gigahertz low band those are what carriers often call coverage bands those are the the bands that can reach really far in rural areas and penetrate deep into buildings so 5g on these spec on this spectrum is great because again it provides you that wide coverage but it's really kind of an incremental improvement in terms of speed those low frequencies there's not a ton more you can do with them so there's technologies here in the middle to make those that spectrum more efficient you've got massive mimo so you've got four by four or even more mimo so you can hear a little bit farther you can talk a little bit farther and you get a little bit more cleaner usage of the airtime but again that's an incremental game beam forming is kind of part of that that again helps the antennas just talk more efficiently back and forth to each other and focus their energy at the tower at the client which yields better data rates but again that's a more of an incremental improvement in speed versus a game changer and there's some underlying technology that just makes the encoding and kind of the technical ways that these towers and devices talk to each other a little bit more efficient as well 5g is also a lot more efficient and flexible so you can have really big channels and really small channels so you can have really small channels for iot devices and kind of keep them segregated give them much longer range but not kind of crowd the higher capacity higher throughput bands for other devices so carriers are going to have a lot more flexibility and control over how how they chop this spectrum up and how they utilize it another big attribute of the 5g networks again especially with millimeter wave networks is densification those millimeter waves are you know city block level coverage it's not you know hundreds of feet you know it's not it's hundreds of feet it's not thousands of feet or miles or it's much smaller footprint so there's a lot more nodes required to provide that kind of ground level coverage so you'll see oftentimes you'll see the carriers activate 5g again on their lower frequencies right away so they don't have to deploy new towers necessarily to do that they might have to tweak something at this tower or that tower to turn that on but relatively light lift in terms of effort required to turn that on compared to getting bucket trucks out there and hanging poles on street lights all over all over your city blocks to get that that super high speed millimeter wave deployed so how can we use speed fusion with 5g what are some useful ways that this these two technologies can fit together first up bandwidth bonding so 5g is going to be a faster connection that's kind of the the underlying promise there and again really the reality in a lot of scenarios comparing the same same situation from 4g to 5g 5g is generally going to be faster every time but again as these networks roll out you're going to have very wide variations in the performance you're able to get you know if you're in the urban core you might see those gigabit speeds or maybe several hundred megabits as you move out to the the more uh suburban areas and then as you get into the rural areas oftentimes you'll still see 5g performance maybe in that 20 30 40 megabit per second range so that sounds kind of like 4g speeds right and again those low frequency bands on 5g are really more of an incremental improvement they're not game changer type of speeds yet so as you you know especially mobility applications as you're moving in and out of these areas you're going to have widely varying capabilities from those lte networks so that ability to do packet level bonding and aggregating throughput is still going to be really important especially in mobility applications now when we talk about hot failover again as you're moving between these networks and jumping up and down that ladder of capability and speeds you're going to have dead spots too right 5g does not just eliminate dead spots magically the carriers still have to put in a ton of effort and and resources to cover all these areas efficiently and so there's still going to be gaps right one network is still going to be stronger here than the other network is and so being able to seamlessly hand off between those networks is still going to be super relevant again especially in mobility applications now if we look at fixed applications you might be able to use a much faster more consistent 5g connection in a fixed location right you might be able to get access to that millimeter wave or just maintain really high speed you know 100 megabit plus type of connectivity so in those situations you might want to use 5g as a primary one or you might want to use it as a backup to like a high quality landline right backing up a high quality landline if you've got like a gigabit connection and rolling that over to maybe a 10 or 20 megabit lte connection that's not going to give you a great experience right if you've got 50 100 users on that wireline connection that single lte connection really isn't going to give them that same experience it's not really a useful failover in a lot of situations so being able to switch over from a high speed wire line to a high speed 5g that's still super useful right you can match that experience of that wire line connection and give you that seamless failover between the two two other speed fusion technologies we can talk about with 5g are wan smoothing and bandwidth overflow so when smoothing the whole point of when smoothing is to optimize the performance of real-time applications when smoothing is not targeted at peak throughput again your zoom call your team's call they don't care if you've got a gigabit connection they need like one megabit really consistently they need super low packet loss they need super low latency again it's all about the consistency that makes those real-time applications perform well so when smoothing you can do that you can optimize that you can make sure that you've got the most consistent usage on every single packet that goes out so that you can adjust to those variations in one link or another again 5g networks are going to have ton of capacity but there's still going to be little interruptions right the latency is going to be super low overall on these 5g networks but there's still going to be little little performance hiccups here and there as people do heavier and heavier applications on them so you're still going to see that need for protecting those real-time applications now bandwidth overflow is something we haven't talked a lot about publicly yet but this is a really great fit for for 5g and especially fixed location type applications oftentimes fixed location they already have some sort of wired connectivity and that's usually an unmetered kind of unlimited type of type of connection but oftentimes they've kind of maxed that out right if it's a dsl connection or a cable connection it's got its limits right maybe you've got a 50 meg dsl connection that does pretty well for the most part right you can do pretty much everything you need to but more and more as we're doing more and more zoom calls more and more online applications maybe that 50 meg just is kind of getting maxed out well with speed fusion bandwidth overflow you can still use that wire line circuit as your primary link but then you can burst traffic onto a wireless link or any link for that matter so you can have that unlimited always-on wireline connection and again as as your users are demanding more and more bandwidth that go beyond the capacity of that single link you can burst onto that wireless link and so you're optimizing your costs you're optimizing your usage but you're still giving yourself that flexibility to have a higher speed experience so 5g has been talked about for a couple of years now several years actually so it's been a little bit frustrating i think for a lot of people right we keep talking about 5g we keep hearing about it but you know the reality is i still can't have it in my in my ambulance or i still can't have it in whatever application i'm trying to do maybe it's an autonomous car right we're still kind of stuck using 4g in a lot of cases but the really good news is this has given us time to prepare as a vendor right so in 2017 we already knew 5g was coming and so we launched our epx with modular capabilities so that we could upgrade that that router down the road as 5g and other technologies became available so we took that same thought process from our epx into our mbx and our sdx as we deployed more and more uh high quality products out there we made sure that we had that that upgrade path covered for those types of products so that they're really a long-term investment versus kind of a one or two year kind of consumer cycle type product again we wanted to give customers that investment protection as 5g matured and became closer and closer to reality so now again 2020 those modules started to become available we were able to get our hands on modules get into labs start testing those modules and then later in q2 q3 we actually been able to carry out many pilot projects with our global partners and carriers so we can see in the real world how these things behave on the on the 5g networks and so again we're approaching that point where these modules are going to be carrier certified and then the routers will be carrier certified and so depending on your country depending on your carrier we are now accepting orders for these devices and again for the us the carriers aren't quite ready to accept these devices so you know it's not something you can buy right now and start rolling out but you can get first in line to get these devices as they do go through that approval process and in other countries you know it might be a lot easier to get get these rolled out on your carrier networks right now so you need to talk to your account manager at peplink to figure out what's available in your area what the pricing is on that and we'll show you in a little bit what options are available to start pre-ordering so we talked a little bit about kind of the road map and where 5g is right now but just to kind of recap right now especially in the us we're seeing 5g really widespread on those sub 6 frequencies all three major carriers have pretty large footprints on those those sub six frequencies we're also seeing simultaneous deployment of millimeter wave from those carriers again in the u.s i think the major carriers each have about 30 or so cities that they've got some level of millimeter wave coverage in that's not city-wide in most cases i don't believe but again you're starting to see this pop up more and more in the urban areas so globally there's a pretty wide pretty wide adoption of 5g but also quite a bit different focus from some carriers to the others so i think the us and china are probably the furthest along maybe south korea as well and you're starting to see europe and latin america and some of these other territories start to embrace the technology as well so we're really starting to see that momentum shift where almost everybody's got this deployed in some manner now and it's really not a matter of turning it on but improving it at this point so we've talked a lot about technology in the market but let's look at what peplink is going to be making available for 5g devices so we've got six devices here that are 5g ready we've got our mbx this is our really powerhouse mobility router you can use this in a fixed location too if you're trying to get a whole bunch of bandwidth aggregated into one location but again a lot of times we see this in a mobile context we've got our balance 310 5g this is a dual radio 5g and 4g router we've got our pdx this is a rapid deploy tactical solution so all the antennas everything needed all built into one kit that you can throw out anywhere that you need super fast connectivity then on the bottom half we've got our more enterprise focus models we've got our sdx pro which is a new product we just came out with it's got two modular slots so you could have 5g and fiber or whatever mix of technologies you need in there we've got our sdx which is similar to that sdx pro but just one modular bay instead of two and then again we've got the epx our absolute powerhouse this is often deployed in fixed and mobile locations as well i know mobile health imagery mammography those are applications where we've actually seen this product deployed in mobile scenarios as well so let's take it let's take a deeper look at each of these so the mbx 5g this is almost identical to the current mbx there's really no change other than the radio tray that's put on there so again the mbx when it launched was an upgradeable product from day one there's four screws that allow you to remove that radio tray so you just unscrew those four screws if you've got one already pull those radiate pull that radio tray out you can buy a 5g radio tray plug it back in now you're on 5g the mbx is really again the ultimate mobile connectivity solution there's poe on it there's usb there's ethernet wham so if you've got satellite or microwave or other types of links you've got two different wi-fi radios so you can have wi-fi wan and a wi-fi access point you've got lots of capabilities and built into this router and again you've got four cellular connections whether it be 4g or 5g that you can use to aggregate bandwidth or protect real-time applications using those different speed fusion technologies the other really cool thing about mbx is you're not only diversifying and giving yourself redundancy on the on the carrier side you're also really targeting uptime from a power side too the mbx has two different dc power inputs as well as a dc terminal block so you've got two different plugs you can plug power supplies into and you've got a terminal block to hardwire it so you can mix and match those right you can run the the dc barrel jack connector off of a ac to dc inverter and then you can directly hardwire the the dc jack and use the ignition sense to wire it directly to the vehicle's battery so you've got lots of power options that you can use to keep this router up and make sure that you're staying up no matter what out in the field so let's look at some ways people could use this again this doesn't have to be a mobility product you could use this at a fixed location where you just need really good failover connectivity right again you might have one or two gigabit lines coming in over ethernet or fiber and again you need a useful failover connection so you can bond a couple 5gs together to give you that super useful failover and you've got poe output on this device so you can hang some cameras or access points the other cool thing you can do with the mbx is if you're really using a lot of bandwidth out in the field we've got a product called our sim injector and so this allows you to plug this device into the mbx and add even more sim cards to your your connectivity mix so by default the mbx comes with four modems with each two sims an a and a b sim for each modem so that's eight sims total in in the in the traditional mbx deployment form factor but you can add these sim injectors to add eight more eight more sim cards at a time so again if you're consuming massive amounts of bandwidth out in the field and chewing through data plans faster than you can keep track of you can use that sim injector to make sure that you're always using the most affordable connectivity instead of paying for overdrafts again there's lots of different possibilities if we look at a mobile deployment again you can use 5g you can use lte you can use vsat you can use wi-fi from a maybe a port or a hotspot or maybe it's just a depot that you're parking your fleet vehicles in you've got lots of connectivity options on the on the mbx again you can run things like ip cameras access points any sort of poe device with that built in eight port switch of with poe 802.38 poe output on it and you can hang more switches off it whether it's a peplink switch or or a third-party standards compliance switch you can expand the connectivity from that nbx next up is the balance 310 5g this is a new model so it it's real similar to the current 310x or the 310 that you remember from the the wireline only configuration but this has two embedded cellular radios we've got one embedded 5g radio and one embedded 4g radio so you've got the ability to connect to a 5g network and a 4g network simultaneously so you can diversify your carrier mix and make sure you've got the coverage and the speed you need no matter what and then you've got that wire line connectivity as well so this is a great enterprise branch router again whether you're trying to use 5g as the primary link or as a high quality failover this balance 310 5g is going to be a really nice fit for those types of fixed location applications where you're trying to get that wireless connectivity and into that that fixed location again there's all kinds of applications you can use with this so you've got the full you've got the full stack of speed fusion technologies to protect you know your point of sale transactions your voice over ip phones any application you want you can customize and steer your traffic appropriately to those different speed fusion profiles so you can make sure that zoom calls get protected with land smoothing and you can make sure that your point of sale applications have that nice hot failover experience between the primary and in the backup links you don't have to use just one speed fusion mode you can mix and match and use traffic steering to intelligently protect and optimize traffic next up is our pdx 5g again this is a mobile powerhouse it's it's a you've got 5g connectivity you've got poe you've got ac power input dc power input there's optional batteries so you can mix and match your power inputs you can transition from dc to battery to ac and back again without the router going down without any interruption and connectivity so you can get this thing rolled out anywhere you need it and then you can move it anytime you need to without having to interrupt that connectivity that whole top tray has a huge array antenna array in it so you've got really high quality antenna connectivity built right into that box you don't have to mess with you don't have to put tripods up or do anything to get this thing connected you just have to push that power button down let it boot up you're ready to go on the top there's a patch panel so you can map out lan ports or lan ports to those external ethernet ports so that you can maybe you've got a fixed line connection at the location you're at so you can map out a lan port to those external ports using that patch panel or maybe you need to hang up cameras or access points around your perimeter and you can map out those poe lan ports to those those external ports so you can close the lid let this thing run in the rain do whatever right this is a this is a hardened ruggedized device ready to go wherever you need wherever you need that connectivity on the left there's three bays you can see so you can populate those bays with optional batteries or we've got a kit to put our speed fusion engine that tiny little cube shaped router in there so if you need special frequencies or other radio technologies you can add more and more connections to this using those optional bays on the left and of course you've got nice oled status display so you've got one dedicated to the power then you've got one dedicated to the router so that even a non-technical user on site can identify any any problems that might be going on with this and provide helpful feedback to a remote technician so you don't have to deploy it staff with this product and again the uses for this are all over the place um large events you know if you've ever had a conference at a at a hotel or an event center you can you probably know internet connectivity at those types of locations usually starts in the thousands of dollars and moves up to the tens and even hundreds of thousands of dollars so that's a lot of money for what usually is kind of crappy connectivity when it comes down to it if you've ever used the wi-fi at any of these events so events are obviously a great place where you could use this device and you'd be able to actually save a lot of money using this device even at those events public safety is another real common use case for this type of product you know you never know where you're going to need to go day-to-day for some of these first responders and so having as many connections as possible in one box and a ready to go form factor is really really well suited for those public safety critical application type of scenarios again it might be a mobile command scenario where you're setting up a a staging area where you've got lots of different people from lots of different jurisdictions coming in and you might need phones and devices like that to get get commanders connected and communicating and you might have a lot of different systems that also need connectivity so the pdx is a great fit to to get you up and running as fast as possible with connectivity as fast as possible now for all of you that have our flex module capable routers we will be launching 5g capable modules for those routers so again we launched the epx in 2017 with with this in mind right we knew 5g was going to be a requirement for those types of products so anybody who's deployed these since 2017 can upgrade them to 5g so the 5g flex module will have two two 5g connections in it again 5g has a lot more antenna connections so we've got two radios in there instead of three as opposed to the lower category lte configurations we used to see again these have redundant sim slots so for each 5g radio you can put two sim cards in there total of four sim cards across one module and if you've got a router that supports multiple bays you can add two four six however many radios you need to that modular platform so this will be a again a really easy way to get up and running on 5g if you've got one of these modular routers already so here's our sdx pro again a new version that supports these these flex modules this one's got two so again you could maybe let's get two 5g connections and let's get the sfp plus for some gigabit or 10 gigabit fiber connectivity in there now we've got two awesome different technologies all all combined into this one router for for whatever application we need if you need more lte cool you can put four 5g connections in here and utilize those two slots so that covers the current 5g lineup for today there is definitely more in store as as the year changes over here we've got a lot more platforms and development that'll help give you even more 5g connectivity options but again that's what we've got for today so i'll open the floor for questions i see we've got a couple tee'd up here i'll just review those and start answering those feel free to drop those into the q a section okay first one is just kind of a housekeeping item i should have said this at the beginning but nonetheless we are recording this webinar so if you registered and didn't get a chance to join right away or you missed something had to jump out early it will be posted on the forum probably by tomorrow every webinar we do we post on the forum so go go ahead and take a look over on the forum there's a huge backlog of content out there for you to look at and again this this webinar will also show up there as well okay i see a question about 5g at sea so this is an interesting one and we've got a in-house maritime expert sam norris who maybe could speak one better on this than i can but i'll give it a shot from my perspective at least you know 5g at sea there's often not a huge user density out away from the coast and so i think you'll see you know the low band and the mid band frequencies targeted at the at the coastal regions the millimeter wave you know there will definitely be coverage right at right at shore but that won't carry out very far into sea so again i think that sub six spectrum is really where you're going to see a lot of at least initial focus for the maritime applications with with 5g so i see one question on the sim injector how is it connected to an external antenna it's not so the sim injector is an interesting device it's unique to peplink so we're able to take that sim injector and basically transport those sim cards over the ethernet line up to the radio so we've got software and hardware capabilities built into our product to allow that radio to remotely select different sim cards from that sim injector or directly inserted sim cards on on the radio itself so you don't have to have any sort of antenna connection to that sim injector you just have to have an ethernet path from that sim injector to wherever the radio is so it gives you a lot more flexibility to change sim cards out you know you know if your radio is in a hard to reach location you can locate that sim injector in an easy to reach location and swap your sim cards out that way i see another question is your 5g modem cat 18 or something different so the products that we were showing you today are all available in category 18 but category 18 is just gigabit lte it's not 5g some vendors have called it 5g e or some sort of kind of spin on the fact that it is faster than traditional lte but again category 18 is not real lte so that's not what we were talking about on any of these products here those products again we have cat 18 versions of them but everything we showed you today is something that we are launching with a real 5g nr capable radio inside of it and so those those 5g products support actually all of the 4g bands as well so they're they're 5g capable but also able to shift down to 4g connectivity but again nick that's a different model cat 18 versus the 5g models that we showed today what will the cost of the balance 310 5g be um you'll have to reach out to your account manager there i don't have an answer that i can share on the webinar today but i i think you'll find that's actually a pretty reasonably priced product for for an enterprise deployment um i think that's one thing important to talk about too you know another question we get all the time is what about the br1 mini when when's that going to be 5g well the br1 mini is a 300 or less product and these 5g modules right now are not cheap so you know it's not going to be possible to deliver that low cost of a product in a 5g form factor today but we have some new platforms and new efforts in development that'll really help us drive the cost of 5g down so again the first wave will really be targeted at enterprise and mobility applications but in the not too distant future you'll start to see the those costs and price points shift downward into the more mainstream type applications as well i see another question about the sim injector does it work does it just have to work off the radios in the main device will work with other devices like the hd4 the sim injector again requires hardware and software compatibility so it's not going to work with all of our products but it will work with a lot of them the mbx and the hd1 hd2 domes are both examples of products that support that sim injector capability i believe our ubr products as well support that capability but it is a model to model compatibility so you'll want to double check with your account manager if you need to use that on a particular product and find out which ones are exactly capable of that i see a question that i think i addressed here can you confirm that these will be backwards compatible and so yes the 5g modules we're using are backwards compatible with 4g and so you can connect to 5g and 4g simultaneously even in some scenarios but yes if 5g isn't available on your carrier but 4g is these these modules can scale back and connect to the 4g networks another question on the pdx does it have omnidirectional antennas yes that that whole top lid is filled with an omnidirectional antenna array and so you can lay it on its side lay it on it lay it flat and still get nice nice smooth coverage from those antennas i see a couple questions on the balance 20x will that be able to support 5g and the answer is probably a maybe there there's some speed limitations on that i've put a post up in the partner forum so if you're a public partner go check that out and share your thoughts on on the 20x and what you what you think is reasonable there i see a question is it possible to upgrade a max hd2 router so if your router doesn't have the modular capability in it like our x series products do the answer unfortunately is no to that that those products with the embedded modems aren't really field upgradeable so another question will the will there be a single antenna that can cover the full 5g spectrum or do we need to have an array to get the range between sub sub 1 gigahertz and the millimeter wave so this is a really good question and i should have touched on this earlier sub 6 i i mentioned is basically the same kind of technology as as lte today in terms of the antennas and in terms of how the signal propagates it's very similar to the 4g world a sub 6 5g router requires four antenna connections just like the category 18 lte radios do so that's that four by four mimo but the millimeter wave technology is dramatically different millimeter wave modules require the antenna to be manufactured by qualcomm and they require the antenna to be just a few inches from that radio and in terms of manufacturing there's a lot of calibration there's just a lot more complexity with the millimeter wave technology and so you know really the f the initial push on 5g for the mobility space is going to be in the sub six and again that's the easiest 5g connectivity to deploy in terms of that antenna connection as well so you'll start to see more external radio products for 5g coming out with the millimeter wave capability again you know if you think about our hd1 hd2 dome that's a great example of where we would probably deploy the millimeter wave technology and you need that radio and antenna coupled right together so that you can get that connectivity right where the signal is again that millimeter wave isn't going to go inside your building inside your it closet so you're going to need to put that antenna outside in an area that's going to get really clear line of sight to that 5g millimeter wave node so again you'll see the 5g millimeter wave stuff start to take shape much more in 2021 the the first push will really be on the sub six frequencies i see a question on na versus nsa or sa versus nsa mode yes our modules support both that's a super technical detail that does matter but if you don't know what it is i wouldn't worry too much about it but short answer is yes we support both sa and nsa [Music] are there any restrictions to use these products in the us yes the carriers have not certified any modules for 5g for routers yet so you can use them either in a pilot form factor if you're working with a carrier otherwise they're not um really allowed yet by the carriers so there's some more formalities that need to take place there but again none of these 5g modules for routers have been certified by the carriers in the us yet so there's a little bit more work to be done before that's ready see a question about the transit duo will there be similar models like that with 5g capabilities again early next year we'll have some more platforms that are able to deliver 5g into different form factors different price points so certainly there's thing things on our roadmap to enable 5g connectivity in all sorts of form factors um that's not something right away today but again early next year we'll start to be able to share more information on on those types of devices as well a lot of questions on cost you got to reach out to your account manager for that just let them know which model you're interested in if it's an upgrade option or a new product you're looking for just reach out to your public account manager or distributor and we'll get those questions rolled up to the accounts team and answered what antenna array is the pdx using it's a custom design solution that's about as much as i can say there but it's not something we bought off the market it's specifically designed for the pdx question about the puma antennas so another great question our puma antennas are great fit for sub six 5g they cover all the way from 600 megahertz up to six gigahertz so there's a huge section of spectrum that those cover so they're a great fit for these 5g routers again the lte coverage on on those different models the spectrum coverage is the same so any of those puma antennas are going to be a great choice as long as you've got the right number of leads so like the puma 401 would be a great 5g capable antenna for that sub 6 spectrum if you don't know who your account manager is reach out to the place that you purchased it from they bought it from a distributor and they'll be able to kind of link the chain up to up to our account management team and get you that pricing information so your point of purchase is the best place to reach out to they may not have the information on hand themselves but they will relay that request up and we'll get you the information you need i see a question about health risks of using 5g what's my opinion on this well i don't think 5g causes covid first of all i'll just address that one right out of the gate i think some of us have seen those maps that kind of match up 5g deployment with covid cases and you know they're around population centers um i don't think 5g causes covid but more seriously um does 5g cause some sort of cancers or other sorts of things i haven't seen i really haven't seen a lot of change in the research on this over the years right this has been well researched over many years for cellular technologies in general and you know putting really loud radios next to your head is not a great idea in general but these devices are very very low powered you know we're talking way less than one watt in most cases so i haven't seen anything compelling that says 5g is dramatically different from a health perspective so i see a few questions on like product availability you know we've got these modules in hand right now we've got live pilot projects going on with customers in lots of different countries so if you've got something really hot and you you know you've got carrier approval or or that's possible then that's something very likely you could get right now if you really had something real to to use these for so again reach out to your point of purchase and or account manager and and we'll have a discussion about that and see what's what's realistic given your carrier and your geography all right folks we've got four minutes left here i'm going to give you that time back really appreciate all the participation and everybody's time here today thanks again my name is travis durrick so feel free to reach out on the forum and again look to the forum for updates on this recording and other 5g information [Music]"}

joining us from asia we will be getting started now so pip blank's mission statement is to create smart unbreakable connectivity anytime anywhere today we'll be going through how you can achieve that using piplink's range of products and services to create the perfect solution so rvs cover many different types of vehicles we have a solution for all of them 2020 has been a very strange year and there has been much more full-time usage of rvs and the requirement for connectivity has also increased with this due to the work from home situation so let's have a look at some of the challenges faced by rvs when staying connected on the move the system needs to be user friendly you need to have an easy you need to be easily able to change the settings you need reliable connectivity even in remote locations our solutions will keep you connected anywhere there is cellular coverage and if you go beyond cellular coverage satellite connectivity can also manage through our solution being truly mobile means being connected even while moving mobile internet needs to be affordable how much it costs depends on how much usage you require so today we're going to cover top five features which are useful for recreational vehicles i'm going to go through the configuration of of each of these kind of ideas as well so you can actually see how things are done so firstly we'll have a look at the basic thing that pep link routers function with internet connectivity we allow you to use any internet connection and any combination you like you can mix and match wi-fi adsl fiber cellular and vsat etc these can be introduced quickly and easily for example wi-fi when at an overnight stop so let's have a look at the router and face now today i'll be using a category 12 ubr go which is similar to a transit joy which a lot of you will be familiar with okay it doesn't want to connect to me locally so i'm just going to use uh in control okay so this is the um dashboard that you will be presented with when you log into a pep wave router it'll be slightly different depending on which model you have um this has got two cellular ones so on the ubrgo there are two two cellular wands two wifi wands that's one for 2.4 gigahertz and one for five gigahertz as well as an ethernet wan port the ethernet was input can be used for any internet connection presented via a network cable this could be from a fiber aesl or satellite modem so this unit has been factory reset to its default settings and i've plugged an ethernet wan into it so it's only connected over the ethernet wan and that's done it automatically i haven't configured any settings in the way in there so i'm now going to connect the wi-fi wands to my wi-fi here and you'll see it's connected so this would be for an example when you pull into a park for the night and there's wi-fi available there so the two wi-fi wands one is 2.4 gigahertz and one is five gigahertz so we're going to scan the networks now and we should see the pip wave 2.4 gigahertz so we're going to connect to that put the password in and save that and we can close that one and that one will get connected now and then on the five gigahertz one we're going to do the same thing as well so obviously you don't have to connect to two you could just connect to one um but connecting to two gives you more reliability so there you can see it's connected now on the 2.4 gigahertz one and the five gigahertz one is going to follow soon as well okay so the next thing we are going to cover is multiple network utilization so this is one of the key underlying uses for pep blank routers by using different setups such as load balancing failover lowest car cost and bonding with our speed fusion multi-way and vpn you can create an always-on internet connection so let's have a look at how you can utilize multiple different internet connections so now we're going to navigate to the outbound policies these can be found under the advanced settings so we go advanced and then we go to outbound policies so outbound policies dictate where your traffic is going to go so let's create a rule directing all traffic to to primarily use wifiwan and then fail over to cellular so this is all traffic so we're going to say all traffic you can call it anything you want um source is any because that's any of the devices on our network and the destination is any because we don't care where it's going so what we're now going to do is we're going to select priority for the algorithm and we want priority one to be the wi-fi one because that's the cheapest internet connectivity available to us so we can put the two wi-fi wands there and depending on what the wi-fi wearing is you can put that in there as well and also have the cellular ones there so what this means is that the first network connection to be used is going to be the uh 2.4 gigahertz wi-fi wan then if that fails it'll automatically switch to five gigahertz if that fails it'll switch to the one and down to the cellular as well so we can save that rule now and you will see it there so we can then also create other rules as well the rules are matched from top to bottom so we can create another rule that's going to force an individual device to do just use the wi-fi ram so this is useful if you've got a device that you only want to use wi-fi wan because you don't want it using lots of data when you're on the cellular networks so we can specify the source as uh the ip address or an ip network mac address etc so say the ip address of the device is 192.168.51.50 and then we want to put the algorithm as enforced and we want to force that to one of the wi-fi ones and let's say it was a tv so we can say tv2 wi-fi only and then we save that so as long as that rule that we created is at the top that tv rules we match first just for that ip address and it's gonna be forced to use the wi-fi ram all the other devices we have access to the wi-fi wan which will then also fail over to the cellular so you can also specify a whole subnet so create separate ssids and things like that so the third thing that we are going to look at is the speed fusion cloud so speed fusion cloud was launched earlier this year and allows you to use speed fusion simply without having to set up a new point to terminate your speed fusion tunnel we have done all the hard work for you speed fusion cloud is now included with our care plans please check out our forum for the full details of the data included other ways you can otherwise you can purchase an appropriate data package currently you get can get 100 gigabytes free trial please visit our website for more information so let's have a quick look at how to set up speed fusion cloud and get it get connected in a matter of seconds so firstly you're going to want to make sure that you are running the latest firmware if you've got a device that's running some slightly odd firmware you won't have the speed fusion cloud tab so what you want to do is you want to click on get your activation code into your email address and you'll also want to enter the serial number of your device here confirm you're not a robot and then submit it so i've already registered this one so that's why it says failed um but if we go back to the device now um i've got the activation code it's been sent to me via email so now if i click on system [Music] and we will go to feature add-on and i'm going to copy and paste the activation key so we're going to paste that there and activate it and now the 100 gigabytes license is active so now we can go back to speed fusion cloud now you'll see the the windows change bit here so now you can actually select a location so we click on choose cloud location you can set it to automatic if you want but today i am going to select london so i'm going to go down to united kingdom london and then you click the green tick beside it and then you click apply changes and now as simple as that it is going to create the vpn tunnel to london and get connected so if we go back to the dashboard now there will be a window that will pop up here in a second down towards the bottom with the speedfusion details there we are so now you can see split fusion cloud to london is clear in the tunnel and a few seconds there it will be connected there we go so now it's established so now we have a speed fusion vpn setup that's how easy it is to set it up so now you can direct traffic to use that tunnel um using your outbound policies that we were looking at just before so we will return there now so for example that tv that re the rule we've had for the tv to enforce it to only use the wi-fi if we open up this box here now you'll see there's another one the speedfusion cloud london so you can force that tv just to use that spearfusion cloud vpn another way that is even simpler to do it is in the speedfusion cloud settings you can connect an individual client to the tunnel so you can say i want this device to go to it can be done by ip address and it'll automatically create a list of all the devices on your network here so currently i only have one computer connected but i could click that it's already got the ip address there and then we click save so now any traffic from my laptop uh over that router will go out over that vpn to london using speedfusion that's how some blitters once obviously once we click apply changes okay so the fourth thing we are going to cover is secure wi-fi wan so so when you connect um your router to wi-fi wan you that you don't control how do you know that your data is secure using speedfusion you can encrypt the data over the wi-fi link so that nobody can see what you're doing online so as sp fusion operates in encrypted mode by default any traffic passing between your router and the speed fusion endpoint is encrypted and protected from pryon eyes no need to worry about insecure wi-fi networks anymore and the fifth thing that we are going to cover is controlling bandwidth so controlling bandwidth is important if you're paying for the consumption so some streaming applications will use the highest quality definition they can push through sometimes the throughput can be 20 to 30 megabytes per second just for one video stream and if you're seeing a location that's got really fast internet available it'll pull that through it so what we can do is we can limit the speed of a particular device to say 5 or 10 megabytes per second so doing this you can make sure that one device is not hammering your internet connection so this can be applied to individual devices groups or whole vlans so to do this you navigate to the advanced settings and you go to user groups so you can see i've already created one here um so it's done by ip address you can also do it with subnet so i've just made up an ip address at dot 50 and i've added it to the staff network so once you've created that for an individual device or a whole subnet you can then go to bandwidth controls you'll then want to enable individual bandwidth limit and on the staff network you consider maximum download speed of say five megabytes per second and an upload speed of say one megabyte per second and then you click save and apply so now what that means is each device that falls into that staff user group will get a maximum of 5 megabytes per second so that video stream that you have going that was before easily taking 20 or 30 megabytes per second of the highest quality video it can get is now going to scale it down to a lower quality but still a decent quality video and it's not going to use as much of your precious data okay so now i'm going to switch back to the slideshow so now we're going to take a look at some of our products in our portfolio which will help you create unbreakable connectivity wherever you are so today we're going to focus on the transit series and the x series of routers alongside the puma antennas so the transit mini is a single cellular router which will provide you with basic connectivity it supports one active cellular connection ethernet wan and wifi worm it can be powered by 12 to 28 volt dc making it great for low voltage installations the max throughput of the transit mini is 100 megabits per second it supports band 71 which is great for the us it has multiple sim card slots so you can put two sim cards in there but you can only use one at a time so that can be good for having two sim cards from different providers if you're in some remote areas that have different coverage from different providers depending on where you are the next model we're going to look at is the transit duo this is very similar to the ubrgo which is the model i was showing just before so the transit duo is a dual cellular router with ethernet wan and two wi-fi winds so one of the 2.4 gigahertz and one on 5 gigahertz as the transit joy has two cellular modems it allows you to create a much more reliable connection with two different sim cards active at the same time for the best results and to increase coverage um areas and throughput the sims should be from different carriers the transit jira can be powered from 12 to 48 volts dc making it great for low voltage installations this model supports up to 400 megawatts of throughput so that's up from the 100 megabits throughput of the transit mini the final router that we are going to look at is our powerhouse mbx which is built for unbreakable connectivity on the road it comes in two versions the hd2 and hd4 the hd2 has two cellular modems and the hd4 has four cellular modems the modems are upgradable meaning that you can easily upgrade 5g when coverage is available without having to replace the whole router mbx is capable of two and a half gigabits per second throughput making it perfect for situations where high speed is required the eight ethernet lan ports support uh poa meaning less cables you don't have to have separate cables pairing up iptv cameras or ip cameras things like that our puma antennas are built for 5g and perfect for discrete installation on your vehicles the 401 supports 4 cellular bands plus gps there's a super wideband antenna supporting from 698 through to 6 000 megahertz all the perma antennas are available in black or white with qma or sma connectors so most of our routers are sma connectors um whereas the one root of that is qma is the hd4mdx that has um the hd4 mbx category 18 and 5g version are qma connectors the pyramid020 is for wi-fi this can be connected to the wi-fi antenna ports on your pip blank router to connect to the wi-fi wands around your vehicle this creates a much better connection to the wi-fi that is available wherever you end up so this is an overview of an installation with an mbx in a vehicle you would require two or four puma 401s plus one puma zero two zero on the roof depending on which model of nbx is installed um if you go with the hd2 category um 18 you'd need um four antennas the hd4 category 12 would require um two 402s uh sorry 401s and the hd4 category 18 or 5g would require four puma 401s using speedfusion cloud you can then combine all the available connections into a single fast and reliable unbreakable internet connection keeping you connected anytime anywhere in control 2 can be used to remotely monitor and configure devices all over the world perfect supported for supporting multiple users in different locations so some of the top five features of uh for rv that we have covered today are speed fusion cloud to create unbreakable connections simply multiple network utilization to get better coverage and higher throughputs secure wi-fi wan so your internet connection remains private even on public networks bandwidth controls to limit data usage and prevent too much data being used and any internet connection the ability to add any internet connection to the mix so have a look at the youtube changing lanes the youtube channel changing lanes they've got an amazing video showing how they use our equipment to live and work in their amazing rv mobile mustang have a series of videos all about our products and some amazing shots of them being installed in the wild links for both of these youtube channels and videos will be shared in the chat very soon okay time for some questions and answers so we've already received um a few come in by email so i will start with those um if you do have any questions please use the questions and answer function of zoom there have been um [Music] there have been a few questions coming already but i will start with a few that we've already received via email so tate scott asked would love to hear options um to improve airstream connect with piplink modems with low balancing on the max transit duo etc that don't harm airstream connect so airstream connect users generally they use our transit duo and with that you can use all of the features of our software without harming anything you can use load balancing you could use a speed fusion cloud um you can set up however you want you're not going to necessarily harm anything um if they've set up anything that they said you might not want to change if they need connection to anything um then yeah you might want to talk to them about that but generally you can load balance and send your internet however you want to um okay george um george keller asked about the the status of verizon product certifications um so i'll skip to the next slide here um so this slide shows all of our products that are currently certified to be used on the verizon network this is as of today we updated this recently so the br1 classic the br1 mini core um the ac2 ip67 the transit category 18 transit mini um our flex modules the miniflex modules um and the flex module category 12 and corrugating as well as all of the mbx models so all of those models on screen are certified for verizon okay i am going to switch to some of the questions and answers i'm just going to go through the chat first because there were a few questions that came in there as well okay so daryl wood has asked can one expect superior signal quality using a boosted cellular puma versus a boosted yagi directional okay so um when you say boosted i'm assuming you mean like a cellular booster if you use a proper antenna you shouldn't need a booster if you install the antenna on the roof and that kind of stuff get it all installed properly you shouldn't need a booster um but however using a puma versus the yaki that really depends on your location um so if you are in a um built up area close to networks and things like that then the pumas will be will be good um if you're in a very remote location where signal is very hard to get then yes a jaeger might be what you need to get a directional antenna pointed at the tower so obviously the pumas you don't need a point in the tower you just have them set up and they just work whereas the yogis you'll need to point them at the antenna at the cell tower each time you sit up um okay joel bean is asking um when will you release a category 18 jillsome modem um we've got the hd 4mbx it has got a category 18 version of it the transit duo won't have a category 18 version and there is there's two kind of reasons for that one is the throughput of the router so the category 12 modems and the in the um hd and the transit duo are capable of 600 megabytes download and that's their rated um throughput per modem um but the router itself is only rated 400 megabits throughput so already with two modems in there like that the modems are really well over spec then the router's throughput um also we don't have the the second reason is the space for the antenna connectors because the category 12 modems have two antenna connectors and the category 18s have four so there's just not quite the space on the transit duo to fit that um so if you need dual category 18 you'll want to go with the hd2 or hd4 mbx um it gives you much higher throughputs and you'll get you'll see the best you can get out those modems there as well you won't be limited by the router throughput okay the cost of speed fusion cloud if you go to pip blank you will be able to find all the details about that i'm going to bring it up now so you can see it okay so we have um well first of all i'll just show you the locations of the speedfusion cloud so this is our current list of locations about two weeks ago we did add a whole lot of these in so there are a lot more than you might have realized since you last checked so these are the data plans that we have available for speed fusion cloud so obviously we start here with the um with the free plan so you can trial it out and see how it works so that starts at um you get 100 gigabytes free and the throughput is limited at 50 megabytes per second and it is valid for one month and then you have the pricing for the additional usage here so as you can see the pricing is very very attractive um and it is you can give it a go no risk so that where that question was from mark what is the cost of uh speakership cloud um okay scott roberts asks are there any recommendations for ruggedized hardware versus conventional duty hardware for more off-road orientated vehicles um so you had a var saying something to this effect when i when you priced your last install so with the the routers that we're covered are the kind of ruggedized ones that are designed to be installed in vehicles they're designed to be uh to withstand vibrations so the transit duos the um mbxes the hd4s they've all been built to be in vehicles um and they can take that vibration that kind of stuff um i think what you're saying about they recommended not using some others maybe that was made when they were talking about maybe the balance uh 30 lte those kind of ones they are those ones are designed more to be installed um in an office and use the cellular as a failover um but yeah all the products we've been talking about today are designed to be [Music] designed to be on the road james asked about um the verizon uh certification there so we're showing the br1 classic working with verizon uh does the same applies to br1 mark ii um travis could you please um check on that i'm not exactly sure on that from will richards we use a puma and it's been awesome it was a big boost to the signal will that is great news good to hear it um which modem you use and which which model route you using with that okay i'm just looking through some uh more of the questions in the chat here and then i'm going to switch over to um the questions and answers uh rob um taylor asked i said can't find the ubr go lte data sheet on your site um we can share a link with you for that the specifications of the ubr go are very similar to the transit duo same throughput wi-fi things like that the main there's two main differences or three main differences with it um one it has um three wan ports whereas the uh sorry three lan ports not wan ports three lan ports and one wan port so you can connect more devices to it one of those lan ports is also poe um another difference is the power it's powered by a usbc power input and then the third major difference is it supports our remote sim technology so you can use a sim injector or remote sims with it we've covered that in some other webinars there and there's lots of info about it on our forum as well by the way guys if there's any features of the configurations that you want me to cover but more um i can actually go back and go through the configurations live with you if there's any kind of settings that you want to see um changed and and things like that so yeah put those in the questions and answers as well okay so i'm just looking through a few more questions here um uh joey janssen asks will there be any easton ready um pip link devices coming soon um we have got a one esom product that will be coming out very soon it's called the max adapter um there will be more information about that um coming out soon but that is a it's more of a hotspot device that you plug into your computer so it'll be single cellular um i'm not exactly sure what the hardware team is planning with any other esim products and that but it's it could be something that might be coming i'm not exactly sure on that though okay so the br1 mark ii and transit you are both certified verizon i've just had confirmation of that marty weston asked will the transit mini be upgraded with 5g or will a new route be required so the only routers that we've got that are upgradable are the um is the mbx and some of the other x-series ones like the epx and the balance 30x now with the flex modules so routers like the br1 um and the transits they don't have upgradable modems so it won't be possible you'll have to um get a new router um there will be new platforms out to support the much higher throughputs of 5g as well because the br1 throughputs um the br1 is limited 100 megabits throughput and if you put a 5g modem in that it's not going to um perform as 5g as you kind of expect it to um chris summers asked the difference between the br1 mark ii and the transit duo so the br1 is maximum throughput of 100 megabits per second and it is a single cellular router so it only has one cellular modem in it the transit duo has a roof throughput of 400 megabits per second and it's dual cellular throughput it supports higher speed fusion bonding throughputs and all round it's got better wi-fi it's it's a much better device for throughputs and usage on the road it allows you to connect to multiple cellular networks at the same time um and with the prime care model it works out to not be much more expensive than the br1 and you get a lot more for it so definitely have a look at it it's definitely worth worth the extra money uh scott's asking as you're recording the webinar yes we will be putting a recording of this up on um it'll be posted on the forum and it'll also be sent out in an email um so to everyone that signed up for it um yeah so they'll be posted on youtube um probably on friday it'll be available okay so now to some more questions and answers that have come in now um okay so how to connect to those wi-fi servers that need our input via browser these pages require a name phone number etc in order to give us access so with the um portals and that kind of stuff generally what you'll do is connect to the portal and then you need to be able to access the [Music] the splash page such and once you log in you're authorizing the pip wave as a device to access that internet not your end device and that should be good for however long until the portal kind of signs you out and you need to re-sign in again ultimately it's better if there is no portal on the wi-fi but that's not always possible is it um so chris sims asks when all three options are priority one which is the preferred outbound path okay so um let me bring up the one so are you meaning on um you've got the three and priority one here um so if you've got three and priority one here the um it'll be depending on how you have your outbound policies set up so if you have your outbound policies set up to priority or weighted balance and things like that um so if it doesn't match up a rule it'll go to the default and the default is auto i'm just in the gui here these little question marks here they've got a lot of information behind them so click on them they'll open up little windows like that and actually explain what what things are so yeah here you can create a rule to create different um different outbound rules to go to different different uh wands um jan asks can i use other vpn files like nordvpn so we you can't connect the pip wave um to the nord vpn um but you can use nord vpn on your laptop um behind the pip wave so i think what you're asking by can you use other vpn providers can you connect the pep wave to them the answer is no you can't um it's not possible to do that um joe asks how does speed fusion cloud benefit rv users so speed fusion cloud benefits rv users by allowing them to easily utilize [Music] the benefits of speed fusion of the multi-lan bonding and hot failover and things like that without having to set up your own speed fusion tunnel endpoints so it means you can simply utilize speed fusion to bond your connections together and keep your connection always on another question from joe would you please discuss how peplink manages multiple wan connections round robin um israel algorithm tunable yes completely that's here in the outbound policies that we were just having a look at so in the outbound policies if we click on add rule we've got the algorithms here so again click on the question mark there it'll bring up all this information explain each one there so you can select the different ones depending on how you want um the traffic to go so that can be for all the traffic on on the on the network or it can just be for one individual device so you can set up very specific rules for specific devices and so you could have lots of rules or you could just have simple rules so that all the traffic behaves the same way okay there are a few more questions here um so will richards when will the max bl1 5g model be coming out and can you explain exactly what speed fusion is and does um to me it just sounds like a vpn tunnel pretty simple but there may be more to it that i'm missing okay so there isn't a br1 5g model as such um that has been um announced or anything yet so that will be coming in the future there will be something coming in the future that uh fills that area of the market um but we don't have any details of it just yet um so the second spot so speed fusion so speed fusion is a vpn but it's a pep link proprietary vpn it uses multiple wands to keep your internet connected at all times so i will show you the um the speed fusion cloud that i've set up here i'll show you exactly what's happening on it and you'll understand a bit better on the multiple ways what's happening on it so if we go speed fusion and we can see that the one connection here to london has got it's using three connections so this wan is an ethernet one into my home internet and the wi-fi when is also into my home internet but that could they could be into different internet connections so um just for the sake of the demo let's let's pretend that they're all different internet sources as such and then what i can do here now is i can do an internet i can do speed test so i'm going to switch that to download just remember that this is a free trial that i'm using here as well so it's going to be limited to 50 megabytes per second so i'm going to hit download here and as you can see the download that data is coming across three different wands there and it's aggregating it to be up at just below 50 megabytes per second at the same time what we can also do here is simulate a wan failing so i'm going to change this to 200 seconds just so that this test keeps on going while i'm changing them so if we were on a skype call or something like that now that traffic is gonna be split and you can see it split over the three different connections and let's say for example this the wi-fi wan fails and we can't we turn that off so that could be because someone's unplugged the router or something that kind of stuff and now you can see that all the traffic is now switched and all going through the lan when the wi-fi wind comes back it's going to start routing traffic over it so you can see it's back now and boom now it's rooting traffic as well and then someone unplugs that cable and that wan has gone down now and all the traffic is going over the wi-fi way in there and we can turn on the other wi-fi when and it's going to load balance it across that one as well so if you were on a skype call or something like that the whole time that those wands were going up and down as long as you had one wan available that skype call would have just kept on going you would have not even noticed that the wands went up or down so that that's what speed fusion is it keeps you connected all the time as long as you've got one connection available and you don't even notice it um i hope that answered that question will um okay john is asking would i still need a cell phone bilster like a wilson wii boost um if you have proper antennas properly installed up as high as you can get them that you shouldn't need a repeater like that um it really depends on your location you might find you end up in a very rural location and a booster does work for you but generally a booster would not be required what i'd recommend you focus on rather than a booster is going for um nice short antenna cable runs so if you can install their router up high up very close engine that's that's the best um kind of uh way to go focus on the antennas and the short and near runs so bob says the max bl1 mini lta would be a good option for an rv um yeah so the br1 is a good option um but what we're really promoting is the use of our multicellular ones so multicellular routers give a much better user experience it means you can properly utilize things like the speed fusion and multiple sim cards multiple carriers that kind of stuff okay so um chris summer asks um can you do uh connection bonding with a max br1 mark ii with two different carrier sim cards or with a mix of wands so with the br1 it's a single cellular modem it has two sim card slots but only one modem so you can't bond the two sim cards together because you can only use one of them at a time but you can when using speed fusion cloud you can bond um the the active sim card and the ethernet wan or the wi-fi ram you can bond those three so you can mix the lands up there but you can't actually bond two sim cards with a br1 because it it is single modem as such if you did want to bond two sim cards you would be best off looking at the transit duo and pete paisley uh he said you mentioned satellite support please elaborate so if you need satellite you can use the ethernet wan ports on our router so you're still going to need to use the satellite modem that's supplied by your satellite provider so you would set that up as normal but then instead of connecting to the wi-fi that modem directly you can actually plug the ethernet into the pip wave and then the pep wave can handle the usage um directing different traffic to the different lands so you can have use the satellite as a failover so you can use cellular primarily and fail over to the satellite or if you want to have certain things just go to the satellite you can do that it really depends on your setup everyone has a very different setup and your setup will be personal depending on your connectivity options and we've just got the routers that can support all those different types of options scott yates um asks can the max transit uh max duo so obviously the max transit duo act as a local wi-fi access point yes it can so it has wi-fi wan and land simultaneously so it can be connected to wi-fi and use that as this internet source and also broadcast its wifi as a lan access point as well as such um george keller asks can you discuss vpn usage over cellular outside of speed fusion so i'm assuming this means that you um like a vpn like the nord vpn i was mentioned earlier or something like that so you can use that outside um so that would be direct from your laptop out of the connection that's provided by the pep wave and that would that would work no problem people do that that can also be used for vpns to connect to offices and things like that corporate setups things like that as well okay i'm just going through some more other questions here um simon bush asked do we need to add uh wi-fi access point like the ap1 mini for a wireless device if using one or both wi-fi wan frequencies no you don't as i just mentioned for the previous question there the wi-fi wan and access point function simultaneously so if we look here on the dashboard you can see that we've got the two wi-fi wands connected here and we've also got the wi-fi access point enabled and running and that's all running using the same wi-fi so there is no need for an additional access point if you want to you can put an additional access point which will increase your coverage and things like that but you don't have to you can keep it all in one device um miguel asks can only vpn traffic afford to the speed fusion uh in your example you use the ubrgo is it discontinued on the website there's only ubr no the ubr goes not discontinued it's a new model um it's not on our website yet we can share with you the data sheet for it um if you head over to the forum uh we will post some information the links and that kind of stuff there um so the links to like the data sheet for the ubr go um and there's a few other models there as well um for oh do so uh jonathan reveals to us we are using balance routers as endpoints is there possibly do a hot failover to speed fusion cloud and is there a possibility to use vrrp at layer 2 for redundancy between a balanced router and a virtual machine okay so there's a quite a bit going on and there um so you can use a balance router as the end point for your own speed fusion so you can set up speed fusion between um two people purpling routers um and you don't use speed fusion cloud for that as such um at the same time you can also use speed fusion cloud in that mix as a hot failover as like a standby backup if you wanted to um and is there a possibility to use vrrp at layer 2 for redundancy between the balance router and virtual machine um i think we'll need a little bit more information on exactly how you want to set that up but there should be a way that something can be done around that to create some redundancy there for you okay just going through some more questions here there are quite a few here so i'm going to try and crack through them i'm just going to switch back to the chat there so there's a few questions a few more conversations that have been um going on there uh just looking through it um so john asks is the pricing for speed fusion per month or for the total juris duration duration listed so it's for the duration listed um so if we um where did i have that i think yeah so you'll see here we have the um speed fusion cloud so with these packages so if we look at the um package b plan b that's 500 gigabytes which is valid for six months so it's not 500 gigabytes per month it's 500 gigabytes of which you can use over a six month period if you use that 500 gigabytes before the six months is up you can just purchase another 500 gigabytes you don't have to wait until that six months is up or you can purchase a larger package and then again down here like the 10 terabytes that is valid for three years so you've got three to 10 terabytes that you can use um at any point over those three years could so you could use that 10 terabytes all in one month if you wanted to and then just purchase another 10 terabytes it's it's very flexible that way so that was a question from jan okay so from will richards use about 500 gigabytes per month is there a plan for that um it depends where you're located um there is different different regions have different plans i know europe is um tends to be a lot uh easier for data packages um so there's definitely packages out there i do know of clients that are using um up around 10 terabytes a month on cellular um in europe while growing that's done through packages with four sim cards through the same provider so it is possible to get large data packages but obviously the more data you use the more it is going to cost mark us sorry you might have already mentioned it which pip wave device are you doing this demo on i'm i was doing the demo here on a ubr go um it does say yes so it says ubr go there so the ubrgo is like a transit duo it's similar specs to it just a few minor differences again we'll share those details on the forum there okay scrolling down a little bit here through a few more questions uh okay it's a few more it's just a bit of conversation okay okay i'll come back to the questions answers now um okay so max says uh just some feedback i have a transit juror category 12 plus a duo category 18 and the wan port so i'm assuming you've got a transit duo category 12 and a um a transit category 18 single modem in the wan port with verizon att and t-mobile um using speed fusion uh and it is head and shoulders above other solutions i've tried almost everything else my wife now does conference calls while we drive and we're so confident in the community there's great that is exactly what uh we strive to do and it's great to hear that you're getting the results that you want okay once another question here uh once the device is out of warranty you cannot manage it through in control um is it possible to extend the warranties to continue to manage it within control yes it is possible to extend the warranty um so you can for the br ones um and some of the balances you can just purchase just the in-control shoe license just by itself um but for the transit duos the nbxes and those models it needs to be in warranty to you size and control too so you can easily extend the warranty and you'll continue to benefit from those features some of the models like our the transit joe now also come in prime here and prime care includes warranty and the um and control as well and the speed fusion bonding license um daniel is uh has asked can the software be improved to speed up the time to switch sims on a modem it takes five minutes or more today um it sometimes depends on the networks as well um because the sim cards do need to um kind of connect to the networks as well there's there's only so much we can speed up in that way if it does five minutes does seem like a bit long if you want to open up a support ticket for that the engineers will definitely have a look at it for you george keller has asked under advanced there is ipsec vpn um how do you use that so the ip6vpn that is in our routers is for site-to-site connections so that would be to connect um a pip vpn router to something like a firewall in an office or a corporate situation that's what that's for us it's not to connect to a ipsec vpn service as such that you can sign up for uh miguel uh sorry what about only vpn with speedfusion i'm not exactly sure what um your meaning there but there's you can use a vpn from your laptop straight out over the pep wave or through speed fusion as well so you could have a vpn inside a vpn that's completely possible as well okay um there's a few more questions there that i'm going to get through as well but we're getting towards the end of them there if you do have any questions please um please ask them now and i will try and get them answered if there's any more questions there okay uh marty asks uh will the transit many be upgraded 5g or real new router be required yeah a new route will be required the uh the the transits are not upgradable as such um anthony asks what is the status of the max br1 mini i'm assuming that is in relation to the verizon certification is what you're meaning there um so if we have a look at the skeptic slideshow so we've got the br1 mini core is certified verizon i will check on that because the bl1 mini i believe should be certified as well but we will i will check with uh travis on that um bill bill johnson um using the pepway surf soho martha i've found that in case of high density situations the five gigahertz wi-fi is one and fails back frequently to 2.4 gigahertz um each time taking the road two to three minutes to fall back is there any fix for this so the route presents more reliable connection um for the connected users um could you please open a support ticket for that um it does um it sounds like there might be something going on with the wifi but if it is dense and the wi-fi is kind of um using its protocols to to make things better then that's just naturally what wi-fi will do um yeah but open a support ticket if you feel it's not working as you would expect it to um also posted on the forum there someone might have a little trick for it there's there is a lot of information on the forum there uh jonathan says we notice that the bandwidth limit is defined per interface but we want to limit a total limit uh we also know bursts of data influences our audio codecs when combining a high latency connection such as satellite for example in the tour de france um yeah so with um i'll answer the second question there first so if you're using a high latency connection such as satellite um and you've got them with speed fusion you'll only want it as a failover like a hot fail over the speed view and you don't want to bond it with the other connections the bonding the latency difference is just too much and the bonding will not work as you expect it to um and then defining the bandwidth limit per interface i'm assuming that's on the ethernet when and faces um you can define it if you want to define a a total limit um you can use the user groups and bandwidth reservation groups there as well to set up something that would suit your setup okay so i'm just going to go down to the bottom of the questions now i think i have answered most of the ones that i can for now um daniel um asks can the iphone ipad apps be improved some would like to be able to switch sims from modem from the app okay that is a great feature request daniel um if you could um put that on the forum so on the forum there's a lot of um things like this and that's where a lot of our features come from and if other people comment and say yeah that's a great thing we want with the engineers will work on it there have there has been recently a update on the um app which was to do with the wi-fi wan so you could manage the wi-fi wands within the app i believe that would be a very good um addition to the app for the this market as well so have a look at that um and yeah to switch sims yeah that's definitely one that could be added to it so put on the forum see what other people think about it too joel asked will the max transit series ever have usb for tethering so the max transit does not have a usb um on it um and we don't um really have a plan for that um if you want usb tethering you'll have to be looking at like the mbx and those kind of routers that have got the usb ports on them and obviously android phones as well on that um however for the usb tethering um our max adapter that we talked about that has ecm support that will be supported via our us the devices that have usb so that is one thing there as well uh marcelo asks please people have plans to launch a bo1 money core supporting the bands one three five seven and twenty eight um okay so the br1 mini core let's have a quick look at the specs on that um [Music] so if we go products uh bl1 so bl1 mini core and if you haven't checked out a new website go and check it out there's a lot of information there now a lot of new information so the br1 mini core currently there's just the us model that supports these bands so it's a category four 4 modem so the br1 mini core is designed as a a device for where connectivity is required but it's not necessary it doesn't have to be always on and not it doesn't really have the speed fusion that kind of stuff so it's it's more um lowering kind of installs as such if if you're after something that covers more bands um you need to look at a different category modem router so something that has category 6 or 12 modems in it something look more like the br1 mark ii um that'll have it um there okay so i think um that has covered it all for now so um if you do have any other questions um please head over to the forum and put them there we will share the links and things like that um and also the uh spec sheet for the ubr go that everyone has been asking for okay great well thank you very much everyone for attending today and um yeah we'll see you next time [Music] you"}

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "okay folks thanks for holding on i think we're ready to get started here my name is travis durk i'm a product manager here at peplink and if you haven't joined i've hosted several different webinars over the last several months to give you guys examples of how peplin can be used in different scenarios applications and today we're going to talk to you about how peplink can benefit branch edge network deployments so first and foremost as always peplink's main mission is to deliver unbreakable connectivity anytime anywhere we've got a couple pictures up here from we're real world deployments and these are obviously pretty unique applications we've got autonomous driving we've got some folks launching rockets out in the middle of nowhere those aren't necessarily branch edge deployments intuitively but the real message here is we can scale our technology up and down to fit whatever scenario and that that means the hardware can fit the cost and the budget of the deployment and that means the technology can scale up and down to meet the meet the demands and requirements of those customers now when you're going into enterprise branch deployments enterprise is the key word there and so customers want to be comfortable that you've got a solution that's going to fit into the needs of an enterprise and the expectations of an enterprise and so the best way that i find to make customers comfortable with that is for them to see other customers other peers doing the same thing and see how they like it so gartner has a peer insights site that i think is a great place to to help customers decide for themselves if if peplink is going to provide a good solution for their branch edge network you can go to this site you can check out all of our rankings you can see 46 reviews excellent excellent reviews you can see these are very large companies 1 to 3 billion 30 billion plus these are companies that don't deploy technology without doing a lot of due diligence and as you can see these are very happy customers so again when when you're trying to convince a customer that peplink is the right fit i really like to use this site as a as a testament to what pep links technology can deliver on but let's dive right into it i'm going to talk about five different features today and show you as well in our system how you can actually use these to to make branch edge deployments easy and make them work great so the very first one is our packet level speed fusion sd-wan this is peplink's magic that makes all kinds of benefits achievable and affordable for your customers the really important thing here is speedfusion is a packet level technology other players with lte routers they're not able to achieve these different levels of benefits and they're not able to protect applications with these different algorithms that we are again we're doing sd-wan at the packet level most other players that advertise sd-wan they're really not doing it at the packet level so they're not able to achieve these great benefits hot failover that's making sure that a phone call doesn't get dropped if your primary internet connection goes down users don't expect that right they get a failover router in place they're on a phone call they're on a zoom meeting internet goes down everything goes down in the office all their applications log out time out it fails over automatically right they get to go log back in they get to call the person back you know within a minute or two or three the office is back up and running on that backup connection but again it's not seamless it's not what customers are expecting and so speedfusion's able to deliver that seamless hot failover experience now we've also got wan smoothing which is an algorithm designed to protect real-time applications so voice video you can optimize those even in environments where you've got high packet loss inconsistent network performance we can smooth all that out and again optimize those applications and the other thing speedfusion can do is bandwidth bonding that's aggregating the throughput of multiple links even for a single file transfer single session again other other companies have routers with multiple wan inputs but one user one application one session is only able to use one connection or the other now if you've got a lot of users you can kind of spread them out and they're able to to utilize that but again a single file transfer a single application isn't going to be able to achieve the throughput of both links at one time it's only going to be able to use one or the other with competing solutions so again these are all different algorithms and strategies that speedfusion has in its tool belt and we're able to deploy these at an application level so that you can use the right mode to protect applications in the right way the other really cool thing that we can do with speedfusion's packet level sd-wan is we can combine private and public links so if you've got like private mpls or some other sort of private circuit it's usually a very expensive cost it's usually a linear cost model to get more bandwidth and so what we see customers using our speedfusion technology for is to augment and enhance those private circuits so you can take a public cable modem dsl line lte 5g and you can seamlessly insert that into the network so that you don't have to re-address all your sites you don't have to change anything on the existing deployment you're just able to inject that additional bandwidth even into that private network traffic that's going back and forth over the mpls we're able to reroute some of those packets over those public links in a secure encrypted tunnel and put it back into the private network on the other side the other cool feature that peplink has that really benefits in branch large branch deployments especially is our zero touch configuration so our in control 2 management system is able to provision all kinds of parameters for your devices globally and automatically so that all you have to do is ship a router to the location get somebody that there to install it and plug it into an internet connection and it's going to take all the settings that it needs so you don't have to sit there and hand touch each router you're able to distribute them quickly and scale up without any configuration bottlenecks so we'll show you how you can do some of those things in a little bit next up and this one pairs up with speedfusion as our application steering and optimization so application steering with our outbound policy manager you're able to carve out those different applications that are important to you and then send them to the right place so that they get protected in the right way again this can be done through our in control management system in a global and zero touch manner so we'll walk you through that as well show you how that works next up centralized remote visibility and troubleshooting if you've got locations all across the country or the world you're going to be having to support users in all kinds of locations where you're not able to actually check things out on your own you're gonna have to rely on remote tools to get you as far as possible so that you don't have to get local staff involved to help users with with miscellaneous problems so we'll show you how in control 2 has all kinds of tools to give you that visibility and and what tools are available for troubleshooting as well last but not least seamless network integration features so our routers have all kinds of ways to integrate with existing networks so that again even in those private network scenarios you're able to bring in a packet level sd-wan solution that is really easy to deploy and really not threatening to the customer customers really don't want to change up their whole network just to deploy some new technology they just want to make their existing system work better is how they see it often so with our different integration features in our router we're able to achieve that really clean really seamless integration with existing networks so that you can give them those benefits without scaring them away with a whole bunch of extra work so those are the five features again we'll do a demo towards the end of this and walk you through how to how to actually implement each of these first up i'm going to show you some of our devices that fit nicely into branch edge scenarios now a few challenges that people see often when they're deploying branch edge networks is protecting application performance at every location oftentimes each location might have a little bit different mix of connections and so you need to create policies that are going to work organization wide to protect those applications at each site and again legacy network infrastructure it's just really hard to get away from it really really takes the agility away from businesses if they have to rely on 30 60 90 day installation times for for private circuits that's just not feasible and it's just not compatible with today's business environment businesses need to be here today and there tomorrow and so with peplink and our sd-wan technology we're able to utilize that existing private infrastructure but liberate you from it so that you can operate as quickly and efficiently as you need to wherever you need to so here's a lineup of a good suite of branch edge devices that would fit into just about any budget so at the far left we've got our balance 20x it's 399 msrp and that includes an lte connection in there so it's a it's got a hardwired connection so you get almost a gigabit connection on there it's rated for up to 900 megabits per second so any modern docsis 3.1 connection or fiber to the prim this router is going to be able to handle that kind of throughput and again it's got a built-in lte radio so it's already got that failover box checked as well so for 399 you get a heck of a value to get whatever your smallest branch look sites look like this could even be a home user a work from home scenario this has great wi-fi built in so again it's gonna it's gonna work in all kinds of small environments moving up the ladder we've got our balance 310x this is just a bigger version of the same concept really it's faster throughput so you can get a couple of those high-speed wired connections in there so you've got three different ethernet ones so you can get maybe your private mpls and you can get a couple gig fiber or cable connections in into this router this one also has built-in lte so again you've got that failover connectivity right out of the box next up is our hd4 mbx it's real similar in capability to the 310x but it's really more focused on the cellular connectivity side so oftentimes what we're seeing more and more is companies want to be able to stand up branches without any wireline connectivity for as long as they need to sometimes it's just while they're waiting for that wire line circuit to get installed and sometimes it's more of a nomadic application where they might be moving from city to city or location to location and so they need to rely on those lte connections as their primary link so the hd 4mbx has four different lte connections in it as well as the capability to plug in wired or or other wireless technologies like satellite that may have its own links but you're able to harness the bandwidth of all those different links and manage the utilization of them so that you're using lte before you're using satellite and you're able to deliver again that seamless fast experience to your your wireless branches so they can behave just like a branch would that has a wired connection now at the top of the stack we've got the sdx and the epx these are modular routers that can be outfitted to include lte radios if you need so these would work work great at a little bit larger branch location so they've got built-in 10 gig fiber interfaces built-in ethernet lans built-in ethernet lans and then you can again populate that modular slot with lte radios fiber connections ethernet connections whatever mix you need for each of those locations these also work great as head-end devices so you can kind of roll up or aggregate the connections from several of your branches into your larger corporate network so we'll talk about that in just a second here as well i should note the pricing on here is all in us dollars msrp so those of you joining outside of the us those are us dollar prices some other options in our branch edge portfolio is wi-fi wi-fi is absolutely expected and required and it needs to work really great really well really seamlessly for users right they don't want to know the difference between plugging into an ethernet jack and being uh connected over wi-fi so we've got a suite of different wi-fi access points that are going to fit into whatever deployment scenario your customer's looking to to do on the left we've got our ap1 ac mini this is an 80211 ac wave 2 product in the middle we've got our brand new ap1ax this is wi-fi 6 or 802.11ax just came out and it's a heck of a price point 299 for a wi-fi 6 enterprise access point it's pretty hard to beat that in the market right now we've also got our ac wave this one's not wave 2 we've got our 11 ac ap1 enterprise and then we've also got a companion product here called our air probe this is a diagnostic tool to help you do automated throughput testing of your wi-fi it's got spectrum analysis capabilities all kinds of on-demand and scheduled tools that you can utilize to run into problems before your users do so you can really get a user level view of your networks remotely without having to be there without having to occupy anybody else's time you can think of this as a a wi-fi client built just for testing your network and evaluating the the environment i should note as well that all of our a all of our wi-fi products support seamless roaming so we've got standards-based seamless roaming that you can you can enable on these so it's a it's a really really feature-rich wi-fi option for any enterprise deployment and it gives you a lot of integration benefits that we'll show you when we get into the troubleshooting and last but not least switches everybody's going to need switches at their offices and so we've got a whole lineup of 8 16 24 and 48 port switches that deliver poe for for high demand devices and again our switches give you that that advantage of that visibility that centralized management and control so that you're able to map policies from the router to the switch and get visibility down to the client port and and wi-fi access point level so you can really map out who and where devices are across your entire global deployment again pricing on here is all us dollar msrp so how do we put this all together if you want to speed fusion enable your branch sites it sounds great right we want to add more bandwidth we want to save cost we want to scale bandwidth in an efficient manner what business isn't going to say yes to that right but the how is where people start getting confused or start running into problems often so that's the really nice thing with speedfusion is it's really easy to integrate this into your existing network and it gives you a migration path that you can do as many or as few sites at a time as your you and your customer are comfortable with so here we've got several remote sites and then we've got our headquarters site over on the left so at the headquarter site your customer almost guaranteed has a lot of other network appliances deployed already right they've got maybe a security firewall they've got some sort of maybe larger routing route router doing the enterprises routing for it there's usually a lot of these network components in place already when you get there so using some of the tools that we'll show you in a little bit you're able to integrate into those existing networks using common routing protocols or using our proprietary drop-in mode to seamlessly insert speedfusion into these networks once that's set up your remote sites are able to phone home to the the peplink appliance on site and get that speed fusion benefit and again make that network experience seamless so if it's a private network being bonded with with a public network the the larger corporate network isn't going to know the difference they're not going to be able to identify any any change in in that they're just going to have packets flowing a lot faster than they used to again this gives you the ability to do incremental deployments as well so you can cut as many sites over at a time as you want you can start with one site and ramp up as fast as your customers are comfortable with we also support network technologies like ipsec so if you wanted to put pep link in the middle of it right away and then just migrate to speed fusion you can keep the remote equipment on whatever vendors there and use that standards-based ipsec to get you connected back to the headquarters and then again roll out those edge peplink devices to speed fusion enable each location one at a time so with that we're going to dive into the demo here again we've got five different items that we're going to cover here so if you give me just a second i will switch screens and get over to our live and control system so okay folks hopefully you're seeing the in control window if not light me up in the q a but i'm going to assume everything's good on your side okay so first up we're going to talk about speed fusion it's really nice because speed fusion is integrated into our management system so it's really easy to deploy something that often it can be a pretty complex network if we go up here under pet vpn speed fusion we can click on configuration and i've deployed two profiles here i've deployed a connection to azure and i've deployed a connection to google cloud so we've got two nodes uh two virtual nodes up in the cloud that are homed where applications that are important to us are located and then we've got several branch locations here around the country and world so i'll open one of these up and just show you how we did this it's really straightforward so if we click on add i'll just show you how it looks start to finish so right away you get to choose a topology of of your vpn network so you can do star fully or point to point fully meshed is obviously the most redundant you can get usually that's pretty complicated to deploy but we automate it with our tool here but we'll go with star that's usually the most common topology we see now right away you get to choose which device is your hub which one is going to be in the middle of that star so you can just choose whichever one you want it's going to automatically populate the parameters you need and then you choose which locations you want to connect to it [Music] now i've already got these locations connected this way so i'm getting some errors here but we'll jump back into the other ones so you can see the rest of it so the last the last page you don't have to do anything here necessarily it's going to automatically populate the settings needed to get up and running and connected but you've got the ability to turn on some of these different features and algorithms that we've got here so you can customize this as much as you want but to get things up and running you just have to click next i'm not going to push finish here because this is already set up if we check the live status you can see all our different nodes each of their locations and if we look into one of these groups [Music] we can check our offices out you can see those connections to azure and google cloud are there and connected if we go into the router itself through in control's remote web admin look under speed fusion you can see those profiles showed up and were pushed down from in control automatically so i didn't have to touch these routers to deploy this vpn network i just had to click through those that wizard that you saw everything got connected nice and easy so next up we'll talk about zero touch provisioning of all kinds of different network settings so you can see we've got routers deployed around the globe here we've got an office in paris we've got an office in minneapolis we've got an office in san jose and then again we've got our cloud locations so we've got all the equipment in view here but if we want to create some policies that are going to provision enterprise wide it's really straightforward and we've got a lot of different tools we can use to do different things so firewalls are a good example we can create firewall rules and we can choose which devices these are going to go to so we can just make them go to all the devices by default or you can use tags to choose which policies go to which routers so maybe your europe routers need a different firewall policy than your us routers do that's really easy to manage and maintain here so that anytime a region or or a different location needs those updates you're able to do it in one spot and have it automatically update everywhere else that it's appropriate so i'm going to make a europe firewall policy i'm going to say the default rule is deny for outbound i'm going to add a rule we've got a great feature in in control that lets you choose region as a destination so we can say let's say france germany uk and united states just as an example we're going to allow traffic to those locations so if your users get a spoof email that brings them to some malicious site that's hosted in some some country this rule is going to protect those users from going to that site and similarly on the inbound we can create those types of rules we can enable all the features we want and again maintain these centrally okay so if we see we see that i i specifically said only deploy this to the devices with these tags if we go back to the dashboard we can just kind of check our work here and make sure the system is doing what we wanted so here we can see the tags eu and then we've got some us ones so this router this balance sdx that we've got deployed in paris you can see last configuration applied a few seconds ago so this router has already taken those configuration parameters that we just provisioned over here now if there were multiple routers in in with that eu tag all of those routers would have updated respectively as well we've got some other smaller features that work in that same zero tr zero touch central provisioning way like group networks so if you've got a bank of servers or or different internal systems that you want to be able to make policies make simple policies for you can include all of those ip ranges in here and then you can use those as destinations or sources for your firewall rules or your your outbound network policies similarly we can deploy vlans this way so let's say we've got some ip cameras at all of our locations we can give them a vlan id in this case i'm going to deploy them to everything this this is important too because this is relevant with the routers and the switches you've got the ability to control if you want these vlans to push to both or one or the other and since these are cameras i don't really want them to route to other vlans i don't want them to be able to speak anywhere but but the vlan they're on so they can kind of remain private and secure so now every location in my whole global deployment is going to suddenly have that vlan so that you can provision switch ports and things like that to to get your cameras up and connected privately again if we want to check our work here you can see all those devices just took that vlan except for this air probe but that's a that's a different product again you've got just nice easy tools to give you that that confidence that the settings that you're pushing out there are actually taking actually making it to the end so you get that confirmation from every device we can even see that in here we can see the timestamp last configuration applied a minute ago so you've got records of it you've got proof that your configurations are actually going out and you know when and and where they took and you know where they didn't if for some reason they don't take somewhere you've got an easy way to trace that back now you can also provision ssids so you can provision your wi-fi globally so we can turn that on we can create a guest network so that every location has a guest wi-fi ssid with the same user experience you can configure that however you want again we've got layer 2 isolation for security again on private around for guest wi-fi that's a great feature to turn on fast transition again these are the the standards based fast roaming features you can set client individual client speed limits aggregate what ssid speed limits you've got firewall capabilities per ssid vlan tagging tons of features tons of features to give you really flexible wi-fi deployments and also we've got captive portal in here as well so you can actually apply a really rich customized captive portal to these guest networks and for your internal enterprise networks obviously you don't need to do that but again you can use tags and provision these globally so that they take whichever location you want them to and you can update them centrally and not have to touch each one now there's lots of other zero touch provisioning capabilities like firmware policies so we can push whatever firmware to whichever products we want we can push it now we can schedule it lots of the basic day-to-day administration stuff that you have to do on these networks that's all obviously covered within in control as well there's tons of features we could go on and on about all the different zero touch options you've got in here i think the last one we'll show you is just the device ip settings so when you go to deploy a network globally there's a lot of legwork that that's involved you've got ip schemes that need to be maintained and you've got all kinds of settings that need to be adjusted for each site and this applies on the lan and the lan side so you've got you've got the ability to customize all all those settings i'm going to switch over here to a spreadsheet let me just make sure that you guys are seeing that i think you should be seeing this still in any case i've got all my router serial numbers here and then i've just listed out the networks so i've populated this with unique address unique subnets for each network so you can see there's all kinds of different settings and parameters that you can set in a customized but again zero touch manner so i can just download this as a csv and then you can copy and paste that into this little window here which i've already done click import and you'll see all your routers take that unique addressing and those customized settings that you've you've provisioned so here we've got our 0.1 subnet on this router this one is 2.1 again that's that's customized just as we specified in our master sheet so really easy to configure those unique site unique site settings that might be needed to really iron out your global deployment but again pretty straightforward to do that in a centralized manner so that covers the zero touch configuration for the most part or i should say it transitions or overlaps with the next topic here the next topic is application steering and optimization so our up on policy helps tie in this capability so i've got a global default routing policy that i've created here we'll step you through how we can protect different applications that are important to your users so we've got a rule here for zoom and so all i've done here under the destination from in control there's a software as a service option so you can choose whichever application you want to route and then all you have to do is choose the algorithm in this case i've chosen the priority algorithm so i'm preferring that anything any zoom traffic is going to get protected through this pet vpn or speed fusion tunnel that's going to azure so i'm going to route all my zoom traffic through azure and then that speed fusion tunnel is going to have the appropriate policies that i want to protect that traffic so maybe that's hot failover for zoom obviously you'd probably want to use at least hot failover uh if not when smoothing to protect and optimize that video traffic if you start getting some network congestion not necessarily outages but just subpar performance so again you've got the ability here to prioritize and steer different applications to different locations and again you can provision this globally another rule here we've got office 365. we're also telling that to go to azure through that speed fusion tunnel and we've got a g suite rule here so we're going to route anything destined for g suite through our tunnel our speed fusion tunnel to google cloud where we've got a pep link fusion hub i don't think i touched on it earlier but fusionhub is our speedfusion virtual machine so you can deploy speedfusion endpoints anywhere you need to on virtually any cloud platform out there we've got compatibility with azure aws google cloud um [Music] vulture and digitalocean all kinds of different different platforms in the cloud but it also works with local hypervisors so if you've got a vmware stack or a hyper-v stack in some of your critical locations you can use the the speed fusion fusion hub to tie up connectivity to that so that you can route application traffic in and out of that location with that speed fusion packet level sd-wan the other really cool thing about the the fusion hub is you can embed that again in private networks so again there's just tons of flexibility when you look at integrating with an employee enterprise network again if we look at our router over here we can see we've got those three policies provisioned here and let's just say i don't want that zoom rule anymore we'll delete that see if it's pushed yet yep again just just like we wanted and again you can see that rule's gone so that's gone globally right now because that's that was the scope of that rule so really easy to just change up the rules globally or as wide or as focused as you want okay next up we're going to talk about remote troubleshooting so i think the first one to show you is the client list because it really shows how the integration pays off with with our different products so when you start stacking up public routers peppling switches public access points it gives you deeper and deeper visibility into the network and it makes it easier and easier to do that because it's all centralized and visible from one place so here we've got this device called an air probe again this is our wi-fi monitoring tool but i made a mistake i shipped this router out and i'm not sure which label got put on which box i don't know if this showed up in europe or if this showed up in the us so i want to just figure out where this thing is plugged in i see it's online which is great so i can just grab its ip address here we can click on that client list and i can just dump that ip address in and it's going to tell me okay yeah it's in in paris it's connected to this router which is connected to this switch so you've got really good visibility you know exactly which vlan it's on you know which which port it's plugged in you've got all this visibility on that device just by dropping an ip address into a search box now you can obviously just look globally and see all the devices that are on there but you're able to search by mac address device name ip address vlan you're also going to get the wi-fi signal strength again this is rolled up deployment wide it's not just one site or another site you've got this really centralized scale visibility so that you can drill into wherever you need to some other cool things you can do for troubleshooting is you've got some remote tools so if we just want to want to run a ping from minneapolis to a location we can choose which which connection we want to use maybe we want to ping into that camera subnet and just make sure our camera is there or maybe we want to ping out and just check the performance of our cellular connection so this is going to initiate that ping from that remote router in minneapolis and it's going to send us that output so you're getting the real time the the round trip time from that remote router to whatever destination and then it's just displayed up here so you don't have to log into any routers you've got that tool right at your disposal and again you've got trace route remote assistance you've got lots of different different tools here you can reboot them you can factory default them if you need to if somebody got in there and did something that they shouldn't have you can do that and reprovision them again lots of great tools of course when we talk about remote troubleshooting we can't skip over remote web admin you can click a button log right into a remote router and this doesn't re require any inbound port forwarding on that router so if you've got a router that's on a cellular connection that doesn't have a public ip inbound no problem remote web admin will still work now the other thing to show you here is you can see this cellular connection is not working it's stuck at obtaining ip address and so there's there's a few ways we can watch for this type of thing one is a little bit hidden by default if we click on this gear down here you can click on this disconnected wan icon setting so let's say i just wanna i want the system to just give me a visual cue if any wan is down for more than five minutes so here you can see if it's good it's gonna it's not gonna have a red box around it if it's bad it's gonna have a red box around it and so here you can see disconnected so we're gonna we've got a green one that's good we've got a red one that's bad so again just really common sense indicators to clue you in just via your eyeballs to little problems that might be out there on your network now if you want to get more proactive of course there's lots of alerting capabilities as well so if we go under settings and notifications you can create as many profiles as you want for notifications and that allows you to have different behaviors for different notifications maybe you need to alert different groups or different departments for different activities so you can create as many profiles as you need you can have silent windows so again maybe an eu deployment you want to alert staff in in europe and maybe for the us you want to alert staff in the u.s so you can just parse that out by tag and then you can say okay if the routers go offline for more than five minutes let me know if you've got a wham that goes offline for more than five so again you can you can have more proactive or reactive alerts depending on on what the priorities are but again lots of tools there to help you troubleshoot and stay on top of your deployment remotely last but not least we'll talk about network integration so if we look at our network our router there's a few different tools we've got here to make integrating pep link into existing networks really easy so first up is our drop-in mode so drop-in mode has been a pebbling feature from day one and that's our ability to put the router into a transparent bridge mode and so the router is going to just take the traffic in from the ethernet wind and bridge it through to the ethernet lan and it can either use a public ip in that range or a private ip if it's a an mpls network but it's gonna it's gonna partici it's gonna be a member of that that existing network but again in a transparent bridge mode so it's just going to pass traffic through so the existing firewalls aren't going to really realize that that device is participating and all your security policies are going to still be valid if we enter look under network settings you can see right here we've got i clicked on the wrong button drop-in mode so we just went to our untagged lan we're going to enable drop-in mode and so we're going to say we want to bridge ethernet one so again if you've got an mpls deployment you can put the pep link in between that carrier provided mpls router or handoff and your existing site firewall or maybe you just have a switch maybe there isn't any firewalling at each branch depending on how your your network's laid out but in any case you can just put this device in line and then we're able to actually inject the bandwidth either through speed fusion or load balancing for those those connections on that on that path through lan and we're also able to have our own vlans that maybe didn't exist before so again you can run additional services like cameras or phones that maybe weren't present in the original network those devices can use network network address translation so that they're still able to utilize all that speed fusion capability on the outbound traffic so drop in mode makes it really easy to integrate with existing deployments public or private networks the other thing we see people do is use our our different routing protocol support to integrate speed fusion endpoints with the existing network so you can use ospf to connect to a an enterprise router and then you can choose which networks to share from the speed fusion side to the the other ospf router that's already on site so you can share all the remote networks if you want or if there's specific networks you want to you wanna advertise and others you don't you can choose which networks get advertised upstream to the those peer routers that you're talking to so again you can you can embed this pep link into an existing network pair it up with an existing router and so that makes talking between a speed fusion pep link site and a legacy site without speed fusion or peplink really seamless we've also got bgp support so same concept just different routing protocol and for those of you that have been watching over the years our bgc bgp support is growing so we're getting a lot more features on here every every firmware version we're adding more and more to our bgp capabilities so if you didn't see something there before take another look because firmware 810 just came out and there's again new features like bfd included in in our bgp stack so that covers all of the features i wanted to talk about today so i'm going to just open up the q a and just see what kind of questions we've got so feel free to throw more up there okay first one i see does the throughput of the balance 20x i think okay so is the throughput of the balance 20x available when all features are enabled vpn security um so speed fusion throughput on the balance 20x is relatively low so that i think caps out at uh i'll look this up quick um much much lower than 900 megs per second regardless so in that in that scenario you you might not be speed fusion protecting all of your traffic you might just be protecting your voice over ip or your zoom traffic or something like that so balance 20x is great for speed fusion protecting specific applications but it probably isn't a great fit when you need to tunnel everything or protect everything at that site you might want to move up to the 310x which has i think 500 or 600 megs of encrypted throughput capability on that router okay i see another question what if remote units using a pep wave modem need to communicate to our cloud is there a cloud solution for this use case so i assume that's like a some sort of private cloud or or something along those lines and so the answer to that is almost always yes you know again we can use our fusion hub virtual appliance so that you can put that inside whatever cloud node or platform or hypervisor that's important to your customer and i've seen fusion hub run on just about anything anywhere again we talked about the big ones vmware esxi hyper-v but i've seen it run on nutanix and some other kind of more niche uh or up-and-coming hypervisor platforms so again really broad compatibility with with fusionhub and that makes connecting it to different clouds and applications really straightforward see another question is the ap1ax 2x2 or 4x4 so that's 4x4 multi-user mimo again that's wi-fi six so that's a pretty bad machine for 2.99 i see another question about support plans through the partner and channel right now our support structure flows right back up the chain the way the way the purchase was done so customers can reach out to their point of purchase they can reach up to the distributor and they can reach up to pep link and so we we work together with those partners that are familiar with the deployments to make sure that the most knowledgeable people are involved in that support conversation to make sure that all the deployment details are understood and troubleshooting is done in the most efficient way so the support structure really hasn't changed recently so i see a request to demonstrate some of the speed fusion capabilities um there's lots of video content out there right now that i think more directly demonstrates the the capabilities of each individual speed fusion mode or algorithm but i can definitely take that as a as a follow-up to work on more video content to help show how that application protection really works and demonstrate the benefits in in a real world manner so again there's plenty of video content out there to show some of those but i think that's something we can continue to improve and demonstrate more more directly there see another question about cli or ssh management access yes this is a great question because there is just like our remote web admin there is remote command line capabilities and so that is available to remotely use the command line of our peplink router in it for products that have serial capability we're able to remotely interface to the serial device that's connected to that so maybe you want to be able to remotely manage a an existing cisco router or firewall or another vendor switch you can utilize that serial capability to connect to the console port of that device and then relay that through our cloud system so that you've got remote secure centralized access to those those serial ports or those clis of again the pep link routers as well i think we will have an upcoming webinar to look more directly at what some of those remote cli and out-of-band management capabilities are so i think that will be either next month or the following so stay tuned for that another question can you access a peplink device without the use of in control yes you can so you can access that locally through the lan just username and password or if you've got more robust enterprise access control enabled and then you can also access it remotely from the wan if you so enable that um you can enable remote lan side access you can just log into it from whatever ip address and port you've provisioned for the the web admin i'll show you that real quick here too actually there's some good features on that so right now this stuff is being managed by in control centrally so again great example of how to do this so that you don't end up with one site configured different than another site but you can see there's lots of different authentication options here what i wanted to show you is if i enable that web admin access to lan and when then it gives you some options like firewalls or white lists so that you can open it to the lan side but it's only for only allowed from particular ip addresses so that gives you kind of a balance of security and remote administration but if you're doing a global deployment man i don't know why you wouldn't use in control i know it costs money but it will save you that money in one remote problem at a remote site it's really it's really hard to imagine deploying a global global system without having some sort of central management involved there to to make it easy just got one other question here that i'm reading and then i think we'll wrap it up okay so it took me a second to understand the question here but i think i get it our speed our full speed fusion bonding capabilities available for lte links that are connected through an ethernet lan port instead of using the built-in cellular interfaces do you get the same benefits of bonding in that scenario so i think what the customer or what the person's asking here is let's say i've got a rack mount router in the middle of my building right i'm probably not going to get great lte connectivity in there so what if i what if i use like a br1 mini and put that on the far outside edge of the building or maybe maybe get an outdoor router put it up on the roof and connect that into a lan port am i is the bonding performance going to be about the same so assuming that you've got the same level of connectivity you there's no penalty applied or or to either scenario you can use an lte connection over ethernet or or one of the built-in native interfaces just the same the only thing you're going to lose is a little bit of visibility on the signal strength and some of those things but again you're not losing anything in terms of you know out of the box capability it's going to work well either it's going to work about the same either way all right folks two minutes left i think we're we're wrapped up on questions here thanks so much again for joining and reach out to your peplink account manager or your peplink partner if you've got questions on pricing or any of the models that we've shown you here today thanks again and take care [Music]"}

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "next up centralized remote visibility and troubleshooting if you've got locations all across the country or the world you're going to be having to support users in all kinds of locations where you're not able to actually check things out on your own you're gonna have to rely on remote tools to get you as far as possible so that you don't have to get local staff involved to help users with with miscellaneous problems so we'll show you how in control 2 has all kinds of tools to give you that visibility and and what tools are available for troubleshooting as well okay next up we're going to talk about remote troubleshooting so i think the first one to show you is the client list because it really shows how the integration pays off with with our different products so when you start stacking up public routers coupling switches pep link access points it gives you deeper and deeper visibility into the network and it makes it easier and easier to do that because it's all centralized and visible from one place so here we've got this device called an air probe again this is our wi-fi monitoring tool but i made a mistake i shipped this router out and i'm not sure which label got put on which box so i don't know if this showed up in europe or if this showed up in the u.s so i want to just figure out where this thing is plugged in i see it's online which is great so i can just grab its ip address here [Music] we can click on that client list and i can just dump that ip address in and it's going to tell me okay yeah it's in in paris it's connected to this router which is connected to this switch so you've got really good visibility you know exactly which vlan it's on you know which which port it's plugged in you've got all this visibility on that device just by dropping an ip address into a search box now you can obviously just look globally and see all the devices that are on there but you're able to search by mac address device name ip address vlan you're also going to get the wi-fi signal strength again this is rolled up deployment wide it's not just one site or another site you've got this really centralized scale visibility so that you can drill into wherever you need to some other cool things you can do for troubleshooting is you've got some remote tools so if we just want to want to run a ping from minneapolis to a location we can choose which which connection we want to use maybe we want to ping into that camera subnet and just make sure our camera is there or maybe we want to ping out and just check the performance of our cellular connection this is going to initiate that ping from that remote router in minneapolis and it's going to send us that output so you're getting the real time the round trip time from that remote router to whatever destination and then it's just displayed up here so you don't have to log into any routers you've got that tool right at your disposal and again you've got trace route remote assistance you've got lots of different different tools here you can reboot them you can factory default them if you need to if somebody got in there and did something that they shouldn't have you can do that and reprovision them again lots of great tools of course when we talk about remote troubleshooting we can't skip over remote web admin you can click a button log right into a remote router and this doesn't re require any inbound port forwarding on that router so if you've got a router that's on a cellular connection that doesn't have a public ip inbound no problem remote web admin will still work now the other thing to show you here is you can see the cellular connection it's not working it's it's stuck at obtaining ip address and so there's there's a few ways we can watch for this type of thing one is a little bit hidden by default if we click on this gear down here you can click on this disconnected wan icon setting so let's say i just wanna i want the system to just give me a visual cue if any wan is down for more than five minutes so here you can see if it's good it's gonna it's not gonna have a red box around it if it's bad it's gonna have a red box around it and so here you can see disconnected so we're gonna we've got a green one that's good we've got a red one that's bad again just really common sense indicators to clue you in just via your eyeballs to little problems that might be out there on your network no if you want to get more proactive of course there's lots of alerting capabilities as well so if we go under settings and notifications you can create as many profiles as you want for notifications and that allows you to have different behaviors for different notifications maybe you need to alert different groups or different departments for different activities so you can create as many profiles as you need you can have silent windows so again maybe an eu deployment you want to alert staff in in europe and maybe for the us you want to alert staff in the u.s so you can just parse that out by tag and then you can say okay if the routers go offline for more than five minutes let me know if you've got a win that goes offline for more than five so again you can you can have more proactive or reactive alerts depending on on what the priorities are but again lots of tools there to help you troubleshoot and stay on top of your deployment remotely [Music] you"}

be covering four topics the first three relate to the gui of the device and the fourth is about our maritime pep link certified engineer so the first section is about the configuration of the device we will cover vlans ssid settings outbound policies and file rules as well as applying a speed limit and user groups the second section is about gathering helpful information from your device we'll cover cover things like data usage reports active sessions and speed fusion information lastly we will sorry thirdly we will demonstrate speed fusion and show you the difference between using speed fusion and not using speed fusion so i'll do that live and show you the difference with the the webinar of what speed fusion does lastly we'll cover some examples of good and bad answers we've received for the maritime pipeline certified engineer exam so today's webinar is aimed more at the onboard operator so we're dealing primarily with the local gui please feel free to ask questions as we go along and we can go into more depth if it is required so first let's have a look at some of our products that are more commonly found in the maritime sector pebbling have many routers suited to maritime market this is just a short example of a kind of a sizing comparison and recommendation for a super yacht we've also got ip rated routers like the ip67 hd2 and hd4 our products don't stop at the router we also have full solutions for onboard connectivity including our own range of switches wifi access points antennas and then the sim injector as well last week we launched our new website there's a dedicated section for the for maritime go and check it out some of you may have noticed the new images on our website they're designed to provide you an overview of how our solutions can fit into a maritime installation so in this example we've got two mbxs one is a master and one is a high available availability slave we've also got a br1 power to provide power to the units this allows us to monitor the power remotely we've then got an sd switch and access points so that's all on the boat then off the boat and a data center we've got an sdx connected to the internet so the idea is to connect them using speed fusion bonding to create a single reliable and fast internet connection between the vessel and the data center so we've got some other examples here so on the left this is an example showing two different setups that were offered for the same vessel so the one on the left is using uh two hd4 indexes it's uh very similar to the previous example um and then the second option for this client was utilizing an epx so the epx obviously gives you a lot more options and connectivity but also both the epx and the mdx have upgradable modems then on the right we have also got a setup for a sailor which uses an hd2 dome and then a balanced 580 below dx the hd2 dome is installed up the mast single ethernet network cable down to below decks and then use the sum injector to power up the dome and provide the sims to the dome we've then also got an sd switch and access points uh the one below that is a similar setup for a modi but with an hd4 mbx located up the mast nice and close to antennas sd switch some injector and access points throughout the vessel so today's session has operated more as a more at the on-board operator if you want to find out more about selecting and installing equipment please view my previous webinars which are available on the forum so in a second i'm going to share my screen with you and we're going to go through the configurations for this demo i'm using a category 18 hd 4mbx and i've got two active sim cards in it i've also got my home internet which is connected via ethernet wham the first thing we're going to go through is the basic configuration the device and then we'll cover the vlan and ssid settings outbound policy and file rules as well as applying speed onto user groups we'll also briefly look at the ap controller okay so you now should be able to see my screen and the interface of the hd4mbx can you confirm that you can see the hd4mdx interface there just give me a thumbs up if you can see it okay perfect okay so this is the the dashboard on the um hd4 mbx so this tells you which ones you have so currently i have got the ethernet way in here so when one that's my network cable which goes to my home internet and then i've got two sim cards active if we click on the cellular details we get a lot more information about a particular cellular wan so you can see what bands have been used so what frequency the signal strengths all that kind of information further down you can specify things like data roaming lte only you can also click on these question marks and quite often the question mark's got some hidden settings there so for example this one here we can click here and you can manually select carrier i'm not going to do that now because i would disconnect that cellular way it also does things like the cellular frequency so if you know cellular frequency doesn't perform very well in a particular area you can disable that frequency and that cellular modem won't connect to it another feature here that a lot of people don't realize is this little question mark here on the right hand side this one can be used to reset a modem so if the network operator says to you that you need to reboot your router you don't actually have to reboot the whole router you can just reboot that individual modem so if you click on that and then click here and then you confirm that and click yes that will reboot that modem and you don't need to click save and apply at the bottom for that particular command you can just cancel out of that window and then you'll see that here the modem will go through resetting and it'll reset it's just that individual mode okay so i'm using a our latest film which is 8.1.0 it is going to be going generally available very soon um if you follow the forum you'll have the info about that there okay so the first thing we are going to configure is a vlan so if we go to network now we will see that there's just the physical untagged lan that's by default there the default one is 192.168.50.1 so you can change that to whatever suits your network design i'm just going to leave it as a default one for this demo so what i'm going to do now is create a second and third network which will be the vlans so the ip address i'm going to use here is uh 192.168.51.1 so i'm just going one up one upload up on the second to last auckland this network i am going to call crew and i'm going to give it the vlan idea 51. i'm just matching it to be the same as the second to last oclet of the ip address so the name of the vlan can be whatever you want i'm just going to call it crew so for the vlan id you can you use your own convention um but as i said i'd like to use my uh the sigma class operator of the uh of the vlan ip address so the vlan ids need to be added to any network switches between the router and in devices if you're using osc switches this can be easily applied to multiple switches from and control so interview lan routing enables devices on different subnets to be able to access each other if you need a your network to be more secure you can disable this and it stops devices on uh different vlans from being able to access each other [Music] so if the dhcp server is enabled you need to enter some settings in there so we're going to create a range there from 10 2.100 for the dns servers i like to disable the auto assign dns server setting and manually add dns servers so for this example i'm going to use 1.1.1 and 1.1.0.0 so that just means that clients that are connected to your wi-fi will get the same dns servers assigned to them when they connect to the network so now we're going to save that network i'm just going to create a second one now which will be 52 and we'll call this one guest so give that a similar dhcp range and also disable the dns there as well the auto dns function okay so i'm going to save that now so we've now got the two vlans and the physical land there so now what i'm going to do is apply these changes so those changes have been applied so we now have three lands on this router one physical untagged lan and then the two vlans okay so the next thing we're going to have a look at now is the ap controller so so the ap our ap controller is able to centrally manage pip wave aps on your network this allows you to push ssids out to multiple aps from one central device it also allows you to change passwords from the same central location you can also update firmware using our firmware packs i'm going to start by enabling the external ap controller and adding an access point to it so click here and i'm going to change to approve list and i'm going to add the serial number of the access point i want to add so i'm going to save that click apply the access point that i am adding is currently not powered on so i'm just going to give it power so that it boots up and then within a minute or so it should be adopted yeah so this ap will automatically found on the network and be adopted by the nbx if the access point is already booted up it might take longer so if you want the ap to be adopted quicker save the serial number first and then connect the access point to the network while the ap has been adopted let's create some ssids and link them to the vlans we have created so the default ssid is already present here it consists of pip link or pip wave an underscoring is followed by the last four characters of the serial number the password for the access point is the last eight characters of the um mac address so for this one it's already entered there by default that's just the default setting so when you boot up an access point a router if you can't physically connect to it you can connect to a wi-fi that way so next i'm going to create an ssid so this one i am just going to call crew um and we want it to be always on you can create a schedule um and link it to an ssid under the systems tab so you can have the ssids turn on and off automatically at different times of the day so for the vlan i'm going to link this ssid to the true vlan for the password i'm going to select wpa2 personal and i'm just going to put password as the password obviously don't use that in real life this is just for the demo okay so the other settings generally you can leave them as they are you can use fast transition if you want but with some older devices you might notice some issues with that like for example certain printers won't connect to your network if you have a fast transition enabled but that's per ssid so you can create a separate ssid just for printers and things like that if you need to so i'm going to click save and apply on that let's see if the access point has been adopted yep so the access point that i connected has been registered and the configuration has been synchronized and applied to it so that access point we originally added has been adopted by the mbx so let's go back to the wireless ssid sorry the settings here we go and let's create a second ssid and we're going to call this one guest we're going to link it to the guest vlan and again we are going to create a very weak password of password and we're going to save that okay so now we can click apply changes and that those two ssids will be pushed out both by the onboard wi-fi the mdx and by the access point i have connected to it as i've connected the access point directly to the mdx i won't i don't need to create any vlan settings further down on other switches on the network okay so the next thing we are going to look at is the outbound and outbound policies and file rules so let's go to the outbound policies it needs to be found under advanced and then outbound policies so this is the default one that you'll find there you can click on add rule and that's our screen for adding the rules so outcome policies determine how traffic is handled and which one is used by particular traffic or device rules are matched from the top to the bottom if a rule is matched the rest of the rules are ignored for that particular traffic so let's have a look at some of the different options available so the source is where the traffic is coming from again these question marks here to explain it what is being done by a particular rule in that so the source can be an individual device that will be an ip address or a mac address you can select a ip network uh so that's the whole subnet so like the vlans we create or you can select a client's associated ssid so that's just for clients that connect via wi-fi to a particular ssid not the devices physically connected to the network so if you select any that's going to be any device on your network so i'm just going to create a rule here and call it all to speed fusion so track from anywhere on my network going to anywhere so again with the destination that's where the traffic is going on the internet not not which one it's using to get there but where it's going on the network so you can do domain name things like that generally you'll just select any for that as well so protocol you can select what protocol is going there so for example smtp or syslog you can select that just a particular um just a particular protocol goes over when so we have eight algorithms available to us each one has a different purpose and a different way it operates so weighted balance is used for load balancing across different wands and it's done via session so for example um i'll just get rid of all to speed fusion it's not going to be that just now but this is the weighted balance uh to say all the cellular ones are available so we can just move all the the ethernet winds to zero and the usb and the wi-fi ones as well so what's going to happen here is that the traffic is going to be disputed on a session based across those cellular internet connections if you just want it to be a particular network say the crew vlan we could add that here so prove elan is 192.168.51.0 and that'll mean any traffic from the crew vlan will then be forced to use that rule at the very bottom there is an option of when no connection is available um if you select drop down uh drop the traffic the crew would have no access to the internet before the cellular ones fail with this rule however if you select fail through the next rule you can create another rule below this rule that would direct true traffic to another wan for example vsat if you're using speed fusion you can create a rule of priority or enforced to direct traffic to the speed fusion tunnel so that's why i'm going to create now and it's a rule that i'll use later on so i'm going to call it all to speed fusion so any traffic going anywhere i want to enforce it and i want that to go over the vpn to the fusion hub i'm not going to enable this just yet because i'm going to enable it once i uh do the demo of the speedfusion failover so at the moment i'll just show you my network connections on my computer so currently it won't actually allow me to bring that up onto the screen but my network connections i've got an ethernet net cable connected directly to this pep wave and i am not using my wi-fi my wi-fi is turned off i'm just going to go over a few questions that we've had come through there on the q and a's so tom robinson's asked if you set the dns on the lan vlan then the local clients won't be able to resolve names of their local client servers uh why would you do this would it not be better to set an upstream dns on your wan connection for when it passes the name of a resolution up the chain um the reason why i set the dns servers manually is due to um i've seen issues quite often where a v-set might have a a dns server and then cellular mode as well and if clients connect while they're using one and not the other one um it takes those dns servers and then when the wan changes and the the way that the device is connected to the dns servers are not uh incorrect on the client's device then so i find this bit of that they have the static service if you've got local services that need to be accessed then you can configure those to be accessed using your own dns records on the device um david ashton asked do you have to keep the https persistence rule no you don't have to um there's a default rule below here that you can create and you can customize that to have a default rule there that's the last resort so you you can create the rules however you want them to be to be as simple as you want or as advanced as you want um okay so the aps you can the ap controller can only control access points that are from pip wave so although you can use other access points on the lan you'd have to configure them manually or use a a separate ap controller from that vendor our built-in ap controller can only work with our own aps it's just it'd be impossible to support all the vendors that are out there and the forum address is forum.piplink.com sign up there there's a lot of information on the forum so go and join up okay so let's have a brief look at the firewall rules now so the file rules allow you to block particular devices or traffic so generally on a vessel you're mostly going to be looking at the outbound firewalls because most the trackers outbound there's very little traffic and very rare that you'll have inbound traffic to a vessel so it's similar to the outbound policy there so you can create it by protocol or source or destination so if you had a device that you wanted to block them from accidents and internet you could block them by the mac address or the ip address also via the whole um subnet so if you wanted to block a whole network from accessing the internet for for a particular reason you could uh add that rule here so we can go 192.52 let's get 52. 0 24 destination any and then you change it from the action from allow to deny and when you save that rule and then hit apply better than blocking the owner or the guest network from accessing the internet so i'm not going to apply that now because we we don't really want it um inbound rules so that would be if you had a static public ip address so say on your v set you might have that you can create rules there that block uh inbound rules and you might want to block everything on that because you just don't want anything accessing the vessel via that ip address internal network file rules and local service virals that's all to do with transition between things like um devices on the different vlans and devices at the other end of um the speedfusion tunnel so if you have multiple devices connected to your speaking tunnel you can block them there as well and we've also got the content block in here as well so you can use our content block in there to block particular categories um you can also block different categories here so there's a whole lot of categories that were predefined and you can block them as well so stone has asked is my traffic um going from the internet to the yacht uh to to the speaker union cloud the demo i'm using today is actually using an hd4mbx and fusion have an amazon web service um i set up a fusion hub earlier and that's what i'm using i'm not actually using our speed vision cloud however you could use that um okay so that is the um file rule so again the firewall rules the access rules if you have multiple there that match from top to bottom for rules matched it stops hunting okay so the next thing i am going to look at is applying a speed limit to a user group so if we look at the user groups here we can create a user group so let's create a user group by subnet and this one's going to be the staff so the crew network and we save that and then the guest network is going to be the um guest network obviously so change up address to subnet so we've got three user groups we've got manager staff and guest manager is always unlimited on the speed uh and then the guests and staff you can control that so this is going to mean that any device in that subnet gets the staff user group and anyone and the guest vlan will get the guest user group so now if we go to bandwidth control we can enable bandwidth individual bandwidth limit so you can limit the download so let's say let's put that at say five five megabytes down and one megabyte upload and then for the guest let's say 20 megawatts down and five up so please note that the speed limit is per device and not per group so the advantage of this is to stop an individual user hammering your internet connection so for example for this rule if we apply this it would mean that if there was 10 staff devices connected they are all using the intent the same time uh they would be able to get up to a total of 50 megabytes uh per second between them all uh but no one user will be able to get more than five megabytes per second okay so that brings us to the end of the configuration part of it i'm not going to save those rules there so that's going through a lot of configuration next we're going to go to the um we're going to have a look at some of the information you can get out your advice um well first of all i'll just go back up to the uh some of the questions that we've had during the webinar cover those first um so some people are asking about the mpc exam and that i will come back to that and at the end of the webinar as we've got some information on that that we'll share with you then um i think that's all the questions there for now um okay so i'm just going to switch to another device so this is a device on the lan that's on the wan of my mbx it's my i've done stx setup so we're going to go through the usage so if we look at real time we can see in real time the data that's going through so that's going to build a growth up here so this traffic is the traffic that we're doing uh so obviously not all of it is the traffic from us some of us from some other things um so if we go to hourly usage um we can see how much has been used per hour over the last 24 hours you can also break it down to individual hours so if you click on a particular time slot it'll bring it up and it'll tell you which device has used that data in that particular time so it's very similar for daily and you can click on the individual day see what device you use the traffic for that day you can also rearrange these to have it the largest user at the top so you can sort them by download upload or total and again monthly is similar again for all of these hourly and daily usage you can select the individual ones and things like that as well there so you can select the cellular ones i've only got a single one in my sdx but if you have multiple ones you'll be able to select that so i'm going to jump back to the mbx now so let's have a look at some active sessions so this is to see what users are kind of using on the device at any particular time you can see the the different protocols that have been used so if we go active session um and we're looking at the overview you can see the outbound sessions there's no inbound sessions they're all outbound and we can see that most of them are going across wan one because that's priority one on my dashboard and then there's a few going over cellular too which will be like health checks and things like that so if we refresh that now so obviously we can see one thing here that is very obvious that is the zoom session so that is the webinar so if i click on that we can see more information about that and we can see that all of the zoom traffic is all going across wan one you can also search in a lot more detail and you can change the protocol to something else um so there's a whole lot of protocols there so if you want to go in depth and see what is really going on in your network you can i'm just going to switch it back to any now and it gives you a bit more overview of where things going so this can be very useful to figure out traffic that is um going and traffic you might want to block or push it out to a different particular way and using the outbound policies or file rules okay so the next thing i am going to show you is um speed fusion hot failover so if we look at the dashboard now uh wan one which is my home internet is plugged into the ethernet port and then i've got two cellulars as priority two so if we look at the speed fusion status at the moment i'm just going straight out onto the wan i'm not using speed fusion so as you can see here there's very little traffic going over the speed fusion tunnel you'll see that change later on when i enforce the outbound rule that we created earlier to force me to use the um the speed fusion if we look at real time usage now this is going to start building up a chart of the traffic and the traffic is of this zoom webinar that we're doing now so you can see there the upload uh is peaking out around one megabit per second so if we scroll down a bit so this is aggregate across all ones if we scroll down a bit we can see that that's all going across when one and if we get into cellular ones there's next to no traffic going across the cellular wands so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to unplug the ethernet wayne on the mbx and what should happen is that i will be dropped off this webinar and i'll have to rejoin uh well i'm off i'm going to change this outbound policy uh it's under advanced outbound policy i'm going to create a rule here so all to speed fusion uh any traffic going anywhere and i'm i'm not going to enable now but i will go on offline and waiting for the zoom to reconnect and i'm going to force it to uh the fusion hub so i'm just going to say that um you can see it's grayed out so it's not going to be applied just yet okay so um where are we now yeah so we'll just go back to the traffic charts because ultimately you'll see the traffic chart stop moving here as we lose the feed so i'm going to unplug the ethernet wan port and five four three two oh can anyone hear me yet okay can you hear me give me a thumbs up if you can hear me again okay yes you can hear me now okay so we obviously got disconnected for a bit there um i haven't done the rule yet because i'm actually not connected locally i'm connected over in control so i lost connection to the device as well so what i'm going to do is i'm going to enable this rule and i'm going to save that and apply that and i will probably get kicked off again actually because it's going to a different wan so let's see it might get kicked off from here okay we might have got kicked off again let's see okay are we reconnecting now okay so you can still hear me now okay so i'm just waiting for the end control page to reload now okay so now let me just move the zoom display out of the way so now if we go status and real time we should see very similar here of the traffic going across the just wan one because that's the priority one in the speed fusion at the moment but if we go to the speed vision profile which earlier had very little data going through it now you can see it's actually got data going through that speed fusion profile so the zoom webinar is now going across um that way and so obviously what we've done up until just now where i got disconnected a few times they were showing what happens when you're not using speed fusion so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to do the same thing if i'm plugging the ethernet wan and we will see it here i'm just going to open up a second uh window on um the um and put that on the real time throughput so that we can see that as well just switch between it so it builds up the graph so obviously at the moment if we see this the traffic is going across one one and not really across the cellular um and i'm going to switch it to the pip vpn again so let's just open up this page because it shows in a bit more detail here so i'm going to disconnect the ethernet wan and the mdx again so and five four three two one at speedfusion jump over to the cellular so i did lose a few packets there as it failed over but it's reconnected and we haven't gone through the whole regular role of me having to end the webinar and reconnect to it again so that is what speedfusion does to keep things running so i'm also going to now just reconnect the ethernet wan and again so i'm going to plug it in now and in about 20 seconds when one will become active again if we switch over to uh the throughput we can see now that um the aggregated wan you can see here there's been traffic the whole time but it was on one one initially when one fell when i unplugged it and you can see here cellular one and two took over so we went from having a single one on speed fusion to having two bonded so if we go back to the speed fusion here again you can see that when one is actually taken back over the connection now as it's become healthy again you can also manually disable it here by clicking there so that's another way of doing it but i the first time i do it there i physically disabled the connection so for the rest of this webinar i'm going to leave it on the cellular wan on speed fusion so okay so do we have any questions about speed fusion and that failover i did just there okay so enrique is asking is it possible to outbound policy to the vpn link yes on the outbound policy you can select um the vpn link so what i did here is under outbound policy i enforced all traffic to the vpn you can do all sorts of things they're just individual devices mac address um things like that um david's asking um is it is there an easy way to send voip traffic to speed fusion um you could set up a vlan just for your voice devices if you've got voip phones if you know the protocol that's been used you can select it there you can also manually um specify the port that's been used for voip and you can do that and you could force that to there on the vpn on the speed fusion side we've got i've i've done a very basic configuration on the speed fusion um i'm not using any advanced settings um so this one's just set up uh with all on priority one and i did the priority actually was done on the dashboard you could change the priority here and have all them probably one on the main dashboard i haven't got one smoothing or forward area correction or anything like that setup you can actually set up multiple speed fusion tunnels within the same one and then you can use outbound policies directly in different tunnels so for that you could use things like voip in that um that's a bit more advanced we're not going to go into that today but it is possible to do that there and and the pep link partners are well versed in doing those kind of advanced configurations on speed fusion okay so when you does it see what is the best configuration for using speed fusion if the main connection is vsat so generally what we say is don't use speed fusion over vsat so it's just the tcp acceleration doesn't handle the latency very well um however in our newest in this firmware we do have some tcp acceleration magic working so we are going to be testing with that soon on um on a yacht and test that out and see how that works for throughput and things things like that um but on the um so for the configuration for say speed fusion and cellular and vsat what i'd recommend is in the outbound policy you'd have a rule that would be say um you could have it set up as priority and just have the vpn in that rule and then you can move everything else out of that rule um sorry everything else i'm not going to do it just now but you can do that so prior to there and then um what you do is have that so everything's going to go to the vpn when that vpn's not available you can have it fail through the next rule and then the next rule could be could be uh go to priority of uh vsat so that that means that the um speed fusion vpns can be used um by the traffic specified this rule um when the uh there's at least one cellular active in the and the speed fusion is connected if the if all the cylinders fail and the speed fusion disconnects all that traffic will then be able to connect on the vsat so obviously you could do that with one rule for your whole network or you could do different rules for different networks enrique is asking what version is this this is our latest firmware 8.1.0 and it is going to be released from beta uh i believe uh next week possibly uh so be generally available then um enrique what device are you using um because some of our devices don't have um these uh some of the advanced more advanced features so for example on the br1 you don't have the uh speed fusion bonding um but you do have pip vpn which is very similar but only single lan at the same time so let's just have a look at the throughput chart now and now it's built up with more information so as you can see it's nicely bonding across these two sim cards here okay so i'm going to now switch back to the um the slideshow and yep so now we're going to go through some examples of good and bad answers from the maritime pce exam so this is the last thing we're going to look at today and it's all about the long question from the mpc so so for a while now pepperling has had um two main training paths the pce peppermint certified engineer and the pc ss which is the peplin certified sales specialist we've now introduced the uh pip link uh with injuries vertical pcs so these fall below the pipeline certified engineer so you've got to be pep link certified engineer before you can undertake these exams the first one we've done is the maritime certified engineer we did a whole uh webinar series about this a few months ago so if you want to view that go to our forum and you'll be able to have a look there so you're not limited on the amount of certifications you can take a lot of candidates have taken more than one so this is an example of a failed question this isn't a real answer from someone um this is just we've taken info from kind of a few and reworded it and put it here just kind of show an example of what would cause you to fail the exam the exam so this candidate has just pretty much said these are the cons of this install and these are the pros i'm not going to show the actual question here because there's um five questions that will be that uh we select from that are randomly assigned to each uh exam that's taken um so this one was for a balanced 380 in the center network and two hd4s connected to it so simply put this this camera just did not go into any detail they just put a few bullet points and that was it and that's not what we're looking for so the next failed example we're going to look at is again they kind of put some valid information there but it's not enough information i'm not really going into any details about it so they're they're providing an appropriate solution but they're not justifying it or explaining what kind of technologies they're going to use and things like that okay so this is a good example this candidate has clearly explained the pros and cons of the existing installation and recommended two appropriate upgrade options along with explain how they would implement the solutions using our technologies such as speedfusion so just um so you know we've extended the um mpc exam campaign until the end of september so it's free until the end of september so you can head along to our training portal and get certified today so of these examples i've showed you here especially this one the good one don't just copy and paste that into the answer the npc that'll be an instant fail yeah but you can only the idea we really want you to explain the idea of of your solution and why you believe that that's it you can provide more than one solution we know that sometimes you give multiple quotes to clients and things like that so yeah the the mpc exam is more aimed at the pip link partners but the um on board operators people are using equipment every day you can feel free to do the exam as well it's good to have on your cv okay so that brings us to the end of the content today so um if you've got any questions um please use the q a function to ask questions um if there's anything that i've skipped over or you didn't quite understand let me know we can go back to the configuration on the mbx and have a look at that if you want um asking the pip vpn limit i'm assuming you're asking about the speed fusion throughput limit or the amount of pairs that you can connect to it so on the mbx so it varies depending on the device uh on the mdx it's two speed fusion uh pairs you can have connected so it could be two separate fusion hubs um and you can increase that five or twenty i believe it is with a license that you can apply to it so you can purchase an additional license to allow more the throughput of speed fusion if you're using fusion hub it is unlimited throughput um you're limited by what connect speed you've got available at that fusion hub and available on the um speed fusion on your wants as such okay so that came through the chat i'm now going to look at the question and answers um okay so what sort of the max capacity is possible uh we're searching for a warranted 140 megabits per second over lte okay so um lte cellular is never guaranteed um unless you own the network um you're going to struggle to guarantee a throughput in the higher numbers but it's definitely possible to have much higher throughputs i'm just going to bring up uh one now with some speed test results um so this was a speed test i did an on team last year i've shown these in in previous webinars so let me just bring that out of full screen okay so can you see that screenshot now that i've shared give me a thumbs up if you can see a screenshot of the okay very good hey george how you doing um okay so this was a test i did in ontab um this was just with uh two sefa sim cards and two rsm cards on a category 12 hd4 mbx so this is using this vpn test uh within the uh router and as you can see there i'm getting a total of 304 megabits per second download it did get up to 360 megabits per second but i didn't quite uh get the screenshot quick enough on that but as you can see it is nicely balancing across all the wands there the latency has gone a bit high that's because the link is getting saturated uh but we don't have any packet loss so that's 304 that's 314 megabit throughput uh 316 and then on the on the um upload there you can see we got 210 and then this one up to 150. again here you can see it is nicely balancing across the different ways there is quite a packet loss on one way in there but that's just naturally what speed vision will do is compensate for that so pretty much the speeds that you're going to get are going to be determined by the network provider and what is actually available at that particular location and the load on the network so yeah so that's i hope that answers your question if you want to test that i mean the best way to do it is to test and see what you can get but um if you if you're going to test for say you you guaran trying to guarantee that kind of speed and say for example is for a concert or a live event or something like that you can't go and test a few days before when there's no one around and get wicked results that day and then expect to come back on the day of the event and get the same results once you get that venue flooded with hundreds of people the local networks just get flooded and you won't necessarily get the same throughput as what you might expect we see that happen regularly with events like the monaco grand prix and the live concerts and things like that um enrique's asking about the outbound policy to vpn link um i hope i answered that a little bit earlier there with the outbound policy you can do that matthew is asking is it possible to bond the four wan connections and two cellular wands for higher connection speeds yes it is so i can do that right now so let's come back here uh so actually just now the wan is actually just taken back over because um the configuration i had here if we go to the speed fusion page again when i disabled the wan that we were using i'd only done it as temporarily so when you disable it here it only disables it temporarily and after 15 minutes it re-enables it so that's what happened there uh of this that's where you'll see the traffic would have has jumped back over the wan and off the cellular if we go back to the dashboard now i am going to drag the two cellular wands i've got into priority one so this will now bond all those three available connections into a single uh vpn so they'll be bonded together so you see we've now got three active if we now go status uh real time i'll say it's the real-time one there so there's speed fusion so you can see that all three are now active in this profile here and all three are both receiving and transmitting data so that's bonding a fiber optic connection and two cellulars together so let's just go back here to the actual device throughput so we can actually see data on wan one and on salinas so it's going across all three links at the same time i hope that answers your question matthew uh simon bush if we have a low load balance on the cell would we have a lossless transition rather than dropped packet um i'm not exactly sure what you mean there by the low load balance do you mean low low balance set on the pep wave or low load on the actual cell um pretty much what what's happening with the cellular is it's constantly checking the connection to make sure it is active and if it doesn't get responses it'll treat us down and then use the next available connection speed fusion if you're using it is is checking that data is actually arriving at server at the other end so it's much more reliable again because it's really checking that data is arriving so it really depends on your configuration how you have it set up um so someone anonymous is asking the untagged vlan id to have a vlan id of none um yep so that's kind of standard on the vlan tags is that the base vlan will just be left uh empty so if we click on that there you can see that there is no option here to add a vlan tag so that is just the default way vlans work because it is not a vlan it's just the base uh lan so it doesn't have a vlan tag associated with it um roger's asking can you stop some devices when on cellular but okay for word yes so that can be done in the outbound policy um and um i believe we can also do some stuff in the file rules there as well um so what you can do is in the outbound policy you can create a rule that uh say enforces all traffic um [Music] to say uh wan one and that'll mean that all traffic has been forced to one one and it won't be able to use any of the other wands alternatively you could have it weighted balance on just the cellulars and so let's get rid of one one two and three here and then also the usb ones obviously they're not active now but we can just disable them um so that means that there's going to load balance on the four cellulars and then what you do is you leave this here is drop the traffic and what that means if those four sellers fail it's going to drop the traffic and they can have internet access so that's what you can do there charles dooley is asking can one set the priorities of services via speed fusion yes you can do that in the speed view and settings so obviously i was doing it mainly on the dashboard here but you can also do it under advanced and um speed fusion css to the fusion up so you can change them the priorities there as well okay so jeremy's asking um how many ssids can you have um that depends on the device so most of our cellular routers can handle i believe three ssids so things like the transit duo and the bl ones and that kind of stuff but within the ap controller you can you can actually enter more and that's because um the access points um all our access points can handle up to 16 ssids simultaneously so just a note the br1 doesn't have an ap controller but the transit joy does so what you can do is you can enter in here so for example on this mbx i believe we have yeah three aps three ssids that'd be broadcast from the mbx itself um and we've got three at the moment you can also turn off the access point uh the ap from the mbx so if you're using uh ap spread out throughout the vessel you can just use them um but under the s under the ap controller you can have up to you can have many connect um specified here but only 16 will be able to be acted upon um and they'll be able to be pushed out to the uh access points spread out around the vessel which we'll be able to have uh yeah up to 16 there so quite a few should be able to support you for all of your [Music] applications um okay scott's asking what is the data cost for speed fusion pinging do you understand how to fix cellular data usage yeah so that's that's one thing you want to set up and test for yourself and see what is really using it i can have a look here i'm not sure uh obviously because i've been using this this pet vpn for data it's going to be more than just the vpn sitting there um but the overall um the there is an additional overhead from using uh speed fusion it's about 18 on average but you can also look um here and see what the pip vpn is using for just to keep alive so if you set up a pip vpn and enforce all traffic to not use it you could then monitor it and see how much data goes over in a period of an hour a day or a month so it's saying you want to sit up there i am actually going to be doing that later on this week for a partner just i've got a lab set up to to demo that just to see what really is going on there um tg's asking do the aps like the ap1ax have its own controller or do you need to have a max modem or balance router to act as controller okay so laps can be configured in three ways there's three different ways you can control them uh first way is you can log into the access point and configure it manually so you can configure it with an ssid everything completely independent of any other device set it up as as it is like that the second way is is as we did today with the ap controller which can be done from a max router the x series or the balance series router the third way you can manage them is from in control so you can add the serial number and turn control and manage it from the cloud so completely depends on your situation on how you want to set it up and control it um okay so danny's asking what if i use and port uh the cellular connection and when i'm out of range i would use one one and one two connect to v set with more or less equal latency will speed fusion still struggle with the latency even when they're kind of similar yes they will um the the reason is is to do with the tcp acceleration there as i said earlier we do have some tcp magic going on with the new firmware and i'm going to be testing that in the coming weeks with some over some vsat on some vessels but pretty much i'll give you an example i had a media fast 750 set up with two two-way connections so each two-way connection had about 26 megabytes download available to it and six megabytes upload so they were both going into like when one and when two on the uh media fast if i did a speed test across one connection i would get 26 megabytes download and six megawatts up by like the full speed available to it um if i did um if i ran speed fusion across one connection uh one of the vpn connections i would get about one to two megabytes through put on that pip on that speed fusion um if i then ran that speed fusion across two uh two of the the v-set connections uh or two of the two-way connections i was getting about the same as i was on uh on one vsat so that was like one one megabit throughput so um yeah so i was getting about one megabit through but bonded across two connections it's just the tcp limitation uh acceleration limitations there with the massive latency um so yeah so it's not advised to try and bond satellite um obviously once we i've tested the tcp magic that we've got going on i will let you know how that goes uh calvin's asking is there a way to have more user groups in the manager staff and guest no there isn't um we've only got three user groups it has been requested quite a bit um if for features like that go to the forum if you ask on the forum the more the more attention it gets on the forum the more likely the engineers are to look at it and um and implement it in future firmwares um okay so i'm just having a look at some other things here so michael lloyd's asked uh just created a fusion hub instance in aws what's the default credentials i tried admin admin as for the manual um if you have a look at the uh particular notes regarding the new fusion hub that's in the amazon website's marketplace the new password is actually the amazon instance id um so it's a bit more secure than us just having uh admin admin as the username password on a publicly facing device okay so do we have any further questions um i think i've answered most them there um so i'm just trying to see if there are any more um abby is asking is it possible to configure drop-in mode without a static ip address um i believe it is because you just use dhcp let me actually just check on that actually i don't think it's because it's designed to be used between a router and your lan so we're assuming that you've got a static ip address on your wan because you're connected to uh that so i'm just having a look here uh let's go through the wand connections selfie go routine mode yeah now you might want to check on that i can't check on it just now but i will check on it for you there abby so andrew is asking i'm currently using a bitstorm extreme mj as wan problem is that the wan is always up how can i get the router to change to cellular if the wan is not available so i'm assuming what you're saying is that your route the link between your pep way device and the uh the router provided by your network that link is always up but the internet is down so what you want to do is uh you want to look at your health check settings here so you want to um create a health check rule that there's either ping dns lookup or http so what that means is even though that the pep wave has seen an ethernet link to your router it's also going to ping something or do a dns lookup on the internet and actually confirm that your router actually has internet if that fails it'll then treat that wanderers down and your traffic will be failed over the next uh available van so in your case the cellular link um for wi-fi when antennas um it really depends on your situation um if you're looking to connect to port wi-fi and you've got a home port and you're a long way away from the port wi-fi you might want to look at directional antennas um if you're a vessel that's traveling a lot and connected to different wi-fi's um you're better off going with some omni-directional antennas again have a look at our previous webinars there's a lot of info there about antenna selection and things like that um okay suppose you're asking for recording this session we will put a post up on the forum in the next few days and that'll have some links to the whole um session and also to uh some of the frequently asked questions that have been asked and things like that there uh okay where's the webinar gone me for a second there um yeah i've lost the screen i was after i seem to have lost the slideshow but that doesn't matter we're at the end of the webinar anyway um okay i'm just having one last look over the questions now okay in the chat there was a question uh let me see where it is nope i've missed it sorry there was a question but i can't see it anymore okay so i think that brings us to the end of today's session so thank you very much for joining us um and if you do have any questions head over to our forum there's lots of information on the forum so yeah hope everyone has a good day and cheers"}

name is travis durk and i'm a product manager here at peplink and the topic we're going to talk about today is peppling for public safety we're going to highlight some features that you may or may not be familiar with but nonetheless features that we find public safety users really really like and find useful so of course peplink's mission is unbreakable connectivity anytime and anywhere so i can't think of a user base where that's more relevant than what public safety they get called to all kinds of unique places and they never know what time they're going to need to be there but they need reliable connectivity and they need it to work exactly the same every time they go out and so again our mission seems very well aligned with the needs of the public safety users so we're going to show you how users can leverage our unbreakable connectivity and some of the things they can do with that so like i said we're going to show you five different features that we've found public safety users really find useful out in the field and help them do do what they need to do to achieve unbreakable connectivity so i'm going to just walk you through those real quick here and then we'll cover a couple other topics and then we'll go into more of a live demo of each of these features towards the end so that you can see where they are and get a little better understanding of how each one works and how you might be able to use it so first up is gps and land quality reports in our in control 2 central management system there's super rich data that's recorded and stored for historical signal strength and when quality and that's also matched up with some the gps capabilities in the product so you can get really intuitive maps about where your signal strength issues might be and where so you can diagnose problems that you get reported from the field another similar feature but quite different in another way is the gps broadcast and export public safety users have had gps mapping applications in their cars for years often but not in an internet connected manner and so when when they go to upgrade their their connectivity in the cars or the the communications equipment in the cars adding a router that already has gps capability is great but often public safety users want to integrate that new gps feed into an existing application that runs on a pc or mobile data terminal in the vehicle and so we'll show you where those features are and how you can use those another one when you're rolling out lots of lots of devices for lots of users zero touch configuration is a really big time saver and so we'll show you how our in control to management system can help you scale up your deployments really fast so that you can make sure everybody's got the same configuration and you're able to quickly update configurations if there's needs to for security or any other reasons similarly ic2 has a zero touch configuration interface for our speed fusion configurator and so that's what lets you do the packet level unbreakable sd-wan technology that peplink offers in a really simple and again zero touch configuration manner and last but not least is the in control 2 alerting system now this isn't as exciting as some of the other features but it's super useful and super relevant especially for public safety so we'll show you where those where those alerts are and all the different options that you can alert on inside there so before we go into the live demo i'm going to show you our public safety router portfolio so that you can understand some models and products that are going to fit really nicely into different public safety scenarios so you can see there's a lot of options to pick from and that's really what we're hoping for here is that we're going to have a model that's going to fit the needs of almost any scenario your public safety users can throw at you so at the top we've got single cellular routers with just one lte connection in them in the middle we've got the two cellular mode modems models with two cellular radios inside of each of them and then at the bottom we've got three and four radio models for even higher end applications where lots of connectivity and lots of bandwidth is required so starting at the top we've got our 399 transit mini this is an awesome upgrade from a hotspot device so if your public safety users are used to using maybe a usb modem or some sort of consumer wi-fi hotspot device this 399 transit mini is an excellent upgrade it's got ignition sense and nice vehicle-friendly power input so it's gonna attach to the car and get mounted permanently and so it's always to be ready to go and always in a ready state when your your users are are ready to go and go on their mission we've also on the second tier that dual modem product the first one there that transit duo that's a that's an exceptional price point in the market for a two radio product that's 9.99 and it's got two category 12 radios in there so you can connect one to firstnet and the other one to verizon and you can get all the benefits of both of those networks in one affordable box oftentimes that router is cheaper than a lot of competitors single radio models even so it's a tremendous value with two two connections in that one box on the dual radio side you can also see there's a couple outdoor models those are excellent for remote outpost locations that don't have very high quality wire line connectivity or maybe the building material is just really challenging for getting signal but those can also be used for mobile applications like mobile command or higher value assets that need a little better connectivity than maybe a traditional smaller vehicle and then again the last tier there is our multi-modem the three and four modem configurations these are really designed for mobile command centers and other applications that require really high bandwidth or really stable connectivity so you can see we've got a full stack of different models to fit into different needs and different price points for public safety users so we feel really strongly that we've got a great lineup to again let you fit into whatever project your users might have so how do you achieve unbreakable connectivity we talked about that at the beginning on unbreakable connectivity anytime anywhere what does that mean our unbreakable connectivity is is what we describe as the the user's experience when when they start using these multiple connections there's other companies that make dual lte routers right you a lot of you have seen those products but there's a big difference between a dual radio product and a dual radio product with speed fusion with the traditional dual radio product you can connect users to multiple networks but what happens is all of their traffic gets sent to one radio or the other radio and that traffic is going to live and die on that radio so if you have a user that starts up a vpn session from their laptop the router is going to send that either out radio 1 or radio 2 and again if that whichever radio the router picks if you move into an area where that carrier's coverage isn't good that vpn is going to time out it's going to have interruptions and eventually that vpn session is going to break now the router is going to automatically let it reestablish to the other healthy healthy radio but again that user experience is not unbreakable connectivity the user got interrupted and who knows what they might have been doing right connectivity interruption for a public safety user can be literally a life and death situation so doing that automatic failover is helpful but it really doesn't solve the user's problem it really doesn't deliver on what their expectations of a dual radio product should be doing for them and so that's where peplink's patented speed fusion technology comes into play what speed fusion lets us do is it lets us shift traffic at the packet level so if a user's vpn is mostly using verizon but suddenly there's a coverage issue there we can shift that vpn session again at the packet level over to the other firstnet connection so that that user doesn't experience a drop in their connection they don't have to re-establish their vpn they don't even know that they switched from verizon to to firstnet we can completely hide that from them so that their experience is really truly that unbreakable one so this lets you combine the coverage of multiple networks and when you've got two networks in play at the same time it lets you combine the bandwidth of those two networks even for a single session like a user vpn so speed fusion technology has a few different modes that lets us use this packet level technology to achieve different outcomes and protect traffic in different ways so at the bottom we've got hot failover again that's that seamless handoff from one carrier to another you're not necessarily actively using both at one time but you can fail over in less than one second from one carrier to another wan smoothing is another speed fusion strategy that helps you protect real-time traffic so you can protect live video live audio voice over ip radio over ip there's multiple modes and technologies within lan smoothing that lets you enhance that real-time traffic on single and multi-lan links and last is bandwidth bonding people want more throughput in the field so they can get high quality video uploaded they can get all kinds of files and data sent from the field out elsewhere for for other parties to to digest and process when there's a situation and so speed fusions bandwidth bonding lets you share those connections even again for a single application so your users vpn could for example utilize both connections at the same time instead of just failing over from one to the other so there's lots of flexibility and you can create application level policies that let you apply these different modes to different types of traffic so that you're doing one smoothing on video but for like email or file uploads maybe you're doing bandwidth bonding so you've got the flexibility to carve out those policies and appropriately protect each type of traffic that your users are doing so a couple examples of how you could use this would be live streaming video from a from a vehicle so again speed fusion can bond multiple cellular links so that even a single video transfer can use the bandwidth of of multiple links and we've got our wind smoothing technology that lets you smooth out that video so that you can reduce your average latency you can reduce packet loss you can smooth out the the jitter across multiple connections so that you can always dynamically use the fastest most responsive link for that video stream so often times right now dvrs and v in vehicles are kind of a kind of a captive box right there's not a lot of live activity or a live viewing being done with those it's recording whatever's happening in the field and then when those vehicles drive into their depot or headquarters then there's either a hard drive swap or some sort of wi-fi upload that happens but again oftentimes those those dvrs in the vehicles aren't really a real-time live tool but again with speed fusion you can upgrade that so you can add that speed fusion connectivity so you could actually see live so you could let a dispatcher watch real time not waiting for 5g you can do that on 4g networks today using speedfusion another great example of what you can do with speedfusion is extend to two-way radios over ip so you can get users on your radio system anywhere they they go and you can backhaul them using again lte networks instead of traditional rf networks that two-way radios are typically limited to so there's a lot of vendors out there that have kind of ip to ip to two-way radio interfaces and so you can plug those into a speedfusion-enabled router so that you can go into all kinds of unique places that your lan mobile radio networks might not reach so i know a couple years ago we had some users out in the east coast in the blue ridge mountains that they had just very mountainous terrain right and so the two-way radio networks the lmr networks just had a hard time covering all the nooks and crannies that the mountains and valleys would create and so what they did is they utilized an lte carrier and a satellite carrier to do a hot failover configuration and then they they plugged that into a radio to ip device from their lmr vendor so that they could have smooth seamless handoff between the terrestrial lte network and then fall back to that line of sight satellite network so they're they're really pleased with the ability to blend those two different technologies in a seamless way that really allowed them to operate much more efficiently and much more reliably out in the field than they could with traditional two-way lmr or even augmenting that with lte so again it's that speed fusion packet level sd-wan technology that lets you blend these different networks together in a seamless and productive way so i won't waste any more time talking about scenarios and slides we're just going to dive into the into the routers and show you what each of these features look like so again first up we're going to do the in control 2 gps and land quality reports i'm just going to switch my screen share here and go over to our in control gui so just bear with me for one second [Music] okay so we are logged into our in control group here and so we've got a lot of devices here um but first up we're just going to show you like i said the gps and wan quality reports so i've got a cad 18 hd2 mbx that we're going to look at here to get to these reports i'll take a step back here i'm at the group level where we can see all our different devices so for example in this device this is that cad 18 mbx here so we're going to click on that so we're at the device level now and so when we're at the device level if you go into reports you can see when quality reports and so then you're given a map and a blank graph to start out with but i had a user let's just say we had a user report an issue on june 30th and so we're going to go look at this verizon connection that they had and they said i think it was around 1710 so around 5 10 p.m they had they had an issue so we're just going to scroll back to that point in time okay and so we can see on the top here we've got a signal graph with lots of different metrics here we've got the all the different signal metrics you would want rsrp signal to noise ratio rsrq and then we've also got the latency graphed out there in blue so you can see a lot of data at once but again that user reported some issues right around 5 10 pm or 1710 now below you can see that same time period overlaid with the gps information so you can see for the most part we had good connectivity but you can see already just with the color coding we've got some kind of dead zones and maybe some some low signal areas here so if we look at the connectivity right right before 1710 you can see things look pretty good we've got good signal strength you can see the rsrq is kind of starting to degrade a little bit latency looks pretty good still then we start to get some latency spikes so you can see 300 milliseconds now we've got some gaps in the latency so the latency reports aren't coming back indicating some packet loss maybe but then you can see the latency starts to really spike up so we've got 700 milliseconds but you can see so you can see you start to see the problems with the latency first then you start to see the signal strength kind of start to reflect similar issues so you can see the rsrq is going down the rsrp is going down and then eventually we get this wind down event so this is our health checking mechanism saying okay i've lost packets whatever thresholds you define for your your outage window however long you've set that to that that event whenever that triggers is going to get displayed here on the graph too so you can very easily identify these issues so again you can see we had kind of some latency startup and then eventually our health checks failed and we considered it down but it wasn't a very long outage it was just a real quick real quick event and we came back up just a minute or two later now this is a multi-radio product so the user didn't probably didn't actually experience an issue if they were using our speed fusion but again this is a great tool to just tie back those problem reports and see if this is a coverage issue or see if there's something else maybe going on that might be impacting it so i highly recommend you you take a look at the when quality reports if you've got users reporting issues it's a really great tool to really dig into what those problems are [Music] so next up i'm going to show you just the more basic gps functionality of our system so again when you're at the device level you get all this data at the top but then down towards the bottom you get the map view so today this device hasn't really moved a whole lot it's set in this parking lot but again if we go back in time we can pull up another day and in this particular day this user went went pretty far so they they went from more of an urban area to a more rural area so we can blow this up we can view this in full screen we can also play it back real time so if we want to kind of see at a particular point in time where a user was you can just quickly scrub around to where that what that time stamp is you can also play it real time or or you can play it at whatever speed you want to track so you can also show the events that happened during that drive so it takes just a second to populate here but you can see we've got a new key it shows up over here so you get all kinds of different events that get tagged on the map at wherever they happened so you can see device online offline wands up or down and then speed fusion tunnels being up or down and then we've got this blue one that just kind of shows you anything else that might have happened so you can hover over those events and you can see okay yep this was a client connecting to wi-fi we got a red flag over here the device went offline there okay and then we've got some disconnects on the cellular connection so again you can take a look back and really see where those issues happened without the user even having to report it the other cool thing you can do is you can monitor speeds here so if we change the color track by default it's just a blue line but if we want to take a look at the speed we can set whatever speed limit we want i'm just going to say it's 70 miles an hour so you can see there's another key that shows up on the right here and it changes the color coding based on the speed limit that you set and so in this case again i've set it to 70 miles an hour so anything that goes over 70 miles an hour is going to be coated red on them on the map and so again we can play that out so here you can see the user got onto an interstate highway and obviously went a little bit faster than 70 miles an hour i'm making that threshold up as a cap on speed but i think you understand you can very quickly identify users that are going faster than they should be or just get a sense of how fast those users are going so it's just one more nice feature to use with our gps functionality you can also download all of this information into a format that you can use in programs like google earth or maybe some other mapping applications you want to ingest and process this information some other way so you've just got that handy little button there and again you can just see that over time so if you want to just zoom in you can click on something you can see the user's timestamp speed lat long altitude all that all that good information so tons of tons of useful capabilities there all included within control 2. [Music] next up we're going to talk about the gps broadcast and export capability so this is something that's at the router level it's not necessarily part of in control 2. so we're going to log into this particular router and you can see on on the balance models that have gps capability it's under the network tab on the max models it's under the advanced tab so that the tree on the left is going to look the same depending on the product but to get there again it's either the network or the advanced tab and then you'll see gps forwarding over here on the bottom left so if you check this box it gives you a lot more options so you can punch in different devices ip addresses or host names that you want to be able to send this gps feed over to so that they can listen in and and use for their own purposes so again cad applications that run in the vehicles any sort of mapping routing applications that that come that agencies are running in their mobile data terminals these are all examples of systems that you might use this functionality with so it could be that you're sending that stream to a device that's local in the vehicle or you could be relaying this information to an external cad systems kind of central view so that your dispatch center could get more of a zoomed out view of all their different vehicles out in the field so those are two examples of systems that you might use this feature with but again in any case you can just type in whatever cad system that might whatever url that may be or whatever ip address that may be if it's an external system we're just going to make up a port number and then you can tell it how often you want to send the gps stream over to it now you can also do broadcast addresses multicast addresses so if you've got an address for example you can just if you've got a software system that listens to listens for this via broadcast you can do that on the local network that way you've got lots of formatting options so you can you can use nmea or taip and with each one comes some respective options so i am not the most the the most authoritative on all the nuances of these different gps sentence types but public safety users will definitely be familiar with these and there's lots of different little nuances that we've added over the years specifically to the request of public safety agencies that needed those those features and functionality so definitely don't hesitate if you don't see something in here that you need for your specific application let us know it's often quite quite easy to to keep uh adding different little capabilities to that it looks like i wasn't showing my screen when i started that so i'll show you guys that here again here at the top we've got the different servers that you're sending this information to it could be unicast if you call out a specific ip or host name or you could do a broadcast ip and again you've got your different report formats to pick from if we choose taip you'll see that again the sentence types change but again most people are going to find this very familiar they're going to know which which report format and sentence type their system is looking for or or configured to use so again very flexible very easy to integrate with those types of applications [Music] so the next one we're going to talk about is zero touch configuration so if we go back to the public safety webinar group here there's several different items that you can provision in bulk across any different products of ours again from the single pane of glass just a few clicks so let's start out with wi-fi so let's say we've deployed several different products that support wi-fi so it might be our transit mini in a lot of your your cruisers and then it might be something like an hd2 or hd4 in one of your mobile command vehicles but regardless you want the same wi-fi networks on all of those different devices and so that's really easy with pep link and in control 2. you can just come under this wi-fi ap group wide ssid settings you can see right now it shows wi-fi config is all device managed so that's kind of one at a time each router has kind of programmed its own wi-fi settings in it but we can override that and standardize all the wi-fi configs so first thing we do is we turn on wi-fi management so this just says the routers can ignore their local wi-fi configs and listen to in control for whatever ssids are supposed to be provisioned we can click add a new ssid we name it and we just we can choose which devices or how we provision this now we've got a lot of flexibility here so you can just simply say i want the same network on every one of my devices that might be the appropriate choice for your scenario or you can say i want it on some devices and then you can use tags to control which devices are going to actually take that ssid so different devices might have a different mission or a different role and so then you can differentiate which devices get which ssids but again make sure that all of them have that same policy if they're taking that so that you don't have any room for error when you're configuring your routers now you've got all the all the normal options you would have for encryption and those kinds of things if you've got external radius you can use those for more advanced security you've got the fast roaming capabilities you've got client isolation if it's more of a guest wi-fi or a bring your own device type of scenario staging areas mobile command centers might be good examples where you've got other agencies coming in to assist with a with an incident but they don't necessarily need or you're not shouldn't be giving them your your enterprise credentials but again you can make a secure private network for them to get on and participate as well with the unbreakable connectivity so obviously there's tons of different options you can set for each each ssid you've also got captive portal options so again you've got tons of control to make the ssid configurations match whatever you want on all of your devices even if it's different models so we're going to save this one maybe i hope you don't need enterprise for this particular demo so i just punched in the security key [Music] and we're just going to push it to all the devices so you can see i missed a few settings but the system showed me what they were and we got that figured out pretty quick so if we go back to the dashboard we'll let this populate and you can see now the wi-fi config is listed as group level and the wi-fi ap is enabled if it's got this this icon here the other thing you can see is last config applied and so this is telling me that in control actually applied a configuration in the timestamp of that so you can see the devices that support wi-fi took this config all a few seconds ago so this is very real time right this is a this is a real time management system this isn't gonna take minutes or hours to to roll out this is pretty much instantaneous now you can see this particular unit doesn't have its wi-fi ap enabled it took the config but the wi-fi is not on there there's a switch in the router that you can turn the wi-fi on and off so you can do that two ways if we open this br1 up you can see right here there's just this little off slider if i clicked on that that would turn the the wi-fi back on so you can quickly enable or disable the wi-fi at an individual level but you can also do that at the group level in bulk so if you click edit we can check as many units as we want and then under actions we can save wi-fi ap state let's turn that wi-fi on two of the three already have it on but we know the other one didn't and so boom there we go wi-fi ap is enabled on that router and again you can see this this device already had it on it didn't take a config change from this particular event and same with this one it was already on so it didn't take a config but this unit you can see very quickly it did take that so you get confirmation of these things actually being applied so you know confidently that whatever change you made is actually making it out to the field and when it did now the other cool thing is this is a this system is going to hold those instructions for any units that aren't online so if you've got a router that's offline when you push a config change out it will take those instructions whenever it comes online next so you don't have to keep pushing and keep distributing those configurations as units come online it's going to automatically take those instructions [Music] so other ways that zero touch configuration plays out in in control 2 is under the network settings here at the group level so stuff like firewall rules are another thing that you can manage centrally and again you can manage this centrally across all of our different products so it doesn't matter if you've got different models in play they all have the firewall capability so you can provision all our different models with one policy here or you can create again multiple policies and push the push those out by tags to the appropriate units i've already enabled this feature but similar to the wi-fi that we showed you you just check that box to enable managing the firewall and then you can create a rule set or you can import a rule set if you've got a router already config the way you want it you can just download that config from the router import it here and it's going to automatically build that same configuration in the cloud interface here i've set up a really simple policy here to show you i'm calling this region blocking and this is using a unique feature of in control 2 to add more security to your users so on the outbound policy what i've done is under the default rule i've said let's deny everything so basically if that's the only rule the users on the network cannot talk cannot establish any internet connectivity above that rule i've created one simple rule to allow traffic destined for any region in north america so this is using the internet i p address assignments to identify whatever website you might be going to or whatever system you might be accessing is that ip actually living in the us or not so we can we can detect that and again with these simple firewall policies we can allow you to talk to things in north america but with that default rule if it's not in north america it's going to get blocked so if your users get sent some sort of weird phishing scam that goes to some server overseas this rule is going to protect your users from actually clicking on that and getting to that that site now you can add any other firewall policies you normally would here but again the whole concept is that it's going to automatically push this out to all the devices we've selected so in this case i've said all balance and max routers but we could just use that firewall tag instead if we wanted to to just selectively choose which devices we we pushed this policy out too so you might have different policies for users that are out in the field versus you know dispatch facilities or or offices like that there might be reasons to have different policies for your devices in your deployment so you've got tons of flexibility to do that so you can push out vlans group networks are just kind of helpers for firewall policies if you've got a bunch of ips that you want to just lump under one name for rules that's great outbound policy and again captive portal so you've got tons of different tools at your disposal to centrally manage and do zero touch provisioning of all these different capabilities of course you can do firmware and lots of other standard things like that as well in the same bulk manner using tags or group wide the last one is our our bulk configurator so instead of managing all these features through in control you can take a a configuration file from a router that is configured the way you want and you can template that out to any number of devices so again you can upload a configuration file and then you can choose with tags which devices you want to to take that configuration this particular tool is limited to the the same model so you have to have one config file for each model but this is a great way to get your devices off the ground you can do the initial settings with the bulk configuration so you can get apns and all kinds of settings like that right and then you can turn on some of the other more specific tools like the wi-fi or the firewall management to build on whatever settings you pushed out in this bulk [Music] configurator [Music] so next up we'll show you how to use the speed fusion configurator so that's just right here next to the wi-fi ap tab so we'll go to the live status we don't have anything set up yet so we get this little message but if we go to the configuration side we can dive in and build a speed fusion network and you'll see how fast and easy it is so again speed fusion is what enables that packet level sd-wan technology so that users can have that sub-second persistent failover between two networks or get that bonded experience so when you enable that that turns on the map view so you can kind of see where your nodes were last and then we can add a profile so you can choose your topology i promise you don't have to be that networking savvy to build one of these networks so we're going to do a star topology it's going to automatically populate the ips of the devices for the hub device we're going to use our fusion hub fusionhub is the virtual speedfusion appliance that lives in the cloud so you can host that in a public cloud environment or public safety agencies can run it in their own private hypervisors if they've got servers on site or private network configurations you can run fusionhub inside of that so it can be compatible with private network services from the carriers as well again we let you run fusionhub anywhere you want pretty much any public cloud is supported and we support hyper-v esxi lot lots of different local hypervisor options as well but again we're making this fusion hub cloud appliance the center of our network and then i'm just going to choose the routers that i want to actually connect to that speedfusion fusion hub so i've got three routers here that i'm going to connect to this we're going to make the encryption 256 aes so it's nice and secure we're going to turn on nap mode because all of our devices have the same lan side network and so in a traditional vpn that would cause conflicts but if we turn on that mode everybody gets online and gets that bonded experience without conflicting with each other you've got lots of settings but by default you really don't need to do much here you don't really need to configure all of that you can just leave it as default to start and we'll click finish so the thing i always forget to do is click save changes at the bottom we click finish now we have to click save so if we go back to the dashboard view again you're going to see several devices took a configuration again so again we're just validating that these things are are there they're listening and they're actually responding to the the configurations that we're making here if we log into this router that we just told to build that tunnel we can actually go look and see that should that config should be there the system told it what told us it was and so it should be trying to establish that connection to the fusion hub now we'll open that fusion hub up too and we can just look from the other side you can already see actually here we're getting tunnels coming up so you can see that cat 18 mbx is connected you can see the br1 and this other device isn't quite connected yet wrong device too many tabs okay so now you can see we've got tunnels set up this last one's coming online again we just did this live over a couple of minutes we just built a really complex vpn with no sweat at all and again we didn't have to touch any of those routers we just built the profile and it pushed it all out again zero touch configuration super powerful when you're trying to manage a fleet of devices i said we're going to talk about five features today but there's actually one more surprise we'll throw at you this is a new one that's coming out in our next firmware version 8.1.0 i touched on this in a recent webinar but definitely worth showing you folks again here we've added the capability in eight one zero to make all of our routers serve as a time server or an ntp server so it's really simple in the router you just check one box and click save but again it's under the network tab on the balance routers and it's under the advanced tab on the max routers and so this just makes the router respond to ntp requests so if you've got a dvr or a pc or any sort of connected device on the network with this router you can point them to the default ip of this router as their time server public safety users often call these types of ntp servers a net clock so effectively what we've done in 810 is we've added that net clock capability to our product with no extra cost so you can avoid buying a dedicated appliance for this type of functionality or pointing it to something out on the internet you can use the local clock of the router to be that time clock or net clock for all your other devices so this is the first layer of that feature the second layer is what is the router's time source right we need to make sure the router actually has its head on straight with what time it is so if we go under system and click on time and this is located the same in both routers both max and balance routers you can set your time zone you can also set the time zone from in control in a in a zero touch manner but separately from that you can set where the router is getting its time source from so in this case we're telling it to use a time server and then below you can see it's just using the standard public pep link time server but we can use gps as the time source if the router has gps and then we can use gps and fall back to a public time server as well so if you've got a router that's on a private network that doesn't have internet access you can use the native gps in the cellular module to get that time sync so you've got super accurate time sync and then you're able to again broadcast that time to any local devices on your network so that's our kind of easter egg number six pop popular public safety feature and again that's coming out in firmware 8.1.0 you can get that in release candidate today and i think we'll see that ga hopefully before the end of the month here so new functionality that's going to show up real soon i'm realizing that i skipped over number five to the alerts for in control so we're gonna take a step back here i showed you the surprise before i finished number five so again if we go back to the group level we can go under settings and then notifications so we've got all kinds of notification all kinds of events that we can trigger notifications for and you can see at the top here there's multiple tabs so we'll look at that in a second but again similarly to the zero touch policies we used we can choose which devices are going to actually fall under the scope of this rule so again we can use tags or we can do it for all the devices you can if you've got more sensitive devices you can use a tag to monitor them more intensively than you would some other devices that are maybe less important you can set a silent window if there's a particular maintenance window that you know of that's going to kind of trigger some of these events but here's the the different settings you can actually trap for so we've got devices going online and offline you know if you've got again hardwired devices that should never go down you might want to use a tag for that to identify those and say hey if they go offline for more than two minutes let me know right away by default you can use your organization and group admins so you've got a couple canned groups that you can use here or you can just create a policy for custom email addresses you can also use a lot of the carriers have email to sms capabilities so you can check with your carrier on that you can find how to kind of alert your users via sms this way too but again going down the list we've got high availability transitions you can alert lands going up and down speed fusion going up and down speed fusion cloud events that's our new cloud service that kind of helps you not have to do the infrastructure side of speed fusion there's other webinars we can talk about that capability on but again ipsec bandwidth usage this is a this is a really nice one so in the routers config you can set the individual thresholds for sim cards and things like that so you can get alerted if there's overages about to happen if you've got devices that you know shouldn't ever get unplugged from the land air probe is our wi-fi monitoring feature that's a separate product some other useful ones configuration changes being applying being applied if you've got users out there making changes without your knowledge that can be a big problem so you can get alerted anytime a config is changed on any router out in the field so that your administrators know what's going on sim cards switching over sim cards being removed lots of little detailed reports that you can get but again especially in public safety really important information if somebody took your firstnet similar to your router you're definitely going to want to know that so you can get a notice if somebody pops a sim card out now there's lots of nice integration here too you can use this notification url so if you're again on a private network or email might not be available you can use a json format web push to actually send these alerts to another system to listen for that so that you can alert people in more unique scenarios or do more integration with other systems to hook into this and again you can do multiple tabs for these different notifications so that you can create custom policies for each scenario that you're trying to monitor for and make sure that you're alerting the right people in each each scenario so really powerful alerting functionality all built in and included within control [Music] 2. [Music] so that pretty much wraps up the content i'm going to dive into the questions now give me just a second to review some of those so i see the first question about talking about more about lmr interfaces with the peplink products how how would the user when the user pressure presses the push-to-talk button on the lmr radio how does the peplink intercept that and extend the transmission back to the lmr network so what i'm referring to there is a lot of lmr vendors have ip integration uh either adapter boxes or software applications that their native applications that the vendor is like it's already developed to interface the lmr networks to an ip network and so what we're doing is we're not enabling that ip capability on the lmr system but we're protecting it and enhancing it so that it gives them that unbreakable and really clear smooth voice quality experience so you would plug either an lmr to ethernet type of appliance from your vendor into our peplink router and then create a speed fusion tunnel back to wherever your lmr core server might be so that you can protect and do the the packet level sd-wan speed fusion magic with that voice traffic so it's an integration that requires some sort of ip capability from your lmr vendor it's not automatically out of the box going to convert lmr to to an ip network it's just going to protect that ip network for the lmr devices i see another question about the data retention on the gps logs i believe that's 60 days by default i need to go back and double check that but i'll show you real quick there's two ways that you can well there's a couple different ways you can extend that number one you can host are in control management system privately and this is really important for public safety again oftentimes private networks are in play so we make in-control 2 available to users so they can deploy it inside of their private network so if you're not comfortable with the security of a public cloud application no problem you can get a private version of in control 2 run it in your own private network and it's going to completely live in your environment and run on that network so that you don't have to have your devices talking through the internet talking to a remote system that you might not be in control of so we make that option available to our customers so that they can deploy in whatever way they're comfortable with and their security policies require that and that's a very unique capability other other lte router manufacturers don't have that capability to make their their management system completely privatized like that so you can go into a zero internet environment even for license key activation the system doesn't need to talk to the internet so we can go completely dark with our management system and again that's a super powerful capability for public safety but specific to gps it allows you to retain that gps data longer than what the system default might be on the public version now if you are on the public version that's fine too there's lots of ways that you can grab that data before it before it expires so that you can log that or store that so we showed that streaming method so you can stream that to an extra server a third-party server so that it's going to record that but you can also use csv exports either from the the web interface of in control again if we go under the wand quality [Music] reports you can download all that signal and gps data sorry i'll show you that again i don't think i have the right screen on there so we go under the wand quality reports you can download the signal and gps data together with that button or again at the device level view you can download your gpx data there the other option is the in control 2 api so i'm not going to go into much detail on this but the in control 2 api exposes all of this gps data in a way that you can programmatically go in and download if we look at the in control 2 api i'll just really briefly show you where that is just going to say i agree the cool thing about our api documentation here is it's living and breathing so if you've got an in control account you can get a token it will authenticate you'll have to authenticate with your account but then you can actually start testing these these endpoints dynamically so you can actually enter in the data needed to test each of these api endpoints so you can actually get information spit out but again specific to gps you can get all that gps information there there's several different endpoints to either set a location or export that location or just get the current location for all your devices so you've got lots of integration capabilities within control 2. again public safety has lots of systems so making them all talk together so they're not jumping screens all the time is really valuable so there's lots of different ways to ingest that gps data and kind of extend that retention time window so i see some questions about where in control is hosted that's hosted in the us and aws i'm not seeing too many oh i see one other what protocol does in control you use to push the configuration that is called cap lap it's a https like protocol that's designed to program access points so it's an industry standard protocol that we're using to achieve that real time push experience but in an outbound only manner so in control 2 is very nap friendly very friendly to outbound only types of uh sim cards or internet connections but again cap wap is the protocol that we're using to actually do that that push okay i don't see any other questions for today and we have one minute to spare so thank you so much for joining us and be feel free to fire any questions to myself or your account managers if you've got follow-ups thanks again folks"}

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "and thanks for joining this is Travis Derek I'm a product manager here at Peplink and today we're gonna walk you through the upcoming firmware eight point one point zero there's all kinds of cool new stuff in here so I think you guys will enjoy this so as always the mission of Peplink is to deliver unbreakable connectivity anytime anywhere and eight one zero definitely follows that tradition there's all kinds of new features here to help you stay up and stay connected as fast as possible so there's two ways to get the beta firmware you can go to our forum and download it there actually I guess there's three ways you can get it from the forum you can go to our open beta program page on our website just Google Peplink open beta you'll probably find it that way or you can get it directly from in control 2 we'll show you how that works a little bit later in the show so right now this eight one zero firmware is in beta 4 we expect the first release candidate to be launched next week and so almost guaranteed this will be a generally available firmware in July so we're coming coming up real quick on that that being an officially released firmware so I would definitely encourage you to to go check it out and try it now so what's in it the first thing we launch speed fusion cloud back in March and that was a special build firmware and so now eight one zero is gonna be the first generally available firmware that has speed fusion cloud and integrated in it and there's a lot of improvements there so what we'll be doing a live demo a little bit later in the show so you'll get to see what I'm talking about there but lots of enhancements lots of new functionality so I think you'll really appreciate what's what's developed with the speed vision cloud so those that aren't familiar with it the speed fusion cloud is a new service that we launched again in March to let people get the the benefits of speed fusion without having to set up a bunch of their own infrastructure previously to get the benefits of speed fusion you to have either a another router or a fusion hub hosted out in the cloud to allow you to get those SD LAN benefits of speed fusion and so speed fusion cloud takes that away it makes it just a really simple point-and-click type of setup so that you can do bonding failover and all kinds of other different strategies with speed fusion again with this just a single router or if you've got several locations you can connect all of them to speed fusion cloud so it's a subscription service that really makes it much easier to get the benefits of speed fusion and again we'll demonstrate this in a little bit so there's lots of other things to talk about in firmware 8 one zero one really big one is drop-in mode as being supported on all of our products now that used to be either unavailable or a paid add-on for the lower end products and so when you look at something like the br1 Mini all of a sudden that has drop-in mode that enables all kinds of expanded use cases for those lower end products so if you're a managed service provider and you want to come in to bring phone service into a company who's already got an existing network you can protect that phone traffic with the br1 mini you can put it in drop-in mode integrate it really really seamlessly with their existing infrastructure so it gives it gives customers a whole bunch more flexibility on across our entire model line so it's not a segmented feature anymore another unique one is what we're calling our unbreakable time server so there's two layers to this number one the the Peplink routers are now able to serve as an NTP server and so that allows them to be an authoritative time source for any devices on the network so you can think of like IP cameras IP phones and Public Safety obviously this is going to be a big deal for them they've got lots of different systems that need a really accurate time source and so this gives you one rate embedded into the Peplink router the other thing that we've added or expanded is the Peplink router previously would reach out to an upstream ntp server on the internet for its time source and now what we're doing is we're allowing that those devices that have a cellular radio in there with GPS to get the time synchronization directly from GPS as well and so we'll show you how those work a little bit later they're real easy to configure very straightforward but again very powerful feature a lot of companies or again public safety agencies end up buying separate net clock devices and so now this really eliminates the need for that another upgrade we've done is we've added bandwidth bonding to our media fast 500 and 700 routers so again that used to be a paid upgrade that is now included by default with those routers so I'm sure a welcome addition for people that own those products another really unique one is the TCP accelerator support so those of you that deal with things like satellite links are probably very familiar with TCP acceleration and so it's been a request for a long time to enable TCP acceleration on speed fusion so that it can be compatible with more compatible with with things like satellite links and so what we've done in 8 1 0 is we've enabled the TCP sessions to be exposed even though they still remain encrypted so that TCP acceleration that's built into things like satellite modems can work on speed fusion traffic so we'll show you how to configure that a little bit later as well some other really cool things which we're not going to show today but definitely reach out if you've got an interest in using these features we've added some new virtualization options to our products the EPX is now able to run virtual machines and docker so that was a in addition that was planned from the get-go but we finally got that released and then any any media fast product and then a couple of the new products like the mbx have optional capabilities to enable the Hubb feature and so the products that have that content hub feature are now able to do full operating system virtualization so we're utilizing a technology called KVM to virtualize any operating system you want and run that directly on that Peplink router that has the content hub capability so you could run a Windows virtual machine right inside your Peplink router so that you can eliminate the need for additional servers or all additional infrastructure at your customer location this can be very important in harsh environments so like railway projects where industry certifications are a must it's oftentimes much easier to get that virtual machine running on the router that's already certified and ruggedized for those environments so definitely a powerful option for those folks looking to do pretty sophisticated applications another big point of 8 1 0 is upgrading the wireless security capabilities and this extends to both the routers built-in Wi-Fi for those that have it and the AP controller integrated in most of our products as well so WPA 3 is a new white Wi-Fi security standard so any 11ac any routers that have an 11 AC radio in them should support the WPA 3 directly on that built-in access point again all of the access point controllers are able to configure this security setting for access points that are capable of it and you'll start to see this WPA 3 capability show up on our access point products like the 11 AC capable ones in the next firmware version so those of you that have our 11 AC way of to products those already support WPA 3 in the current firmware those of you that have like an AP one Enterprise that's the first generation 11 AC products you'll see a firmware update coming out soon to support WPA 3 on those as well we're also supporting 802 11 W on the Wi-Fi LAN so lots of upgrades on the Wi-Fi technology here another area focused for 8 1 0 is on traffic analysis so we've got a couple different ways this plays out here on the speed fusion side we've got we've we've really enhanced the graphs for speed fusion so you can get a lot deeper information and understanding of what's going on in your speed fusion network so you can better troubleshoot and evaluate the performance of that will show you those a little bit later as always we keep expanding our dpi capabilities so the signature database has grown pretty extensively in this version so you'll you'll find that the the dpi reports and the DPI steering capabilities as well as content blocking capabilities are all a lot more granular now and you'll see a lot more popular applications that that customers have been looking for in there so again we'll show you that as well that flows another one if you know what this is you're probably excited about it if you don't not anything you have to get too worried about but we'll show you how this works in a little bit that flows a lot like deep packet inspection and SNMP so it just sends metadata about all the different traffic utilization on your network to an external server that does its own analysis so it's not a direct feature that Peplink is exposing in the UI but it allows you to send that net flow stream to a third party net flow collector for for larger networks so we'll show you where that lives right now ok so I don't have a whole lot of slides for today I figured it's a lot more valuable for you guys to see how this stuff works in in the router directly so I'm gonna just pause my screen and we'll start pulling up I've got I think 9 different features that I'm gonna show you guys today so just give me a second here okay well we're pulling up our remote web admin on a router and the first thing we're going to show you is the speed fusion cloud again this has been greatly expanded since the first firmware that supported speed fusion cloud and the remote web admin is taking a long time because I'm live on a demo of course so I'll give this just a second okay sorry for the delay folks so the new firmware there's direct there's a new tab at the top of the the router user interface I don't think that's happened for since the max product line came out so kind of a dramatic shift for your eyeballs if you're used to looking at our router interface but there's a lot of great stuff here so the first thing we can do if we look at which locations we want to choose you can select them here so I'm just gonna clear these out and kind of start over so when you first enable speed fusion cloud when you first register that license that's what's gonna expose this tab here so if you haven't done that check our forum out there's a registration process so you can get the demo set up now but once you've done that this tab is going to show up and right away you can just choose which location by default you can just choose automatic it works great it's gonna choose the the closest location to you based on latency but you can also just manually select which locations you want to connect to so I'm just gonna choose you can choose up to three of them I'm gonna choose just a few of them here I'm gonna say Japan New York and let's go to London as well okay so if I click apply changes the routers gonna automatically start establishing connections to all three of those cloud locations another really cool thing you can do though is you can modify these just like you would a normal speed fusion profile so you can create all kinds of different different tunnel profiles that are then gonna be mirrored on the on the other side of the speed fusion cloud so that you get all the performance benefits that you want from each mode so let's say the default tunnel will make hot failover so I'm gonna make my broadband the highest priority and then I've got three cellular interfaces that we can failover to now if you're not very familiar with the connection priority down here that I'll explain how this works if you're choosing links in a certain priority and and then you have a link in another priority the tunnel is only going to actively use whatever links are in the highest priority if you have more than one link in a priority group that means you're basically bonding those links together so in this case we are using just the broadband if that's available and if that fails then we're going to fail over to a bonded cellular connection and so you're actually combining hot failover and bonding in this profile now you can also do things like when smoothing with speed fusion cloud so we're gonna put that at normal so normal if you're not sure about when smoothing you can read the tooltip here basically it's a packet redundancy protocol so that you can lower your average latency for latency sensitive applications like voice over IP and you can basically eliminate packet loss as long as you've got a couple links in play you can you can duplicate your traffic so that you're always getting the best performance on every single packet and you're gonna get completely seamless failover if if one of those links drops you're not even I hear audio drop for a second you can also do forward error correction with speed fusion cloud now so forward error correction is somewhat similar to lan smoothing but it's different in it in another way it's a lot more efficient so your overhead is gonna be a lot lower instead of duplicating your packets you're only generating either 13 or 26 percent overhead so you're sending some parity bits to kind of help you reassemble packets if there's packet loss forward air correction is usually great for video streaming if not is ideal for audio streaming audio is a lot more sensitive to latency usually video streams even live ones have a little bit of buffering in them and so forward air correction needs just a small amount of time just you know we're talking milliseconds to reassemble those packets so again forward error correction usually great for video when smoothing usually more ideal for a real-time voice but again with speed fusion cloud you can now utilize these technologies and again these settings are mirrored on the other side so you've got really easy setup of these some other cool things you can do is you can connect specific devices to the cloud so you can still use the outbound policies to steer traffic to the cloud and we'll show you how that works in a second but you can also just pick individual clients and choose where they where you want them to go so I could send this a p1 over to Japan if I wanted [Music] so you can just it'll automatically populate your client list so you can pick and choose clients and basically and force them to tunnel all their traffic to whichever speed fusion cloud node you want so if you've got a reason to pop up in Japan you can just choose your iPhone or laptop or whatever device and have that all of that devices traffic tunnel to whichever node you choose now if it's a Wi-Fi enabled product you can also do the same strategy with the Wi-Fi networks I'll pull that up in a little bit here on a different model so you can see that but you can create custom SS IDs that are then tunneled to whichever speed fusion cloud node you want so that every device on that particular SSID is going to get tunneled so lots of nice easy quick ways to get devices connected to the speed fusion cloud but again you can also just use your elbow and policies to do the same thing that you're used to doing with normal speed fusion tunnels [Music] I want to point out too we've got our deep packet inspection application steering feature that's been out I think since eight firmware eight zero zero but you need to enable expert mode to expose this capability expert modes already turned on on this router but if it's not on yours you just open this tooltip here and you'll be able to see the expert mode link to enable that once you do that what you're able to do is you're able to use our deep packet inspection technology to steer specific applications to different tunnel profiles so if I say the destination is speed fusion cloud I can say New York City and then I can choose application and so like I said the DPI signatures have expanded greatly in this firmware and so if we look under voice over IP you can see there's several things so it's not just voice over IP it's also like WebEx and zoom Skype so it's a voice over IP and whatever web content sharing platforms you guys are using as well so if we just choose that then I can say I want to send that to I want to send that to my land smoothing profile so that I can guarantee that those streams don't get interrupted and we don't have a bad experience on on a webinar or something like that so that's how you can use those multiple tunnel profiles that you create in the speed fusion cloud the other thing that I want to point out is these application rules are going to assume that you're already sending traffic to that tunnel and then you're further steering it to the right tunnel profile that you created so next I'll show you the speed few the new speed fusion graphs so if you look at the speed fusion status page you're gonna see a normal tunnel that I've got here and then we've got several tunnels and sub tunnels connected to the speed fusion cloud you get the little cloud icon over here so if we start opening these up we'll just take a look so here you can see we've got the hot failover tunnel and so as we told it to it's only using the broadband actively right now and it's got the cellular in standby ready to ready to take over if the broadband were to fail the other profiles we've just got everything in priority one so you can see they're both active at the same time now if we open the graph up you can see some of the new features that are in here so there's a lot more information here which can be a little bit overwhelming but once you know what it is it's super helpful so previously we got the throughput and we got the latency graph and I think we had a packet loss graph now we've got downlink and uplink quality separated right now the links are real stable so we don't have anything showing up there will generate some speed here in a second see if we can't get some get some problems to show up here okay so we got the speed ramping up so we got a few problems starting to show up here you can see we've got packets out of order being identified here so an uplink and downlink status you've got packet fragmentation if you're using forward error correction you'll you'll see dots show up if if forward error correction is actually being utilized if they're having to reassemble packets and you can also see redundant packets from from LAN smoothing as well so again there's a lot more information here and then my favorite view is this all window and this basically shows you all the active links in the tunnel so here you can really start to see on the left you've got the aggregate stats but then you can start peeling it out one one at a time so we can see our broadband link is really clean we're not having any of those airs down here that we see in the aggregate stats so if we scroll over you can see the cellular link not that surprisingly is where we're seeing some of the the problems showing up so again these graphs are excellent for troubleshooting if you click on the export button you'll get a you'll get an image capture of the graphs so that you can very easily show people now there is a lot of data here so these are scalable graphics so you can zoom in and see all the details on each one but really nice easy export capability so that you can capture some evidence if you've got a problem you need to show to somebody else okay the next one I'm gonna show you is drop-in mode on the br1 mini I'm gonna pull that up again and see if remote web admin is gonna be my friend it sure is like I said drop in mode that's being expanded to all of our products so again as an example on the B arrow and mini to use drop in mode for those of you that don't know drop in Mota's turns the router into basically a transparent bridge so if you've got a customer that has like a third-party firewall and they basically like the way their network works right now they don't want to change their existing network but they want to add some sort of Sdn capability now that's where drop-in mode comes in it lets us transparently insert herself into the network without making any changes and then it lets you add on those sd1 benefits to that existing network so this is really common with MPLS connections the customer doesn't want to renumber their network and so we integrate into that that network address scheme using drop-in mode and then we're able to to bond in additional links with speed fusion but to set that up you go to your LAN settings which isn't the most intuitive right away but you see this right here drop-in mode settings that's all of a sudden available it's what you need to do with drop-in mode is if if the customer have if you're on them if your customer has extra public IPS you would just enter an unused public IP here under the LAN settings and then you need to just enter the gateway DNS servers we're not gonna be doing DHCP so there's a there's a bunch of notes here to just take in if you're using this a lot of these settings suddenly aren't relevant and drop in mode because again we're just bridging through we've also got the shared IP option so if your customer doesn't have extra public IPs you can share whatever public IP their firewall might have so that gives you a little bit more flexibility so let's drop in mode next one I'll show you is the NTP server the unbreakable time server okay so here we've got an SD X with the add-on cellular module so we've got a GPS time source coming from this device so again there's two layers to this there's just enabling the NTP server itself this does not require GPS and it's as simple as a one check box you turn it on and the Peplink router will start responding to NTP requests on its LAN IP so it's default gateway address so you don't really have to do much of all anything to get that working now the other option you've got if we go under system and then time you can choose you can now choose where the Peplink gets its time source from so by default it's gonna use a time server and you can use our Peplink time server if you want that's automatic or you can punch in your own custom time server but now you've got two more options you can just strictly use GPS as the time source for the router again you need a product that actually has a cellular radio and GPS radio with antenna attached and you can also use GPS with time server as a fallback so if you're not 100% confident that GPS is always going to be available for that that unit you can prefer to use GPS as the time source and then fallback to an internet-based server so we run into this a lot you know people use private networks quite often in public safety government applications and so those private networks often don't have any internet access by design and so oftentimes those networks don't have a time server on them so there's nowhere to get that time sink from and so if you've got a private network you can still reach GPS that's a that's a one-way that's a one-way stream so it's totally safe to to listen to the GPS time information and use that as your source so again people that have IP cameras they need a really consistent time source so that all of the cameras in one location are going to be on the same exact time Public Safety is a lot of software systems that need accurate time source information so this gives you that capability and much more flexible especially in those private networks and scenarios the next one I'm going to show you is deep packet inspection so deep packet inspection shows up in several places in our in our router I showed you the application steering already that's one place QoS is another place that you'll see deep packet inspection being utilized so if you click to add an application we've got the normal categories you always saw before but underneath those categories there's a lot more applications so we've got twitch VEVO lots of the popular video streaming services again Netflix has been there for a little bit now but lots of different video services under there again if we look under voice over IP that includes things like zoom and WebEx so not just voice over IP but also the web conferencing applications that people like so again lots of new lots of new applications under here got onedrive Google Drive Dropbox now you can also leverage these signatures for content blocking like let's say I just want to block Dropbox I can just come down here choose Dropbox and I can block it it's as easy as that same with Netflix I don't want people at work doing Netflix so we're gonna shut that off as well now the other thing I'll show you with dpi is the DPI reports if you don't know how to turn these on and ic2 you can do this at the device level or at the group level I'll show you at the device level here if you just click Edit you just have to turn that little enable dpi to on not all products support the DPI engine so you'll if you don't see that button there you've probably got a router that doesn't support that now if we go back to the group level you can do this in bulk so if I just click Edit I can check all the boxes and under actions I can click enable dpi so that'll enable it on all the routers that support it in just a couple of clicks instead of having to do it one by one but now that we've got that turned on we can see reports for what we've been up to on this router now once you turn it on its gonna only start collecting data at that point so if you turn it on you're gonna get kind of a disappointing report right away but just give it give it some time what's some lesson traffic build up and these reports should populate I think every hour you'll see these update so by default it's showing you the graph based on percentage of volume traffic volume and then it's grouping by application category so okay so 53% is web traffic and 24% its remote remote access to me that doesn't mean a whole lot it's nice to see a categorized but if we uncheck that box then you're gonna get more details so that web traffic is pretty much all Google I'm a very heavy Google user so that's not surprising we got a lot of SSH on this traffic we got some speedtest.net SSL if you use this app we're ially expanded our dpi applications the the unclassified slice of the pie used to be a lot bigger and so again as you can see we've really really enhanced the the dpi capabilities to make these reports much more meaningful and useful we also do it based on number of packets so depending on the perspective you're trying to look at but again traffic volume is usually what people are most concerned with how much of this or that is being actually consumed on the links so NetFlow again net flow is somewhat similar we don't we're not gonna be able to demonstrate it today but I'll show you how to configure it you need to go to our not-so-secret support cgi page if you haven't been here it's kind of an ugly page because there's all kinds of stuff that we haven't necessarily integrated into the GUI is where some of the more hidden features are shown and right at the very bottom here we've got net flow we can just click on that we can enable it and again net flow you're sending it to an external net flow receiver or net flow server and so you're gonna choose whichever whichever version and protocol is appropriate tell it where the where that server lives and it's gonna stream that net flow data to that external device there's not a lot to setup there and there's not a lot to see there unless you've gotten that flow server to actually digest all that information the next one I will show you is the TCP acceleration so we're not except we're not directly doing TCP acceleration and speed fusion I'm gonna actually delete this profile and start over so you can see because it's all hidden by default okay by default you're just gonna see this data port auto or custom if you open that little tooltip there you can configure which data stream protocol you're going to use you can switch it to tcp mode and then this little checkbox exposes the TCP headers so previously if you don't check that box even the TCP headers are going to be encrypted if you check the box we will expose the TCP headers but the data packet payload is the payload of the data packet is still encrypted so you're exposing a little bit of information to the network which allows those third party external TCP accelerators to actually work and accelerate all of the encrypted traffic now you're gonna need to that this will also expose all of the TCP ports for the source and destination for each session so if you've got a fusion hub that's heavily locked down you're gonna need to open the firewall up quite a bit on that to accommodate all those all those TCP sessions that are suddenly being exposed it's not going to be limited to just the the port's that you're establishing the tunnel with anymore when you expose those TCP sessions okay I'm going to show you WPA three support now I think this was the router that was giving me trouble earlier we've got a bad router in the demo pool here or a router on a bad connection I should say we'll take a look at another one and show you the controller side first at least so we look at the AP controller on this SD X we can turn that on and under wireless SSID we'll create a new one and so the controller now supports WPA 3 profiles this would require an access point that also supports WPA 3 so again right now all of our wave 2 access points support that in firmware today all of the 11ac products will also support that in a future release I think there should be a beta of that ap firmware very soon so you'll be able to try that out on most of our modern Wi-Fi access points but it's not a lot different than WPA 2 or 1 it's just more secure so the set up is really not any different you just select the mode you want enter your key in you know we've got the fast roaming support so you can get enterprise-grade handoff between access points that's been there for a little bit and so that covers WPA 3 let's see if this other one popped up I don't think so it's trying to load but I've got this on a cellular connection with poor for signal there we go cool so I've got a profile in here WPA 3 test you can see it's set to WPA 3 personal and so this is a balance 20x one of our new products this has built in wave 2 Wi-Fi so this product already by default supports WPA 3 on its integrated access point and so you can see that's being broadcast right there so the last thing I'll show you here again we don't have a net flow server stood up and running so you can just see here is an example of a third party net flow analyzer interface so again it's gonna be somewhat similar to what we showed you in the DPI reports but net flow is a much more scalable enterprise or service provider oriented way to keep track of all your traffic flows across all your different locations and routers and devices so that covers all the demo content and slides for today I'm gonna just dig into some of the questions here give me just a second and we'll see what see what people are curious about okay the first question what models supports speed fusion cloud I love this question because it's easy all of our all of our products support speed fusion cloud except for fusion hub fusion hubs already in the cloud so that doesn't connect to speed fusion cloud itself but you can connect a router to one of your own fusion hubs and speed fusion cloud simultaneously if you so choose to see another question can you have more than one cellular connection up simultaneously I'm assuming that question is referring to a speed fusion either speed fusion cloud or regular speed fusion profile and the answer is yes if you have a product that supports bonding so you need a router that supports speed fusion bonding and again like I showed in the in the GUI you just need to set those cellular connections to the same priority group inside of that speed fusion profile so any connections you link in the same priority group will be bonded together can the GPS info be used to update time zone automatically based on location coordinates so NTP is gonna only tell you what the UTC time is and then it's up to the device to actually set its own time zone so an NTP server won't set a time zone for a device again you have to tell the device what time zone that's in so for third-party devices the answer to that is no for mobile devices like a max router if you've got a max router that's kind of trotting the globe I'm not sure on that one you might that that's an interesting thought if you've got something that's kind of on a ship or something do you I assume the question is can you get the router to kind of change its timezone relative to where it's located at that time I'm not sure on that I think the answer to that is probably no though which models support the NTP server functionality all the models support that and then the GPS time sink like I said you have to have a product with cellular radio and GPS radio on there to get that GPS time sync but you don't need that for the NTP server functionality question on do we recommend setting up WPA 3 or WPA 3 verse 3/2 for current devices I'm I unfortunately am NOT probably the most informed person to advise you on that you know WPA 3/2 is definitely going to work better for compatibility I'm not sure if there are significant trade-offs there from a security perspective as opposed to just running in a pure WPA 3 mode pure WPA 3 is obviously going to limit some client devices there's going to be certainly client devices that don't support WPA 3 so if you go purely WPA 3 you very likely will have some sort of compatibility issues to deal with but again I can't advise you whether or not that trade-off is worth it compared to whatever kind of security trade-offs you might have by doing the mixed mode WPA 3 and WPA 2 another question is asking for a use case for speed fusion cloud so again speed fusion cloud is just taking the infrastructure out of out of people's hands so that you can rapidly deploy speed fusion sd1 without having to set up the infrastructure side so there's lots of benefits right if you want to protect voice over IP traffic if you want to get faster uploads to a Google Drive or Dropbox if you're a video streamer and you travel all over the world you're gonna want to connect to different cloud nodes regardless of where you're at instead of having to set up nodes all around the world so those are some examples of reasons you might use the speed fusion cloud but in short it's just to be able to get the benefits of speed fusion without having to set up that remote side of it it's just automating that whole that whole set up process for you so I don't see any other questions I can give it another 15 or 30 seconds here see if there's any more that pop up all right other than that here's some links to all of our socials and as always check out our forum there's so much good information in there alright folks thanks for joining us take care"}

industry that stands for banking financial services and insurance and the reason we chose this topic was actually based on our partner demand many of our partners have been asking for our specific solutions tailored to the banking and finance industry and we hear you you listen to all of your comments and we want to work with you to make sure you offer the best available option in the world to your clients so let's start what is the Peplink mission what are we trying to achieve with our portfolio of products and solutions we're the unbreakable connectivity company we offer a solution anytime anywhere and that means wherever your client may be located within their region we will work with the best of available options at that point in time using the best available solutions available in the market and we will be able to deliver a working solution and you will see as we break down this very interesting case today before I start I really want to thank the partner we developed this it's incredible amount of work and you see in a second so our case was for a banking client and their core focus was to bring their enterprise into the 21st century of cloud-based core banking so let's take a look at what they had prior to the public solution we have a client that's looking for a resilient and unbreakable private bank network set up and here's our client profile they are a regional bank and they want to develop their own private banking network their specialty was to provide banking services to areas in the region for business and the community but they undergo a lot of challenges such as the availability of infrastructure they literally open brand-new branches with zero networking that means no landline no fiber-optic Novi Sad nothing they were completely in the dark and cut off from their network just posed another problem it compromised their ability to backup their data with low-tech solutions they literally have to backup the data from each branch on to a removable medium such as USB removable hard drive cd-rom DVD roms etc and transported physically to the main branch for backup and data sharing of course this poses a completely insecured solution that can compromise their data sets but that's not all for the branches that actually have some form of connectivity they were limited to basic IPSec and this is a very difficult and set of solution on a per branch basis not only was a difficulty set up advantage they were experiencing very limited bandwidth and performance they also were experiencing difficulties in scaling because of the difficulty of setting it up with a very primitive network technology and in lack clarity of visibility into the network you're unable to see which branch is doing what and they have to manually configure each branch or per pair for connection and last but not least they were severely vendor challenged if they had any availability of any networking it was all provided by one single provider network that single provider only offered only one option per region per area or per city so you can imagine you have a single provider that only give you one option Jung no choice it was either ticket or leader there was no resilience and inability to scale this will create severe downtime if the provider is experiencing an outage which would result in a branch going completely offline in dark and last but not least there is no way for the client to go into the market and take advantage of competitive costing now I want to ask all my partners and participants in the room right now if you were to partner and you've met this client what type of solution would you advise them given that they have a single headquarter branch they have many emotinal remote branches some had no way to produce in connectivity some have a single provider with an archaic ip6 system what kind of advice would you give to this client to bring them into the 21st century if you know you can type in your suggestions into the chat room and go share it with our audience someone says SDM any other ideas and if you don't know can you guess who the competitors were competing to develop a solution for our customer Marcus says look at using SD win with a virtual data center home that's not a bad suggestion can everybody think who our competitors may be looking to provide a solution to this client I won't mention the name on the airplane you can type in what you think or who you think would participate in such a solution michael mpls possibly that is a possible competitor Daniel you would recommend a central fusion home with br1 models per sigh okay okay let's keep it rolling so before I want to proceed I want to tell you who what our competitive analysis was for this special project we have multiple sites lack of industry lack of infrastructure single provider network very difficult IPSec VPN if any networking connectivity the answer is none there was only one provider that stepped up and was able to offer a solution to our client and I could not believe this when I first found out there is no competitor able to offer any proposal for our client this was how difficult their requirements were so let's take a look at what our partner did and let's break down their solution they offered a multi-point multi-phase system to take a banking network from near-zero into a showcase for the entire region so first phase one we will need to implement some form of esteem win and do a demonstration to certify that it actually works that is correct Marcus no other vendor is able to provide a solution so here's what they did they took a single branch they chose one branch that was completely disconnected off the grid no network connectivity whatsoever and they implemented appeal see and this is how he did it they brought in a new 4G LTE solution with external antennas one and two and they chose whatever the two best isp were available at that time for that specific branch they place the SIM cards in our devices and then when the branch was online within minutes this allowed them to create a twin when solution bonded with resiliency security and performance no other providers stepped up at that moment they spent a week doing validation tests that includes performance testing packet loss quality of service thrown PUD and certain etc they plugged in everything Indian at one branch and push that data network back to their headquarters for a week well let me ask you if you're able to do that on day zero for your client who had no connectivity what would be the next steps to continue the validation for my partners you know what would you think would be the next steps they spent one week doing a twin 4G LTE solution with external high gain antennas across the two best ISP for that specific patch so let's see what they did they were so happy with the solution after one week they did a full Enterprise rollout across every single branch they added a Peplink st man solution to any branch that had a in existing primary when and supplemented that such as MPLS 4G LTE fiber-optic DSL etc for branches that had zero connectivity they would install high gain antennas for a twin 4G LTE solution and what the experience was the benefits of speed fusion bonding and hot failover if one of the network's went down for our brand they have a second theory when that would turn on and then keep them online and when that primary wind comes back online it would be dynamically added back to the total performance package for that branch so I will tell you at every single branch they are not using a unified system there are sharing multiple MSPs or is peace across the region to develop the best of connectivity per brand and because of speed fusion bonding and failover we were able to offer a secured and resilient and high performance option that no other vendor MSP ISP or provider were able to offer so that was phase one this was deployed across every single branch back to the headquarter in a star topology now let me ask my partner's what would be the secondary phase if you're bringing a bank from zero to connectivity to a full service modern day that were banking system what would you add to make this even better a doe recovery from Michael traffic Martine and remote management security features well those are all good suggestions but let's look at what they did now they took a complete Bank network that was nearly offline and they just brought it completely online they were able to share resources they were able to do backups they were able to communicate with each other they were able to have real-time voice over IP plus CCTV backhaul plus video conferencing what else do they need for a small bank and come into the 21st century well what about offering extending their banking service outside of the branch sakta existing network provider and employ coupling partner maybe so for phase 2 they have to build the cloud based banking core so that already tells you their him they have to build up the cloud infrastructure only when they were able to show and demonstrate that their banks from nothing into fully modernized network banking are they able to look at the next step which is to bring into cloud components and that offers them near unlimited scalability and let's look at what our provider did for them it will set up in primary data center in one of the cities surrounding many of the branches that makes sense because of latency en locality they set up a secondary data center for back on the they combine the two data centers into a virtual network using a redundant IPSec VPN and this was mainly can meet the data center requirements and probably what was offered by the provider at that time they also set up a third data center back on the core and what would they use this for this was an offshore backup data center attached to the primary data centers with dedicated leased lines and they offloaded the two primary data centers for voice over IP primary server management so now they've built a secondary face very modern and super redundant cloud based banking core they have a fully networked branch to branch system and they have a fully secured data center century banking core now let me ask my partners what else would you bring into the picture to make this a truly magnificent set up Marcus you are correct you said the third data center can be used for a proof of concept development before sending services live to the other data center that is absolutely correct with them with triple redundant data centers you're able to do live testing before you offer extended services such as SAS or banking services as a service and let's show you what our partner did in phase three in phase three they wanted to unify the entire banking network into a single system they added fusion hub right in front of the two primary data centers that will allow them to create a parallel network into the cloud on within a secure VPN solution from Kepler the next step was to bring in all the branches that means the entire banking network and create a live connection into the data center core and there you go they created a speed fusion VPN extension to the entire regional banking network but that's not all what if you wanted to now offer extended banking services outside of a branch such as remote ATM ADM on-site and other campuses shopping mall what if you wanted to extend banking services such as points of sales and transactions you can our partner was able to help our client develop internet to internet banking services including payments and remittance channels all privatized with inexp fusion secured network and I want to answer pandyas question he said in this use case in a remote location where it is suggested to use do sim what if the signal strength of both the sim service providers is very low well if the sim signal strength is very low you can actually increase by aggregating more sim you're not limited to only one or two with a peb link solution I'm gonna show you devices that allow you to scale up until a reasonable amount of performance that you can provide to your customer and outside of this specific case we've actually done this globally and worldwide for other partners and end-users as well so what did our partner really do they took a completely world banking system that worked with remote partners and remote branches and brought them into a showcase for the region for all existing banks they were able to one centralized network management for the entire network through our Sdn controller you get full network visibility including GPS location or tracking of each chair you also are able to immediately trouble Sheen from the centralized IT team from the bank down to each branch down to per device we did not also compromise any security we offer a full 80s 256-bit encryption from end to end for every single peer next we offer Network resiliency through hot failover over multiple lan solution per site per tier if any of those links went down you those sites and devices and services will stay online so the bank is fully operational another benefit is that using a full stack cabling solution is that we completely simplified when architecture why no longer do we have to deal with multiple vendors different systems and integration we have a single four stack solution that's completely transparent and easy to set up and manage and to fix if need be and last but not least we gave them a benefit that many of the existing banks that were online were unable to do we accelerated their entire branch development for modern full-service benefits to customers and internal banking teams such as online banking network internal and consumer Wi-Fi services real time high quality resilient voice over IP and videoconferencing Rio Tybalt data back call CCTV security camera streaming and etc we took one bang offering simple services into a complete showcase and I will add one more thing this bank gain an award for a technology recommendation because they were able to deliver a full stack solution than many of the more higher quality and more competitive and bigger banks were unable to offer in terms of full stack servicing so what kind of solution was offered first I already mentioned we offer a full stack solution from Epling we start down here with our machine intelligence built into every device every virtual device we call that speed fusion technology and that is the underlying tag that powers up and enables our partners to deliver a realizable solution to their clients we also have a wide range of devices specifically designed for different sizes and usage to create the perfect network architecture from headquarters to main branch the remote branches and integrated devices such as atm we also supplement that with virtual appliances where it makes sense to not put in an hardware device so you get Network agility and you can add and expand your network as an EP and last but not least as I mentioned we offer a completely transparent and full visibility into the network with an easy to access anywhere access cloud base as the UN controller that we call in control - so let's look at a speech feature in technology what makes it special we start with a pet VPN this is our proprietary 256 bit AES encrypted VPN technology for a point-to-point we offer a hot failover service that the ability to switch from one way to the next win on a per packet level creating a seamless solution for any network peer that you used under the peppering umbrella we also offer when it's moving technology the ability to use many wins and create a high quality jitter free data stream for voice video VR and even augmented reality in the future unless but not least when capsulate and utilize every bit of power that your client has paid for in the form of combined bandwidth for every single win that you attach into the network but let's focus on what really makes it special for banking customers besides the number one which is security number two must be resiliency we offer the hot failover service the ability to take one or many wins and switch over seamlessly to a physical win or tunnel uninterrupted keeping the bank fully online you can imagine just bank transactions customer service consumer Wi-Fi service and any other critical infrastructure servicing that the bank needs to provide that's their bread and butter and that's what keeps them in business it's important that they stay online after being secured next then with bonding that's basically bandwidth on demand we allow our customer the ability now to walk away from a single provider and to shop around and use the market to their advantage they can look at the market and update their when first sight per device on a quarterly basis and your basis even down to a monthly basis this will help them find the best partners in the industry to ensure that they are being properly served and it can scale nearly indefinitely using our win bonding technology just come does combine and add in any new available technology and aggregate that bandwidth into the system if you don't need it guess what you can also do the exact opposite and scale down or move branches to a new network so let's look at some of the devices that I would recommend today that can be available then this would apply right now if my partner is asking well what kind of solutions can you offer and recommend and how do we apply it so let's start with the headquarters if you're looking at a scalable solution we would recommend you look at the EPS or extreme performance SVN platform highlights include 40 gigabits of extreme bandwidth for data backup and replication it has ultra-high performance to accommodate peers from across the globe not only locked down to your region we offer a we offer the ability to allow you to design the perfect system including designing a hybrid core router and switch configuration and it's modular you can design and grow as you go a field you ask the question if the customer asks for PCI compliance well that depends on a per region and yes we do we offer devices with Phipps compliance if you need ask your Peplink partners such as vad or marketing team about it if you don't know next what kind of module expansion can I look look forward to to help my banking customers stay ahead of the curve and keep them updated let's start with cellular modules so we have triple 14 OTE a module in cat 6 and cat 12 and twin Delta a cat 18 so what are the differences a cat 6 in cat 12 4G modem when using two by two antenna system so you can count it there's two to to promote him this is a GPS connector in a 4x4 my mph or 1018 it's one two three four that's four antennas her modem if you look at a total growth role put the chat six will give you 300 megabits for modems so that's the nine hundred megabits of download 150 megabits and upload that 12 will give you about 1.8 Giga bits at peak download roughly about 450 upload and a cat 18 while only has two modems gives you nearly 2.4 gigabits of throw plate willful on 300 megabits of upload now if you could ask me how are we going to ever achieve the peak numbers you really need to be very close to the cell tower but the thing to consider is how many providers do you have and the quality of their signal and it is smart for you to look into your region and see you even have kept 18 services the advantage of a campaign team that is used by using 4 and 10 assists ami you're able to pick up more radio frequency signals out of the air at that moment in time that means you can increase the performance if your ISP offers a cat 18 service or if it offers in the frequencies within that area also cat 18 offers five carrier aggregation of his five different frequencies that it can combine now you really need to do your homework and check with your provider see if they offer that but that is one of the advantages of going to do cat 18 versus a triple got 12 well what about if my region has even better technology if you're talking about 5g we've got you covered we offer a twin 5g module 25g modem module for the EP X that's either two 5g cellular modules or a 5d plus a cat for a cat 1840 of EI o are four by four mile and the performance would really depend on how close you are to that cell tower now for LAN and when needs we have an 8 gig Ethernet p OE plus module these are LAN LAN switchable per port up to 1 Giga bits per port and p OE 80 or AF and you can switch every single port on an off p OE on and off and etc for cascading or connecting two core switches we do offer a quad SFP+ module then these are LAN LAN switchable per port as well now what about medium ranches we will recommend something like an SD X and this is my award-winning and one of my best sellers I have banking customers right now logged in and banking partners who have two points you know who you are the SDX offers high performance up to 12 Giga bits for large branches it does offer the same modular expansion as an EBX so you can grow as you go but it is super we're agnostic because it already has two sfp+ ports two Ethernet ports you can Ethernet ports and two USB ports form when connectivity you can mix and match and create the best of at that point in time and at that site and it supports high availability so you can link to for extra redundancy so what about a smaller branch let's take a look we can recommend based on the case then we've just shown you to take a look at the MDX this is our upgradable quad cellular gigabit LTE powerhouse mbx has up to four 4G LTE modems for maximum wireless performance today you can bring your clients branches remote sites online on day zero without any physical landline plug in SIM cards turn it on you can also scale into the future when you have hard lines available through our additional land ports one two and three or even USB for temporary wins and you offer investment protection riffing five teen pathway to grow in the future you can swap out the entire modem model a modem module on the back and replace it with a 5g compliant module if you have a 5g use case you can email marketing and we will be glad to work with you on this and what about smaller pop up branches or remote branches or temporary branches what would you recommend for my banking customer well for those types of use cases usually been with us not really the biggest concern that number one concern is security number two is resiliency but number three is priority of transaction packets I would recommend you take a good look at the UBR LTE why one it is a unique business model because it is available under an X subscription that means you pay upfront a fraction of the cost instead of buying this out in the first year you can pay as you go every year and use it it also has all the speed fusion benefits including bonding when smoothing and hot failover but more importantly it offers a network of redundancy and secured VPN for points of sales and it's versatile has two built-in 4G LTE modems plus an additional wind port if you want to bring in in other win options and of course you can configure the built-in Wi-Fi as when as well last but not least what about integration what if I have dedicated transaction devices if I just need to set it and forget it let me introduce the speak Asian engine this is a very small form factor and low-power item for super easy integration you can plug this into a system bolt it down and just turn it on and forget about it it has two built-in 4G LTE four unbreakable bond again after failover it has built-in traffic fearing to prioritize all transactions above any other network traffic usually that's what ATMs would be requiring and it does offer a built-in GPS to ensure that you know where that device is anytime and for security monitoring and how would a typical network look like outside of my specific network that we showed previously let's look at a hypothetical network you would have when edge device whether it's wireless or wired at the remote site or branch we would enable the Peplink proprietary speed fusion bonding and we would encapsulate create a super fast high bandwidth high quality connection back to a your headquarters through a wired device via hardware or possibly be we can wire and direct all that traffic to a cloud-based virtual appliance in the cloud and then we can do segmentation of traffic can we keep the traffic within the network or do we segment an off-ramp non-essential traffic such as internet or surfing needs from consumers and we can be land all that off and segmented to protect your network so this is what we can do with a complete full stack solution today go further security resiliency high performance 5g ready performance today we're 5g is not available and a virtual outlet if need be so I want to just summarize what other benefits that Peplink can bring to the table that makes it specifically viable and applicable towards banking solutions I mean everything I just said can be technically applied to any other Enterprise I'm glad you asked well before I do so let's talk about Fusion honey so fusion hub is a virtual device it is installed onto a server it can be run in a hypervisor under voltaire Microsoft its journey Amazon Web Services Google cloud or you can roll your own other VMware it is a virtual appliance installed on a server that will establish a speed fusion connection between cloud and physical coupling devices so as I shown in my case we use that to bring in all the branches into a secure cloud-based network as the Gateway it's available at different sizes and instances so you buy what you need you can also run a demo for 30 days just to test drive it you can deploy it easily because you can literally log into your cloud provider can download an image and spin that up and it's easy for you to control your infrastructure because you could deploy an app as a POC before you put in or consider a hardware device as a permanent on-premise device lastly built-in full-featured UI easy to set up no IPSec headaches you can do tunneling and outbound policy set up and you can set a fusion hub as the primary public IP address open gateway into your network instead of compromising a hardware somewhere else now let's look at more banking's specific benefits from Peplink so we're able to do something that's really cool and applicable to our client and that's sub tunnels within an existing speed fusion tunnel we've created a point-to-point system will be single speed vision tunnel let's pretend this is a branch and this is the headquarters you can create different tunnels within the tunnel to traffic scary for example you can create a data priority set you can create a voice IP voice over IP tunnel video streaming tunnel market internal sales tunnel or you have backhaul tunnel you can deploy different policies with separate tunnels not affecting the other policies we also offer high available for our devices that gives you peace of mind with extra redundancy at the branch headquarter and data center levels a very important feature is that with Peplink you can set up an on-call disaster recovery site so what is that imagine if you set up a complete speed fusion network and what if your headquarter went down what would happen to all your branches at that instance does it go down in the dark or does it try to find another head unit to connect to with disaster recovery support you can set up and on standby pier to become the head unit if the primary goes down and this is all live and on standby this is not a cold spin up you can set a disaster recovery at a major branch central branch or even add the data center so this will allow at least some form of resiliency in a star type topology or a segmented Network and many of our banking customers love this additional feature without having to set up a separate parallel network with a separate different set of configuration settings unless they're not least when you have a modern showcase ready banking system you do want to provide even more benefits and extend that down to your consumers we offer guest protection to your private network by the landing and submitting their services separately from the private banking network you can share the same ApS within the branch and segment and network via SSID or you can even go down to the hardware level and separate separate consumer services down to the per port and off ramp that back to the internet love ever going into your private banking network so these are all features that are very important security and banking specific customer now that wraps it up for our case study we shown you a triple phase from dark branches all the way to online from cloud-based cord network setup plus full extended banking services to third party from who from one partner from coupling we were the only vendor partner now can offer such a solution from zero to showcase an award-winning system in the region so now I will take your Q&A questions if you have any you can ask me about the network topology you can ask me about the benefits how to do it I will answer as many questions as I can without the bulging or breaking any MVA and I'll give you a minute to type in all your questions and I will go through all of them very shortly thank you okay I'm gonna start answering questions now from Marcus when talking about multiple tunnels within the speed fusion link are you referring to two separate layers from feelings that is correct Marcus within every peer for speed fusion tunnel you can set some tunnels and sub tunnels will apply speed fusion benefits to specific traffic's so let's pretend I created a speed fusion peer-to-peer link between one branch to the headquarter but I want their fred policies based on layer 3 let's say traffic let's say I want voice over IP traffic to have a certain amount of bandwidth or a certain amount of quality applied to it and I want to designate which ran points I can create a tunnel for that traffic it'll only apply to that type of traffic and then I could create another one for data for example and I created another one for that calling or I can create another one for video conferencing from Michael how many Open VPN users can support in the fusion zone that's actually a great question I actually do not know that answer but if you check the speed fusion spec sheet it will tell you and yes we do support Open VPN lttp and I be believe IP said for users to connect into the network from Michael wheeler during the POC of a successful banking clan was there a remote branch that only have edge connectivity how do you solve this challenge okay that's a great question Michael so let me go back a little bit so you have a one headquarter branch that was the biggest branch in the region and you had a remote branch and our partner chose the branch that had not zero they were unable to even buy internet service for that branch that's how far away they were they used a multi or G LTE solution with different providers that is key you don't use the same provider with multiple 4G LTE solution use their friend is P or MSP with multiple 4G and they were able to create a bonded connection and then they connected that in a main range now if you have a branch with a single when edge connectivity that means a sweet ending of MPLS or you have some kind of fiber-optic or whatever you can inline that when into our device on the way apart and then add either physical win or 4G LTE on top and then you bond that connection into a single virtual connection back to the main headquarter branch if you would like more examples of that please send me an email at sales I felt like a comment I would be glad to showcase that or you can join our forum and we our partners can actually shared case studies and their work topology with you and Marcus there are some case studies on the pebbly website does this presentation relate to you one of those specifically the answer is none none zero this is a brand new case that we've never shown this case is actually under NDA I office Kate it a lot of details but I will share with you for any network engineer when you look at that detail connectivity map that I show you can actually understand exactly what's going on down take a device level I've shown you the critical points which which was to put a fusion hub in front of the firewall that goes into the data center and from that point you connect all bank to bank in branch network plus extending data center out to third party transactions servicing and etc oh Michael what you meant is there is no 4G but there's only one G what we can do is we have to look at what's available in your region Michael for example if you don't have 4G we can look at V Seth and we've done that with many customers we're able to aggregate multiple VSAT connections into an existing LAN connection as primary or a secondary or as supplement but what you should do is for your specific cases tell me what you have available in your region and our technical team can work with you to design something that's feasible and we can work with you to set up a P and C just to prove that point before there are any commitments from your customer now there are no more questions and yes the case that you will be amazed available for everybody to analyze with the video okay there is a question in Q&A so I'm gonna copy this question into the chat box if I can't I can't so here let me read it out loud is in the Q&A section regarding Ben with bonding what if we combine two ends using cable FTTH and satellite what will the performance become because ping latency of the satellite would be much higher than the FTTH that is absolutely correct so Joe key your question if you combining two high-speed landline fiber or copper then you add a high latency V set what you can do is a you can set a latency cutoff and you can apply that policy to specific traffic or B you can create a policy to integrate everything where is not latency specific let's say after our banking backup do you really care about latency then not really unless you're talking about CCTV for example what if you just want to backup all data transactions from the day and just send it back to the data center for backup and redundancy you don't really care about the latency you can just combine all the wins and send the data as fast as possible when it gets there our technology when we combine all the data into seamless streams and save it if you're talking about CCTV voice over IP any time that's latency sensitive you can set the latency cutoff and speed fusion will automatically not use a high latency when you can do that automatically or you can set a manual policy and just fix it so it really depends on what you want to do hi Marcus you had a really great question in Australia thanks for closing branches due to people moving online one thing even announced that the Graduate decommissioning of ATMs as cash is getting use less how would you sell solution to the market okay so everything's going cow base right and everybody is using a redundant setup basically through mobile phones okay so my answer to that would be a if every customer is pounding on the network trying to get banking services where it is a scalability limitation going to be it's going to be at the data center right but you still need any front-end and at that front end you still have the managing you can still use a speed fusion system for what management quality of service what if you're even if you're doing just peer transactions let's say at the busiest time of day and you over saturate that network how will the banking service team even know they have a problem they don't without sophisticated reporting I see two offers amateur reporting mechanisms that you can monitor on a part-time basis to see the quality of your service just by monitoring the devices and also what about one of the most critical systems in the world what is that hot line usage what if I cannot access my account and I need to call somebody that call center will still benefit from speed fusion because that is the lifeline to every business the phone number is still the primary lifeline for a business to touch and work with their consumers if you don't have that system in place I will let you compare a bank that has no voice customer service versus peer internet banking I will tell you the best things in the world still have a voice outlet for their consumers and are able to monitor and troubleshoot their banking system in real time hi Gann how can this solution apply to ATM well we're actually we actually have a future webinar already designed to talk about ATM integration but I will tell you to look at speed fusion engine and if you really want us to kick off that next webinar very soon please everybody in the audience fill out the feedback form at the end of the webinar and tell us you want to see it and we will push up that schedule and deliver the ATM thank you solution for you and I think that wraps it up I want to finalize and say thank you everybody for your time is greatly appreciated your support is required for us to continue to do these webinars you could come visit us on our website and follow up and see all the new cool products that we're checking out soon more importantly you can follow us on LinkedIn and social media such as Facebook and watch the webinars on a youtube channel but probably the most important thing is participate in our forum and please fill out the feedback or tell us what you like tell us what you didn't like if you tell us what you didn't like please be specific don't say the webinar was not so good we cannot improve if we do not know and thank you everybody for your time and thank my partner for an incredible deployment that was showcase and award-winning really have to hand it to you buddy have a great morning you're the great afternoon and I will see you all at the next webinar thank you"}

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "next we're going to talk about wine quality reports so when quality reports are done at the device level so if we drill into this 1350 here and go to the reports you can see when quality reports show us up on that list so when quality reports tracks every act of land on on any given router whether it's an Ethernet connection or an LTE connection we track quality metrics for those lands and roll all that information up to in control - so for this particular router it only has one Ethernet LAN and so this is on a cable modem connection and as we see we're on worse we're selected today's date we've chosen one one by default it's gonna show you 30 minutes of time pretty mundane right I've got about thirty to forty milliseconds of latency looks real stable right everything's great we can widen that view out click on all you can see something happened right around five a.m. latency wasn't terrible before but higher for sure kind of in the 40 to 60 millisecond range sometime right around 5 a.m. things kind of smooth out and leveled off right around 30 milliseconds see we get a couple spikes big and this is all pretty pretty small stuff 30 to 50 millisecond latency no big deal [Music] we get a lot of support tickets on our side from customers who are complaining oh I've got you know voice quality issues or you know my customers internet connection or my customers complaining of slow speeds so this is a great first place to start looking at is just drill down into the individual land connections for that customer and start looking to see you know maybe there aren't large latency spikes I know we've seen that many times where you get voice quality complaints and you come and look at the wind quality reports and yeah there's not a lot of quality happening on there when seeing large latency spikes lots of varied activity so these are good places to dig for data or clues to figure out what might be causing a customer's issue and if you are seeing low quality performance on particular wins that's where you can start looking at speed fusion as a way to help work around some of those issues so there's not a lot of data to look at necessarily on a wired connection definitely very useful but pretty simple and straightforward if we go to an LTE based connection we can start to see a lot more information show up so for this particular unit I'm gonna go to a day that I know this was moving around so I'm going to February fit and so here we can see a lot more complicated graph a lot more data on the graph showing up here so you can see the carrier with that AT&T you can see the LTE ban is being used band 12 and then you can see the different signal metrics you can see the RS RQ you can also download this information so if you click on this download as CSV will let that download you can see there's quite a bit of data or ticking up at 700 probably almost a Meg of data there so lots of data points and will convert this to a Google sheet so you can read it a little easier there's tons of data that we're grabbing with respect to the cellular connection quality over time so you're getting all kinds of data points you get the length latency you get our SRP seiner our SRQ you get all the all irrelevant signal metrics you get the location timestamp you've got tons of raw data if you want to turn this into some other sort of report or import it into some other system you've got all kinds of data to work with here just a couple clicks so again I can switch to different wounds I think cellular 2 is AT&T as well if we go to cell you only three I think that was a different carrier okay so here we've got Verizon again you've got all that data mapped out over time you can see different events at the top land downwind up so if you lose a connection offline and online that's when the router is booting up or or shutting down so you've got lots of nice flags here to show you different events now looking at a graph of cellular signal data can get boring real fast and so what I think is the more useful perspective is the map view so like I said on this day we're driving for considerable amount of time so here you can see we're on Verizon and here you can see that all those readings kind of smoothed out over the course of that that trip and so in general this is pretty good connectivity if we click on any one of these you can see that individual records that make up that that dot if you click on the details you can see all those specific readings so you can see there's a couple in there that aren't that great but in total they average out pretty good now if we want to zoom in you can see those individual plots in a more granular fashion you can start to zero in on where your coverage is coverage issues might be or your signal quality issues might might exist so here we can see this is where the quality starting to degrade so you get some clues from the larger view but then as you as you drill down you can really start to break out where those trouble spots might be so that's Verizon let's switch carriers again and just see what the map view looks like for a couple other carriers this one is t-mobile so again there's mostly good mostly good coverage on this route there's a couple spots that look a little more glaring than Verizon stit but all in all pretty isolated stuff now we can use these tools up here to start drilling in and looking for more specific issues or different different metrics so we take away the strength and the quality we can look at just the latency so if we look at latency less than 500 milliseconds that's good performance in general if we look at over 500 milliseconds there's where we can see the user is actually experiencing an impact of their traffic so in all of these areas these are areas where our our latency metric recorded higher than 500 milliseconds so that's where you're going to start to see the performance really degrade for you now you can change that threshold if you want if 500 isn't the right perspective let's turn it up okay so now here's over a thousand milliseconds so these are getting to be pretty terrible in terms of user experience so you can start to really zero in on particular areas where you're getting a bad user experience and so in this case you can see the strength is very poor the quality is very poor and the latency is very poor I'll strength to begin with antennas are about the only thing you can do to really improve that so that's not necessarily a carrier fault carrier issue that might just be you don't have enough antenna to really make the connection work well in that location now in this location you can see signal strength is very good the quality is very good but the latency is really high so this is more of a carrier sight issue it doesn't look like there's much you do to fix this issue but again I'm putting in a couple data points and clicking on a few circles and I know a heck of a lot about my customers experience and what the sources of those those problems might be with really only five or ten minutes of research here there's all kinds of powerful things you can do with this data at your fingertips now let's go back and filter by signal strength so like I talked about earlier there's things that you can influence and there's things that are kind of out of your control signal strength to a point you have some control over that again you can find better antennas you can reduce the cabling in between your router and the antenna you can do things to influence the signal string you can't put new towers up but you can optimize the the signal within whatever towers they have out there so here you can see there's several areas where the signal strength is hit our threshold of very poor so again this would be a good way to help communicate to your customer that maybe it's worth spending some money on getting a better antenna set up for their their device so again you've got lots of lots of data points that you can you can manipulate here to get the exact perspective that you're looking to bring to troubleshoot or try and explain different situations to your customers [Music] so that covers it for the land quality and cellular Maps [Music]"}

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "okay folks thanks for joining us this is a Travis Derek I'm a product manager here at Peplink and today we're gonna talk to you about the speed fusion cloud so as always pep Link's mission has been unbreakable connectivity and delivering that unbreakable connectivity anytime anywhere and so as the coronavirus has unfolded around the world that mission is more and more relevant than it ever has been before and so as we watch this all happen we realize you know there's a need for customers and and just people anywhere to get connected with this unbreakable connectivity and there's a better way to do it Peplink has been doing this for a long time but it's always been there's been a little bit of setup required and so we'll talk to you today about how the speed fusion cloud addresses that but first I just want to talk to you about what the speed fusion clock does what what can this do for me or anybody trying to work remotely drink during these times so anybody who's used a cloud application knows internet is required and the quality of the internet connection will have a big impact on the amount of productivity you're able to achieve when using these cloud applications so Skype for business office 365 Microsoft teams Google Drive Google Docs Google meet all these different cloud applications are super popular and productive tools that everybody's been using and now everybody's trying to use those from home and so the network quality at your home isn't always the same as the network quality at your office and so when you're trying to do these things from home your connection at home just might not be that reliable or if you're like me you've got three kids who are at home and trying to do school from home and sometimes we just let net fix Netflix babysit them during our workday and so there's all kinds of constrains on the bandwidth at your home connection and so whether you're losing it all together or just the quality is getting degraded as all those different people at home are piling on again your productivity productivity suffers those applications start timeing out you get disconnected you get a sign back in all kinds of problems can happen now there's there's lots of solutions out there that allow you to connect multiple internet connections there's all kinds of LTE routers that have two modems in them and that's great that helps you get more band to it that helps you get a failover situation set up but what we find out is even with those failover routers if that second connection if one of those two connections goes down any traffic that was on that connection breaks and so the failover process goes step one something breaks your application fails and then step two you have to sign back in you have to call the person back you have to try and reconnect and the failover routers do a good job of making sure that when you go to reconnect it goes out the healthy connection and doesn't try to use the unhealthy connection so it it helps you it helps you find a healthy path again but it doesn't give you that unbreakable' experience again you drop off your webinar you run into all kinds of kind of embarrassing problems that you probably wouldn't have happened when you're in your office and so that's what speed fusion is here to solve speed fusion once you bring two different internet connections in together and make them active one seamless connection so even if one of those Apple even if one of those internet connections breaks even if it's in the middle of a phone call even if it's in the middle of a Skype conference you don't experience that connection break it seamlessly hands-off in the background and that's what speed fusions packet level su and technology does that no other LTE router manufacturers can do so speed fuse has four basic benefits to it or four different modes that you can you can use to protect your traffic you've got bandwidth bonding this is what a lot of people end up talking about because it's extremely unique that's being able to take two or more connections and make all of that bandwidth available to one single application that you're using when smoothing is used to protect phone calls or video traffic so this is for those those types of applications that you can't have jitter or packet loss interrupting you on so when smoothing is a great way to guarantee you've got a high quality connection for your your audio and video conferences and then hot failover is that seamless handoff between your internet connections so if if you're using a cable or DSL modem as your primary and that goes down for some reason hot failover is what's going to let you switch over to that LTE without breaking that call without breaking that video stream and pet VPN is the secure wrapper that makes all of these different technologies possible so we've talked about speed fusion and how it can help benefit you and protect your applications but what we're here to talk about is speed fusion cloud so speed fusion cloud is a new service at Peplink launched just a couple of weeks ago as a response to all of the people trying to work from home as they try and avoid coronavirus so historically speed fusion required a two box solution we'll say you had to have a remote box say at your house or maybe at a medical facility out in the field and then you had to have some sort of a headquarters device and so here we've got a balanced 20x out of the remote side number one and then we've got an EP X at our at our company datacenter number two so to make speed fusion work and to get the benefits of it previously you had to have these two boxes to make it work or any two boxes now the other option for number two could be you could use our fusion hub and put that in a cloud platform so you could put a fusion hub in AWS or Google Cloud or Azure instead of having to physical boxes you could have one box and one virtual machine to make speed fusion work but again this requires expertise this requires time this require setup and so it's a great solution but it's not great for everybody and it's not great when you're trying to roll something brand new out at the last minute to hundreds of people so sweet fusion cloudy aims to solve that problem make it even simpler so what Peplink has done is we've built a global network of speed fusion nodes and different data centers and different cloud providers all over the world so that there's access points to the speed fusion cloud in any region that you need to get connected in and so we're hosting that second box if you will we're making that cloud side infrastructure available to anybody who wants to get unbreakable connectivity anywhere they want so whether you're one person just trying to solve your own problems or you're a company of a few hundred people trying to get all of your workforce working productively at home all you need to do is get them a Peplink router at their homes and get connected to the speed fusion cloud so that they can protect all that traffic seamlessly and so what we've done is we've launched this service early this is supposed to launch in the fall but again what time better than now to get people connected and help protect all their applications and so we're offering this free for 90 days for anybody who wants to use this right now so we're gonna dive into a router and I'm going to walk you through the setup of it and show you how to how to get started and then show you how to actually protect different applications or devices that you want to you want to ensure the best connectivity for so there's six basic steps that we have to walk through here step one we just have to be on the right firmware so I'm gonna jump over to our forum and just show you guys where you can access all these resources here so if you go to form a point comm you're gonna see two topics that are pinned at the top we've got this quarantine response safeguarding your connectivity and then we've got firmware release for speed fusion cloud these are kind of your landing points for all the information that you're gonna need to get connected to the speed fusion cloud so first thing we need to do is we need to get the right firmware for our device so if we click on that you can see we've got all the firmware builds for all the different devices needed so I'm going to just click on download and then for today's demo I'm going to be using my P DX the P DX is a rapid deploy units soon to be launched so the P DX is a four modem device in a ruggedized Pelican case so that you can bring this thing anywhere you need the best connectivity possible at the push of a button so you can just boot this up and you're gonna have all the connectivity you need anywhere anywhere you go so to apply the firmware you need you can download the link that I just showed you or you can just push it there pre-loaded and in control as well so if we go to the device and we're at the device level here if we go to settings and go to firmware management okay so you can see I've actually loaded this firmware already it shows existing firmware 80.2 in this s zero eight nine this is the firm this indicates the firmware needed for speed fusion cloud but pretend we haven't loaded that yet if you look in this drop down here you can select that firmware right from the list I typically choose to push firmware immediately but you can also push it on the scheduled basis if you're in production hours at that time you can you can schedule that however you choose to do that either way click Save again I've already pushed this firmware out so I'm not going to reprovision that here the other way to do that is from the router directly if you go under the system tab and you go to firm where you can just choose to upload that file that we just downloaded and then you click manual upgrade again I've pre-loaded the firmware so we don't have to wait for the the router to take that an upgrade but again that covers step one so step two we have to register the serial number of the device so that we can get access to the speed fusion cloud so if we click on the about speed fusion cloud link or if we go back here this quarantine response both lead to the same forum post and this is basically the instructions laid out in great detail here so getting the special firmware we just covered that one now enabling free speech speed fusion cloud access if you click on that link it's going to take you to the enrollment page so it's pretty simple you just enter your email address and enter your device serial number verify that you are in fact not a robot and this is going to air out because I've already registered this device but had I not it's going to say cool you're good and then it's gonna email you the key so here you can see you're gonna get an email from no - 4-ply at Peplink comm it's going to have your activation Keys listed in there so once you've got your key then you can go back to your device if you go to the system tab feature add-ons section now if you if you wait a little while in control will push this key out to you automatically but if you're impatient like me you can just come in and activate that again this is gonna air out because I've already done this step but you should get a notice that says infusion client 100 gigabyte place it's activated so once you do that we've gotten through step 3 we've gotten through step 4 now I have to go to step 5 and enable speed fusion cloud on the web interface so if we go back to the dashboard we're gonna just take a quick look and we don't see any obvious signs of speed fusion clouds showing up here it looks just like the dashboard normally does so if we come into the Advanced tab on a max router the first thing you'd get brought to is the speed fusion page and so here we haven't set up the local ID I'm just gonna click Save it's Auto populated and when I do that it looks normal except there's this new section that you normally don't see that's speed fusion cloud so by default it says no speed fusion cloud is defined now before the speed fusion cloud you would come in here and you'd click new profile and you enter in all the technical details you need to get that tunnel set up to whatever box or or cloud appliance you're sending traffic to but the speed fusion cloud it's all pretty much done for you if I click on edit everything's set up there's a little bit of customization you can choose to do if you want but you don't have to do anything other than click Save so now that I've clicked save it says speed fusion cloud is enabled so I'm going to apply those changes and it's going to bring us to back to the dashboard and we'll see what happens so you can see on the dashboard now we've got this speed fusion cloud section here and you can see it's going to start building the tunnels we've got two tunnels by default we've got our default tunnel which gives you speed fusion bonding and hot failover and then we've also got a speed fusion cloud lan smoothing tunnel which again helps you protect voice traffic and things like that just below you're gonna see your data usage allowance and so you can see I've got a hundred gigabytes available to me and my expiration date is July 7th 2020 so I've got a default tunnel up the wind smoothing tunnels coming up as well so we've done step one through five now in just over ten or twelve minutes not too bad now the last step we need to do is steer traffic to the speed fusion cloud so setting setting all this up doesn't necessarily start protecting your traffic until you tell the router what traffic to protect so to do that we have just set out bomb policies so if we come to advanced then you click on album policy now we can actually start to carve out traffic or devices that we want to protect through the speed fusion cloud so we're going to click on add a rule before we do that actually let me just take a look at the client list I'll show you I'll show you what we're going to do here if we go to a status and then client list we've got this IP phone here on the network so this is we're gonna copy the IP address of this IP phone so let's say this is a remote worker of yours you're sending a voice over IP phone with your remote employees so that they can take calls and talk to customers from their home and again voice over IP is one of those finicky applications where available bandwidth or quality a bandwidth that your home just might not be enough to make the voice quality consistently good so you don't want your your users at home having kind of unprofessional garbled voice calls you want to make sure that they've got a good a good voice experience when they're when they're using that phone you also don't want to protect that that person's children's Netflix traffic right you don't you don't want to send all of that traffic to the speed fusion cloud you want to just make sure that you're protecting the things that matter to the work side of what your people are doing at home so if I go back to the outbound policy section we're gonna create a rule to protect that phone's traffic so I click on add a rule I'm just gonna call this IP Phone so we took the IP address of that phone so I'm gonna enter that in as the source so anything coming from this phone I'm telling this this rule to protect it and I don't care where that phone is talking to so I like to use the priority algorithm because it's very flexible and so what we're gonna do here is you can see on the right there's these two speed fusion cloud tunnels that are not in use right now I'm gonna drag those over to the top of the list so what I've done is I'm dragged I've dragged over the speed fusion cloud wind smoothing profile first because again that's a great way to protect voice traffic if that when smoothing tunnel isn't available for some reason then it's gonna go down to the next item on the list and that's the speed fusion cloud default tunnel so that's going to give me the bonding and hot failover still definitely better than not protecting the traffic at all when smooth things I deal but if that's not available again we can switch back to at least give it that hot failover now if the speed Asian cloud is unavailable completely priority lets me just move on down the list to use whatever internet connection might might be there so we've got some fallback plans if speed fusion cloud for whatever reason isn't there I like to use this terminate sessions on link recovery that's basically your fallback so if we start out and when smoothing isn't available but five minutes later we we find that that that profile is connected checking that terminate sessions on link recovery box is going to move steer that traffic back to the higher priority connection when it becomes available instead of leaving it at wherever wherever it got set up so I'm gonna click Save okay so we can say we've got the IP Phone rule here and I'm going to apply those changes so now we can see we've got both tunnels up everything looks happy we've got green lights everywhere I'm gonna come back to the speed fusion the Status page and we'll look at speed fusion and so here you can see the was two different speed fusion profiles and get all the nitty-gritty technical details about them so you can see the latency of each of my cellular connections to the speed fusion cloud you can see if there's any packet loss and right now you can see there's really no traffic going through and you either of those connections the other thing we can look at here if we go to status and active sessions we can see there's no active traffic happening right now so we're gonna boot up that phone and just see what it does so I've just powered up I've just reset that phone so that we can get that connected and have it follow that speed fusion cloud rule that we created so while we're waiting for that I'm just gonna go through some of the questions here and see if we can address any any quick questions and then once we get done with the demo I'll keep going on the questions and you guys can ask as many questions as you need you so I think the biggest question that I see so far is just people are looking for a list of the data center locations I know there's at least two nodes on in North America Europe Asia I don't think there's an Africa node yet but you know specific to the US there's an East Coast and a West Coast and in each data center location we've got multiple instances so I think there's four or five fusion hubs in each of those instances and the speed fusion cloud the cool thing about it is it auto scales so as we get more and more users more and more traffic new nodes will pop up in those data center locations and so it makes it really easy for for you as an administrator because you don't have to do all that load balancing in the background you don't have to scale the infrastructure and you don't have to tell the devices where to go as they connect to the speed fusion cloud they automatically identify the closest nodes to them and select those so that again it takes all of that management overhead out of your hands okay so I've got my phone online if we look at the active sessions table we should see we've got this is my phone again 192 168 50 10 you can see it's got two sessions right now going through that when smoothing profile that we that we told it to so it we're just validating that the device that we've chosen to protect is actually being protected so that all looks great so we're gonna come back to the speed fusion page the speed fusion status page I'm gonna make a quick phone call so here you can see we've got that speed fusion Cloudland smoothing profile and you can see there's active traffic going through there so when smoothing again it duplicates those voice packets across all your connections so you can see that phone call is using each one of these connections if we look at a graph I think that's a really helpful way too sorry folks I paused the share will go back to that screen so here we're going to restart this phone call you so here you can see there's traffic going across all of the different internet connections again that's what when smoothies purpose is is it's meant to duplicate all your traffic so that it goes across everyone in case one of those fails or has an issue now again if we look at the graph I think this is a really good way to visualize it so you can see there's different colors there's a lot going on here because we've got four internet connections active and the PDX has all kinds of available connections but you can see the the stacked colors here on the graph and so that represents the duplicated traffic so you've got the call going out all for Cellular is at once and you can see some of the graphs some of the colors are have some spikes on them and some of them don't and so that's what--when smoothing does is it fills in those gaps as one connection has a little pick up or a skip it it sends those duplicate packets out so that the other connection can pick up the slack for it so again this is the best way to guarantee you've got absolutely smooth calls when you when you're doing both voice over IP over over unreliable connections so I just hung up that call and now you can see the graph is tapered off the traffic is stopped going through there again on the on the table view again you see there's really no traffic going through the speed fusion cloud again and if we come back to the dashboard you can see we use just tiny little bit of bandwidth our 100 gigabytes of free usages drop down to ninety-nine point nine nine so you get a pretty real-time view of how much traffic you've used there on that on that dashboard panel so that's six steps to get up and running on the speed fusion cloud and get something protected there's lots of ways you can do those up on policy rules there's plenty of documentation on how to use outbound policies but if you're not sure you're not comfortable with it talk to your your favorite Peplink partner they'll get you guided in the right direction on that now the last thing we want to talk about is this is free for 90 days but what happens after that so here's a here's a table to illustrate what the pricing is gonna look like for this once once the free trial period is up so right at the top you can see we've got the speed fusion cloud free plan and it's a hundred gigabytes of usage at 50 megabits per second and that's good for three months for free so the important things to note here on this is the usage and the speed is per device so if I've got a hundred gigabytes to use over three months at 50 megabits per second if I get ten devices on there each of them are gonna get a hundred gigs and each of them are gonna be able to push at 50 Meg's per second just not a shared plan so you don't have to worry about maxing out that 50 Meg's per second now one device could max that out sure but again if you're doing multiple devices those aren't gonna all eat at the same 50 Meg's per second they're each gonna get their own 50 Meg's per second now once that free data trial is up there's some very affordable plans that you can purchase here to keep that keep that service going so we've got 200 gigs 500 gigs a terabyte and two and a half terabytes and you can see you can use these data buckets over different lengths of time so the smaller ones are three months then we move up to six months and then we've got a one-year plan for that two and a half terabytes so for pretty minimal investment you can get that hosted speed fusion cloud that global the structure taken care of for you so that you don't have to worry and manage all of that you can just deploy your devices and protect the traffic that you need and keep your users productive so with that I'm just go down the question list and start addressing those one by one I'll let you guys continue to pile them on I'm happy to stay and answer as many questions as we can as we can cover just a second while I load all these questions up you okay so it just showed all of the pricing info and people are of course asking about pricing for other regions prices for Europe I not exactly sure what the Europe pricing is I would reach out to your Peplink Account Manager but I would expect it's going to be very very close in euros to what the dollar value listed there is but again reach out to your your Peplink partner so see a question does speed fusion cloud if say for example you're using this on a yacht do you have to have a GPS antenna up at all at all times for this to work no you don't it's not based on the physical location of the device we just determined the shortest latency path to a speed fusion cloud node and so again GPS is not required to make this work we'll find the closest node in terms of latency not geographically necessarily I see a question about it fusion cloud-enabled in South America I don't believe the South America nodes are up yet but definitely I would open a support ticket and ask for that just put in a go-to ticket or support ticket dump Epling calm and open a support ticket asking for that we're able to add new nodes pretty quickly so get those requests in if you've got a location that you need you need to make sure that there's a local node nearby see another question about where the fusion hubs hosted AWS Google Cloud so we pick a we've got a variety of cloud providers and so we're not stuck on one cloud or the other and so that will vary region to region whoever has the the most reliable and cost-effective platform in those regions will will use multiple providers and as the service grows we will add more and more providers in each region as well and so this can get more interesting as you start trying to protect say as your traffic if you if you've got an office 365 application or something like that we'll be able to add more nodes so that that traffic gets steered to an azure node instead of an AWS node or something like that so you'll definitely see more functionality added to the system as as we grow again we launched this early to get this capability in people's hands right away and so originally this was slated to come out this fall and so again we'll add more features as as this ramps up another questions how can I choose the location right now that's not an option it automatically determines which location it's going to connect to in terms of the the speed fusion cloud node but that is another feature on the roadmap is giving you some more visibility and control as to what what knows you might want traffic to show up at you another question does the 90 days start when the customer starts using it or is there a deadline when it ends for everybody so right now that 90 days is based on when you drop that serial number into that registration page that's when you're your 90 day window starts I expect it sometime in the distant future here we will we will close down this free offer so at some point the offer won't be available anymore to people but again it starts whenever you don't dump your cereal into that registration form so one question other question I see is will there be any bandwidth limitations on the cloud and is it possible for the cloud links to get congested so there are bandwidth limitations I think that question came in before I showed the table but again you saw there the 50 or the hundred Meg's per second per device limit there and in terms of congestion again that's something we're monitoring so as nodes get congested we will Auto provision new nodes in those regions so that we can better distribute the load and as it's happening so again the speed fusion cloud the really cool thing is at Auto scales so that you don't have to manage that side yourself another question can speed fusion work over an Ethernet LAN absolutely that's one of the best parts about speed fusion as it works over anyone you want and so I'm gonna just pop into one of these profiles to show you how you can manage that so in my example I've got four cellular connections you can see when one and two up here are not being used but let's pretend they are so if we come to the advanced side and we see the speed fusion cloud here is enabled I'm just gonna click Edit what you could do let's let's say you have two two wired Internet connections or maybe even just one wired internet connection you can set that at Priority One and then you can set your Cellular's all at priority 2 and this is customizable per profile so for when smoothing it's usually best to use them all at the same time again these are choices you can make on your own and you can play with in practice but by default here we're saying let's send all of the speed fusion cloud traffic out these two Ethernet LAN connections if they're not available then let's send them out these for cellular connections so that way you can protect your cellular usage so if you've got wired connections that should be reliable enough should be quality enough to protect your applications then you can just prefer to send traffic that way again maybe that's an Ethernet LAN so that's how you can kind of manage your data usage on those cellular connections while using different LAN connection types another question is the free ninety days work does that work on devices that are out of warranty yes we are letting anybody who has a device that's in warranty out of warranty you're able to use speed fusion cloud for these free 90 days so go ahead and get it going you just won't have in control access to do the provisioning of the license key and those things you'll still have to log into your router locally to get that set up but again out of warranty devices are eligible for the 90 day free trial so another question I see here is clarifying as this is a service available only for Internet traffic or is there a way to build a corporate network based on the speed fusion cloud let's say you've got a hundred retail sites so yes and no it's generally it's it's for internet bound traffic one thing you could do so you're not gonna be able to build a private network like you would with speed fusion normally in general speed fusion cloud right now is it at the first launch here is internet only so you wouldn't be able to do like private addressing and do all that with the speed fusion cloud if you had a customer who has existing IPSec firewalls that would be something you could do you could route those firewalls through a speed fusion cloud connection and protect that IPSec traffic similar to how we protected the phone traffic so that's one way you could take an existing network and protect that with speed fusion cloud but still preserve that private network aspect of it but again it won't work like like the speed like the privately self-hosted speed fusion that you're used to where you can build a completely private speed fusion network another question the public IP address shared or dedicated it is a shared IP there's no inbound services it's purely for outbound protecting outbound traffic to the cloud you are there any restrictions on the device models no you can get this on any any Peplink router Peplink pep wave router is the data usage by device yes the data plans and the usage you see on the dashboard right now are tied to that unique serial numbers usage you you you say another question how do you how do you protect that privacy in people's people's information is preserved so by default these anybody connected to the speed fusion cloud you're not allowed to connect peer-to-peer we've specifically blocked that so you can't talk to another speed fusion cloud known user and so it's just like your your your home internet connection all of that traffic is getting funneled to the head end of the ISP at your home in the speed fusion cloud all that traffic is getting funneled to those cloud notes and then exiting to the Internet so each session is independent of each other there's no way to intercept those there's no way to snoop on other people's traffic it's completely a one-to-one path from you out to the speed fusion cloud and then the Internet you another question is if we're a fusion hub on AWS can this run in parallel with that what are the differences so yes you can run this in conjunction with existing speed fusion tunnels so if you've got for example a private network using speed fusion already in place you can still use that with and then add the speed fusion cloud so that you could route Internet bound traffic through the speed fusion cloud and then you can keep your private traffic on those existing tunnels so that's definitely a compatible scenario they are able to coexist with existing speed fusion tunnels so one clarification on the pricing that table that I show it will pull that back up here the pricing people are asking number one that's a per device price and number two the period that it's good for is listed here the other period that it's good for is the omona usage so if you use two and a half terabytes in six months that plan has been expired if you use one terabyte over eleven months that's still active for that last month and that's a per device license so you you pay for the you pay for the license so if we buy that $79 $79 license you pay that once and you get it for up to a year or two and a half terabytes whichever whichever exhausts first that's not a monthly price that's just a one-time price for the duration of either that term or the the bandwidth usage you I see another question about choose which region the traffic is sent to and right now that's completely automatic again we check based on the latency of between that router and all of the speed fusion cloud nodes and we pick the shortest path latency wise and in the future we will open up some way to control make me make me more manually if you want to prefer a certain region another question if I finish that plan up in a month can I purchase another one absolutely you can you can top off those data plans as much as often as you need to so if you use up your one-year plan in a month you can go buy another one so there's no you know you don't need to wait for another one another question asking about compatibility with older hardware revisions that don't support new firmware at this time I don't think we're going to add confusion cloud support to the old end-of-life hardware platforms that don't support the latest firmware that's something you could definitely open up a support ticket for if if you've got a unique situation where you think that's that's needed but I don't believe that's on the roadmap right now you you another good question here for example if I've got a balanced one do I need to load a speed fusion license on the device and able to use the speed fusion cloud the short answer is no that that's one nice thing the speed fusion cloud if you're using a lower-end device that doesn't have that native speed fusion capability this will activate that automatically only for the speed fusion cloud so you'd get the speed fusion bonding capability to the speed fusion cloud even if your device doesn't have a speed fusion license on it so that's one nice way to simplify things and keep it affordable for people as well you I see a question about whether or not it's available Canada the nodes I know in North America right now our East Coast in Virginia and West Coast in California so it's definitely available but your traffic would be going to the US and back so if there's a specific need or limitation where that's not acceptable again a support ticket would be the best way to handle that and I know there's platforms we use and have nodes in Canada so and I know you're not the first person to ask about Canada so those are definitely aspects of the service that we'll be updating and enhancing as those requests come in you another question I think it's a it's a question but I think it's very valid to talk about here question is the service required does the service require two internet connections to be useful and the short answer is basically yes speed fusion on its own isn't that useful with one internet connection it's that failover or that bonding capability that makes speed fusion unique and advantageous and so like with a br one many if you're if you've got a hundred people that you just sent home to work from home they've all got their own internet connections already right chances are they've got a DSL or a cable or some sort of broadband connection at their home so you can use that as the foundation and then if you send them with a br one mini you put a sim card in there and then they've got that cellular connection as the backup and so that's how you would achieve a two connection set up for somebody with a simple device like the BR one mini but again it's the two internet connections that really makes P fusion the most valuable you you another question about single internet connection scenarios if you use when smoothing on a single internet connection how does that work so you could use when smoothing on a single internet connection but again you're not going to get the best benefits of it you would basically be sending two copies of the same traffic over the same internet connection which might help a little bit if you've got some kind of short term packet loss but unlikely to provide the benefit you're really hoping for two internet connections again is the best way to do that and with the outbound policies you can help reduce your load on like a cellular connection so again in the example I outlined only that phones traffic would be going over those cellular connections by default everything else would just write over the the native connections instead of using speed fusion clouds so that's one way to protect how much data you use on that second internet connection if that's a concern you much thanks Stephen the sentiment back at you another question if the data usage is depleted before the period of the skew so basically it's just gonna stop rounding traffic that way and so that's where those priority rules are important some people like to use the enforced rules so if you use a rule that's enforced that means your traffic can only use that one path so I'll just show that quick I think that's a good one to illustrate look at this IP phone rule again you can say we've chosen priority and then a give priority gives you all of these options to exhaust if you choose enforced you get to choose one and so if I choose one and that's not available my traffic goes in nowhere so in force can be kind of a dangerous rule it's simple it's easy to configure and it's very straightforward but again it can be dangerous if that that interface that you've told it to go to doesn't doesn't work for some reason so again that's you know if you're if you're running out of your data bucket that would be a great reason to do the priority rule instead of an enforced rule so that if that tunnel does go down then you can failover to your normal internet connections and continue on without the speed fuse and cloud protection another question we've been getting a lot from is how can I buy this you can buy it on our website but you can more importantly you can buy it from your Peplink partners this is something that Peplink partners are going to be able to sell and it's something that will be sellable just like any other Peplink product or license that that's available today so everybody will be able to participate and end-users can buy it from the partners that they they know and trust and that already are familiar with their needs and their networks and so it's not good we're not going to redraw the lines in terms of how we how we sell the speed fusion cloud versus our other warranty or subscription plans that's it will follow a very similar pricing model to those and again resellers and distributors you can reach out to your account manager to get the details on what those pricing structures look like see another question that relates back to those when priorities is it recommended to keep all of your when connections around the same latency bad idea to add a satellite connection into the mix generally speaking I would group lands within the speed fusion profile based on their technology type so I would keep wired connections in the same group versus satellite connections versus LTE connections they try to bond to very different latency connections you're gonna get poor results now the speed fusion cloud automatically provision some settings to work around that so you're not going to dig yourself into a deep hole but you're also not going to get all the benefits you would if you structured the links a little bit better again this only applies if you've got cellular connections mixed with satellite connections or mixed with landline connections when you start trying to mix different technology types you'll want to kind of order those in priority instead of all in the same priority okay folks that pretty much we've pretty much ran out of time here we're at one o'clock thank you so much for joining if you've got more questions I would open a support ticket or talk to your account manager at Peplink or talk to your your reseller partner that you're used to buying Peplink from and we'll get those questions funneled up to the right people and answered again thanks so much for joining us"}

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "now the last step we need to do is steer traffic to the speed fusion cloud so setting the setting all this up doesn't necessarily start protecting your traffic until you tell the router what traffic to protect so to do that we have just set out bump policies so if we come to advanced then you click on album policy now we can actually start to carve out traffic or devices that we want to protect through the speed fusion cloud so we're going to click on add a rule before we do that actually let me just take a look at the client list I'll show you I'll show you what we're going to do here if we go to a status and then client list we've got this IP phone here on the network so this is we're gonna copy the IP address of this IP phone so let's say this is a remote worker of yours you're sending a voice over IP phone with your remote employees so that they can take calls and talk to customers from their home and again voice over IP is one of those finicky applications where available bandwidth or quality a bandwidth that your home just might not be enough to make the voice quality consistently good so you don't want your your users at home having kind of unprofessional garbled voice calls you want to make sure that they've got a good a good voice experience when they're when they're using that phone you also don't want to protect that that person's children's Netflix traffic right you don't you don't want to send all of that traffic to the speed fusion cloud you want to just make sure that you're protecting the things that matter to the work side of what your people are doing at home so if we go back to the album policy section we're gonna create a rule to protect that phones traffic so I click on add a rule I'm just gonna call this IP phone so we took the IP address of that phone so I'm gonna enter that in as the source so anything coming from this phone I'm telling this this rule to protect it and I don't care where that phone is talking to and so I like to use the priority algorithm because it's very flexible and so what we're gonna do here is you can see on the right there's these two speed fusion cloud tunnels that are not in use right now I'm gonna drag those over to the top of the list so what I've done is I'm dragged I've dragged over the speed fusion cloud wind smoothing profile first because again that's a great way to protect voice traffic if that wind smoothing tunnel isn't available for some reason then it's gonna go down to the next item on the list and that's the speed fusion cloud default tunnel so that's going to give me the bonding and hot failover still definitely better than not protecting the traffic at all when smoothing is ideal but if that's not available again we can switch back to at least give it that hot failover now if the speed Asian cloud is unavailable completely priority lets me just move on down the list to use whatever internet connection might might be there so we've got some fallback plans if speed fusion cloud for whatever reason isn't there I like to use this terminate sessions on link recovery that's basically your fallback so if we start out and when smoothing isn't available but five minutes later we we find that that that profile is connected checking that terminate sessions on link recovery box is going to move steer that traffic back to the higher priority connection when it becomes available instead of leaving it at wherever wherever it got set up so I'm gonna click Save okay so we can say we've got the IP Phone rule here and I'm going to apply those changes so now we can see we've got both tunnels up everything looks happy we've got green lights everywhere I'm gonna come back to the speed fusion the Status page and we'll look at speed fusion and so here you can see the was two different speed fusion profiles and get all the nitty-gritty technical details about them so you can see the latency of each of my cellular connections to the speed fusion cloud you can see if there's any packet loss and right now you can see there's really no traffic going through and you either of those connections the other thing we can look at here if we go to status and active sessions we can see there's no active traffic happening right now so we're going to boot up that phone and just see what it does so I've just powered up I've just reset that phone so that we can get that connected and have it follow that speed fusion cloud rule that we created okay so I've got my phone online if we look at the active sessions table we should see we've got this is my phone again one nine two one six eight fifty ten you can see it's got two sessions right now going through that when smoothing profile that we that we told it to so it we're just validating that the device that we've chosen to protect is actually being protected so that all looks great so we're going to come back to the speed fusion page the speed fusion status page I'm going to make a quick phone call so here you can see this going across all of the different internet connections again that's what--when smoothies purpose is is it's meant to duplicate all your traffic so that it goes across everyone in case one of those fails or has an issue now again if we look at the graph I think this is a really good way to visualize it so you can see there's different colors there's a lot going on here because we've got four internet connections active and the PDX has all kinds of available connections but you can see the the stacked colors here on the graph and so that represents the duplicated traffic so you've got the call going out all for Cellular is at once and you can see some of the graphs some of the colors are have some spikes on them and some of them don't and so that's what--when smoothing does is it it fills in those gaps as one connection has a little hiccup or a skip it it sends those duplicate packets out so that the other connection can pick up the slack for it so again this is the best way to guarantee you've got absolutely smooth calls when you when you're doing both voice over IP over over unreliable connections so I just hung up that call and now you can see the graph is tapered off the traffic is stopped going through there again on the on the table view again you see there's really no traffic going through the speed fusion cloud again you and if we come back to the dashboard you can see we use just a tiny little bit of bandwidth our 100 gigabytes of free usage is dropped down to 99.99 so you get a pretty real-time view of how much traffic you used there on that on that dashboard panel you you [Music]"}

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "the first the first reporting feature that we're gonna dig into is called our SIM card reports and the SIM card reports are visible at two different layers they're visible at the organization level and they're visible at the group level we'll start out at the organization level if you look at the top here you can see reports again we're at the organization level at this level there's only one report to choose that's our SIM card reports so we'll open that up now when you look at add here there's a couple different sections right up at the top there's a table of all the different carriers so we auto detect every router that you have in this organization we read the SIM card IDs and we automatically associate those to the the respective carriers so we automatically populate this table based on the SIM cards you have in your router so you don't have to do anything to get this table to show up the only thing you have to do is you have to configure billing start dates so the SIM card reports help you keep track of usage across your carriers across your SIM cards and then as a service provider it helps you keep track of your customers usage as well so at the at the organization level I like to think of this as the service provider level so if you're a service provider and you're buying data services from all these different carriers you're probably then going and offering your customers some sort of custom data plan that might include several different carriers or just custom bundles that they might not be able to buy on the market themselves so again at the organization level this is where I view this as kind of the cost perspective this is what you're paying the different carriers for and so if we look at AT&T I've not configured that one yet link them in here and we can say you know pretend we're paying AT&T for a hundred gigabytes per month bucket that's that's what we're subscribing to from AT&T and then we're gonna go and dole that out to different customers in different ways now if you've already started your month and you know you've transferred 10 gigs you can account for that and then you just need to choose whatever your billing start data is with carrier on that plan and so for simplicity I'm just going to choose the first of the month and then you can set up email notification so if you go it's your pool if your data plan that you're subscribing to from the carrier has some sort of a threshold where you start paying more or you start hitting overages or you start getting throttled you can account for that here and then you can alert your team down here as you see fit so you can choose whatever threshold you want to get alerts at and get those alerts automated so that you don't run into throttling issues or overage issues on your side [Music] okay so I've just saved them now next to each carrier here you're gonna get a little report graph icon as well so the all carriers that tracks every simcard every carrier just a rolled-up aggregate usage and then you can see down here we've got a nice report to chart that out so in February we used almost 20 gigs of data across all the SIM cards and so far in March we're picking up around almost 7 gigs of usage so far and so as you go over time as you use this feature this chart will continue to update once a month and again you can come down to the individual carriers and see specific to each carrier how much usage you've had on on each of those as well so you get really nice rolled-up aggregate reports so you can track trends and see how your utilization is trending between month to month and carrier to carrier the simple feature here in the middle of custom pools we'll talk about that at the group level I think that's more useful at that level so we'll skip that one for now and come back to that in a minute as we scroll down we've got person daily data usage so you can drop in any number of M's ease the IMSI number from your sim cards we'll just plop a few in there to populate this to report but you can take any SIM cards that you want to get a daily usage tracking for you can just drop those in here and get a nice clean CSV we'll just look for the week so far I'll download that open that up [Music] let that generate here so any any SIM card that you've got utilization on is gonna give you the exact kilobyte usage for each day that you've selected that there is actually usage therefore now not all of the mzs that I dropped in there are showing up and that's because those ones didn't have usage so only ones with usage will show up but if you've got a customer who's got some sort of question or confusion on you know where their utilization is coming from this is a nice way to just export all that data into one one clean table and find that now the last item down here the devices of SIM cards this is really useful for just keeping track of where your SIM cards are so here you can see we've got a device called the PD X F five six six and you can see all the SIM cards that are loaded into that device so every SIM card and every slot it's going to be reported back and listed out here so if you've got a thousand devices each with two SIM cards in there you can search you can search by MZ iccid mobile telephone number you can search by all sorts of criteria to find those SIM cards if you're looking to see where a particular one is or if you're just trying to inventory it you can download that CSV and have that all stored enough in a file so that you can reference that at any time you need lots of really useful functionality here at the organization level now if we dig into the group level I'll show you how you can use that perspective to shape the customer side of this so now we're in our customer ABC group and similarly we go up to the reports and we go down to the SIM card with reports so again we get that same table at the top that's automatically populated I haven't configured this at the group level yet so it's the same basic process here it's gonna auto populate the MCS as it sees each carrier and you can set those billing start dates at the customer level this might not be as as as useful because more than likely you're selling them some sort of customed to plan so the per carrier perspective may or may not be as important to that customer but regardless you can give them that visibility so that they can kind of see where their utilization is being sent to in terms of the different carriers but if we look at the simples this is where it gets really powerful for giving your customer a nice clean experience so you can give your customer data plans that span any carrier you want and so you can just drop in the mzs for the different SIM cards that you're giving so here I've got AT&T and Verizon SIM cards in this little custom bucket and I'm saying all of those sims have access to a bucket of 50 gigs per month and I'm gonna start billing my customer on the 1st of the month or whatever day you want to choose and then again you can get email notifications and so you could have a customer email address on this notification list so that they know when they're starting to approach an overage situation so that they're not surprised and you don't get that nasty phone call three weeks later when they get their very very expensive bill you can avoid that surprise and give them notifications as they tick up closer towards that that overs threshold and then you can give them a notification rate of 100% so that they know now they're in overage data territory so again this gives you a lot of different ways to track usage and overages on your side that you're paying for and then also track it and communicate with your customers on their side so that everybody's in the loop and you can notify different groups independently of each other now similarly at the group level you've got these same features that you saw before the person daily data usage and the device and SIM card listing out so depending on where you're trying to search again since in control two is multi tenant friendly you can give your customers access to this so they can come in and search their mzs their devices for specific SIM cards or whatever they're looking for but not not restrict yourself from doing that at the organization level so you you've got the ability to keep them out of other people's data but give them self-service access to their own information so that covers everything for the simcard reports [Music]"}

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "okay so Peplink just announced something really cool they're gonna be giving away the speed fusion cloud for free for 90 days and so I'm gonna show you how to get it set up the first thing you need to do is realize that you have to have a special firmware to operate the speed fusion cloud so if you don't have in control on your router you can down download the firmware and install it manually or if you have in control you can go to settings firmware choose the latest special build that's now published online click immediately and hit Save Changes if I go back to my HD for demo router here you'll see it's updating the firmware if you have seven point one or two or below you need to upgrade to seven point one two first before going to 8.0 so I'm actually upgrading to seven point one two and then I'm gonna go to eight point zero two if you have version six firmware you need to go to the latest six then the latest seven and then go to eight okay so now that the router is update to the latest firmware I can go ahead and go to the service enrollment and you do that by clicking on this link here it'll bring up the service role minute so you're gonna need your serial number and your email address so we've got the serial number the router I'm gonna put in my email address tell them I'm not a robot hit submit and then I should receive an email in just a few seconds with the information so I can go ahead and click go back to my router click settings remote web admin and I'm going to go to the system tab I'm gonna go to feature add-ons and I've already received my license key so I'm gonna go and just copy the license key and paste it into the system add-ons and hit activate so see right here span a speed fusion way an activation key license activated so I go back to I go to my Advanced tab go to speed fusion set my local ID and right there you'll see this new feature set up speed fusion and so I'm just gonna click on this go ahead and enable it hit save and click apply you'll see that it's creating the tunnels after I've clicked apply okay now that the speed fusion van is enabled in the speed fusion settings and I applied the changes the router is online and you can see it's set up right there now there are two tunnels that are created by default the default tunnel which is our standard speed fusion option and then they created another one called speed fusion LAN LAN smoothing when smoothing adds extra parity bits to ensure reliable voice and video operations now if you use main smoothing as an option it will use more data so if you're on cellular that's it's important to know if you're on like a cable modem with a backup cellular that's also important to know because once again you're gonna use more data but you're gonna have better voice and video especially over volatile connections like dsl or cellular so now that the speed fusion tunnels are created we're gonna go and program the router to use those tunnels so if we go to the Advanced Settings or network settings if you're using a balanced router that doesn't have a cellular go to your outbound policy and I can create an outbound policy that will allow my voice traffic to use the land smoothing option so I'm going to say avoid destination you can either put in the domain name which is like say the service provider of your SIP trunk or you could change it to if you don't know that and you instead would rather use the port's used for your phones that your phones use so you can either do by domain name and just put in your SIP trunk provider or do it by port so I'm going to go back to domain name because I liked that one a little bit better so I'm going to say if anything goes to next vortex comm and force or priority over when smoothing so I'm gonna choose when smoothing here so what that does is it'll say use the speed fusion way in smoothing option and then if that doesn't if that's not available for whatever reason failover to my normal internet connections and down here when you say window connections are available I like to say fall through the next rule just in case something you need that extra level of protection especially a voice traffic safe and then I'm gonna go ahead on my HTTP persistence I'm gonna do the same thing I'm gonna say so basically this HTH HTTP persistence rule it says hey if it's 443 maintain a session persistence so what we're gonna do is we're gonna say priority a speed fusion then failover to your internet connections and then on my default rule I'm gonna go to custom priority and oh sorry I don't want to win smoothing one I want to do the default style that's gonna use less bandwidth so any any of your voice traffic voice or video traffic that you want to do speed wind smoothing create a custom policy for that either the port or the destination and then for your other traffic you're just going to use speed fusion default hit apply changes and that's now your router is set up to use the speed fusion cloud thank you for watching my video and I hope this information is helpful to you just a little bit of a background for those of you don't know speed fusion does require two peers something to respond your traffic and then the device to be bonded or the device be connected with the new speed fusion cloud that is no longer the necessary case if you are a standalone user out in the field or you have a whole bunch of branch locations all over the world or country you can deploy them using the speed fusion cloud and they will connect to the closest local hop and then use the bonding to add to connect to your services so instead of needing a big deployment of speed fusion or fusion hub endpoints you can just use the speed fusion cloud to do that more information we coming later but this has been rushed enabled just for people that are working remote right now that might need reliable connectivity especially for voice and video operations have a great day"}

there's obviously a really enhanced need for mobile connectivity for medical facilities and so today i'm just going to show you some different solutions that Peplink has for mobile connectivity especially when we talk about deploying them rapidly as as we all need to do right now so ever since Peplink was started really the focus has been on unbreakable connectivity anytime anywhere and so obviously that message is even more relevant today as we try and get medical facilities up and running and ready for this this crisis that we're facing we'll show you a case study here a recent one out of prominent University in Hong Kong this client was an existing Peplink customer but in the response to Cove at 19 this university had to close all of their classrooms send all of their professors home and try and resume operations remotely and right away it became immediately apparent that the professor's internet connections just weren't good enough in a lot of cases to sustain a productive classroom setting doing a remote video instruction live over the Internet sounds great and it definitely makes this challenge easier but the problem is again it's all hinged on that last leg that that professors internet connection if that's not good none of the students are going to have a productive experience and so they were scrambling to try and find a way to make this remote presentation system work better so that it could be a productive tool for their their students to use so what they did is they took our new Peplink UBR and they deployed that to all their professors homes and so they've got landline and cellular connections at the professor's home so the UB honor is a two modem product it's got two different cellular radios in it and then you can also plug it into a landline LAN so you've basically got three different internet connections that you can use to protect your your traffic whatever is important to you and in this case those those remote video lectures so each professor was sent out a Peplink ubr they plugged it into their home broadband and then they used the dual cellular connections to augment that home broadband because again that home broadband just wasn't high enough quality to really sustain these videos so that that system tunneled all that traffic to the cloud all of that all of that remote lecture material got wrapped up with speed fusion so it was triple protected up to the cloud and then all the students were able to log in remotely using their own existing internet connections to view that video so let's take a big let's take a deeper look at the UBR LTE so again like I said there's two cellular connections in here you can see in ten of cores for cellular one cellular - it's got built-in Wi-Fi it's got that Ethernet LAN port and then forward Ethernet LAN port so you can get all kinds of devices phones computers cameras whatever you need plugged into this device it's got a ruggedized power connector but again the real magic here is speed fusion you've got two different cellular connections and one wired connection so that you can utilize all sorts of different connections to protect your traffic so you can do all sorts of traffic steering policies so that perhaps you're you're doing remote meetings over Skype you can tell the UPR okay I want to protect my Skype traffic using when smoothing when smoothing gives you that packet duplication so that you don't get any loss and video quality you don't get any gaps in your audio but let's say for your email you could send that over a hot failover just so that if one of your links suddenly goes down that email doesn't stop sending it just seamlessly switches over to a different link so again you can create custom outbound traffic steering policies to protect the traffic with the most appropriate speed fusion policy so here's another a study that we want to look at this is again a very recent case study in response to the Cova 19 outbreak so this was done using our partner West networks in Florida in the United States and a longtime customer of theirs Parkland Hospital in Texas reached out and said you know we're trying to scale up our mobile operation so that we can be ready and so we need to roll out several mobile clinics with the best possible internet connection and so West Networks jumped into action right away got out there on site and started installing a Peplink system to meet their needs so here's a diagram to kind of break down what they did for this mobile healthcare setup so at the hospital on the left you can see that that gray circle that's the hospital we've got internet connections coming into the hospital and I've got this whole existing stack of network routers switches firewalls and obviously in a hospital medical setting privacy and security is absolutely paramount and so that's the really cool thing is with Peplink vast array of integration features you're able to bolt on this this whole new overlay for this really robust mobile connectivity in a way that's really friendly to the existing network so there's lots of different ways you can implement and integrate a Peplink speed fusion setup into an existing network without having to kind of start over from scratch on the security side of it so on the right side that's the mobile side so we've got mobile clinics you can see there's a couple different mobile clinics here on the right and there's pop smaller pop-up clinics and so in each in each of these scenarios you've got four modem four modem two modem connections and you can home those all back to that SDX in the hospital so that each of them can use all the all the different internet connections they have out in the field to give you enhanced throughput and enhanced application performance all using the military level security of speed fusions VPN so this makes it super easy to scale up new sites you don't have to go and reach you the whole retool the whole network you can add more and more sites as the demands are needed so here's a here's an even closer look at how this is working at an individual site level so on the Left we've got the mobile clinic you can see there's four different LTE connections there we've got the Internet in the middle and then at the right we've got the hospital and so the unique thing about speed fusion is compared to other multi modem solutions out there is we're doing packet level SD when that's something again other multi modem products just don't have the capability to do and so what that gives you is it gives you unlimited number of paths that your traffic can take so that it's always got the best performance so again on the mobile side we've got for LTE connections on the hospital side you can see there's two fiber connections so what speed fusion is able to do is it's able to basically turn those connections into eight different paths that any single packet could take and so if you send it from the first LTE connection to the second fiber connection like you see the packet one there all of a sudden that path becomes a little less than optimal you've got basically seven other paths that you could send that traffic through and that's all dynamics sub-second automatically happening in the background nobody has to manage that nobody has to monitor that we make sure performance is going to work it going to be optimized all the time no matter what the situation on the ground is like so that fits into this Rapid Deployment e^x this is a modular enterprise-grade router oftentimes we see this put into data center sites but this is also a relevant model for for a remote site if you've got a high end remote asset mobile clinic mobile command center the SDX can fit in great there as well too but again oftentimes we see this on the data center side to kind of put all the speed fusion traffic back together with so the SDX has two different integrated SFP+ 10-gig LAN ports it's also got eight p OE lan ports and of course it includes speed fusion st LAN and are in control central management but it's also got this expansion slot on the right so that you can put whatever interfaces you need more of so there's three different basic categories of add-on modules you can get for this there's there's LTE module so you can get the latest for G technologies or 5g technologies and then there's Ethernet modules so you can get additional Ethernet ports if that's important to you or there's more fiber ports if that's what you need so you can customize this for wherever you're putting it so again if it's going into a mobile clinic you could add LTE interfaces that's going into a data center you could maybe add some more fiber interfaces another product that fits great into our rapid deploy solutions is the HD for mbx HD for mbx is a four cellular solution so it's got four built-in cellular radios on it but you can also plug a variety of other connections into it so there's three Ethernet LAN ports so if you've got like VSAT connections or the location you've driven up to has some sort of fixed line internet or maybe you've got a microwave point-to-point link or something like that you can plug all kinds of different internet connections into this in addition to those four built in LTE connections you've got Wi-Fi LAN and Wi-Fi LAN so again if there's a hotspot in your bunny you can hook up to that and then there's 8p o e LAN port so you can plug all kinds of cameras access points and any computing devices you need into this this router as well so if we look at the back of the router here you this is where you can see the LTE radios and the really cool thing here is this is a modular product as well so you can see that tray on the top clicks in so you can buy it with gigabit LTE connections today and tomorrow as 5g becomes more available you can swap that radio module out and upgrade the router to 5g without having to buy a whole new router the other cool thing about this is it's got the horsepower to handle 5g so it's two and a half gigs of throughput so as that 5g bandwidth becomes available again you can scale the the capacity of this router up without having to replace it next up in our rapidly deploy arsenal is our PD X and this thing is the epitome of rapid deploy so the PD X is a lot like the MB X that we just showed you it's got four built in LTE connections and it's got a lot of nice portability features it's completely integrated so it's it's in this nice ruggedized weatherproof case all of the antennas are built into the cover and then you've got this nice patch panel on the top and external ports on the outside so that you can map any of the POA enabled ports integrated into the unit to external port so you could run video cameras you could run any sort of Wi-Fi access point maybe IP phones you've got all sorts of connectivity options that you can map out using that patch panel on the top now it's also got three different bays there that you can see on the left that support either batteries or additional radios so again it's got four built in LTE radios but maybe there's a particular frequency or a particular network you want to get it on you can drop in a speed fusion engine into one of those ports or again you can drop batteries in there so each battery is going to give you about three hours of connectivity so you can drop three batteries in there and get you through a full workday without being plugged into anything now you've also got AC and DC power plugins on the outside of it so you can take any sort of power that's available to you or again switch over to battery if that's what you need to do but again this is the best possible solution for remote portable connectivity and it's a solution that we've already had used in the field for this code at 19 response one of our partners located in Europe had a very special request coming to them from the prime minister of their country they had the need to get some some mobile staging areas set up and they needed a rich enterprise video solution at those staging centers so that they could coordinate with other offices around the country and that that enterprise video solution they were using required layer 2 connectivity between the the remote site and the central codec and so what they were able to do is take this PDX and get that going on-site get a layer 2 speed fusion tunnel set up and drop an MB X in at the central site and literally overnight they were able to get this layer 2 connection up and running to a remote site out in the field and this is something the government did not think was possible and quite frankly it's not easy to do in most cases trying to get layer 2 connectivity over a bonded multi cellular solution is really only possible at Peplink and so they were able to deploy this overnight and the government was wowed they were just really impressed and of course really thankful that they were able to continue their their disaster operations on schedule so another solution that I'm going to show you now is something brand new this is something that we planned on pulling the curtains back on later this year but given the the urgent need for everybody to get rapid communications up and running we're deciding to launch this now and that's our speed fusion cloud so typically with speed fusion you need two routers or you need a router and a cloud appliance and so there's a little bit of integration required to make that all work and so what speed fusion cloud does is it takes that second piece of the puzzle out of your hands so that you don't have to do that integration all you need to do is get your remote sites a Peplink router and then there's a checkbox in the in the routers UI to connect to the speed fusion cloud check that box click Save now you've got that speed fusion connectivity out to a global network of speed fusion peers that we've already established in our monitoring and maintaining so that you've got a high quality cloud side network always available always on demand and we're gonna offer that free for the first 90 days so that anybody can get a speed fusion network up and running really really fast so if you check out this forum post you can see some details of that but again this is a really exciting solution that we just had to get out the door now to help get as many people connected and help people protect whatever applications are important to them responding to this crisis so with that I thank you for your time check us out Peplink com check out our social media profiles and if you've got more questions just shoot over a question to marketing at Peplink comm and we'll get you the answers you need to get whoever you need to get connected up and running thank you [Music]"}

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "okay folks let's get started thank you for waiting this is travis with Peplink and today we're going to talk to you about speed fusion and Peplink for broadcasting now speed fusion was relevant for all kinds of scenarios but broadcasting really highlights some of the unique capabilities of speed fusion and so we've gotten a pretty pretty intense following in that industry so we're going to talk about some case studies we'll talk about some hardware and we'll talk about specifically how speed fusion helps make Peplink a unique winner for broadcasting solutions so the key message the key focus of Peplink is delivering unbreakable connectivity anytime anywhere and so that's obviously super relevant for a broadcaster broadcasters never know where they might be next but they know they need to get there and they know they need to get the broadcast out immediately every time it needs to just work no matter where they're at and so that's exactly what Peplink is is designed to do we make broadcasts and all kinds of other things possible no matter where you are and so that it works every time the same way it did the last time so we'll start out with a case study we've got a radio station here they they're the largest radio station in Berlin Germany and every year they put on a large concert festival and so this is a picture from that festival and so they needed to upgrade their broadcast capabilities from this festival so this is RTL radio is the name of the radio station again they're based out of Berlin Germany and so they approached our partner vital who's based in Germany and Turkey and basically told them you know we've got this this broadcast coming up and in the summer of 2019 we really need to upgrade our capacity they had a lot of issues with IP based links having inconsistent performance and it was just really complicated to pre-plan for those types of events trying to make sure they had all the connectivity they needed so they really needed to just find a way to make it a lot simpler and a lot more reliable so the requirements were pretty straightforward they wanted the absolute best quality live-streaming possible they weren't willing to tolerate any sort of jitter or garble or packet loss that might impact that audio quality I need it to be flawless every time and latency was something they really zeroed and on that was something they knew had caused problems with previous attempts that they've done and so any network can perform great at one point in time but especially with LTE networks the more people that are on there the less likely you are to get a stable stable latency on that connection and so again you can see in the picture there are thousands and thousands of people there and so these are the times when the LTE networks really start to start to experience higher latency and higher packet loss and so you might be able to test out this set up great the day before the concert but when everybody shows up it suddenly doesn't work on that well so won't dive in and show you a diagram of the solution they deployed they used a variety of our products to stitch together a really nice seamless and flexible deployment so the first component they used is our balanced 380 so that's at their headquarters their main studio this is their brick and mortar facility or all their audio and broadcast equipment live and so they put a balanced 380 there to be kind of the speed fusion core of their network now out in the field at the concert they've got an HD 4 MB X that gives them for different LTE connections to utilize as well as any wired connections that might be available so that's the core of the mobile side of the network is that HD 4 MB X now being that there's thousands and thousands of people attending and thousands and thousands of people listening this is a must work type of scenario and so they wanted to make sure they had a second router there just in case something went wrong and so they chose to do an HD 2 as a backup router so if the 4 modem router for whatever reason wasn't working they could switch over to this HD 2 and still have at least 2 LTE connections to to keep things moving with and so they created a speed fusion tunnel from that remote kit the mbx to that core router to balance 380 and then they also utilized a fusion hub which is basically a cloud appliance that lets you take advantage of speed fusion technology to any cloud applications you might have and so they use that to connect to of their voice over IP system so they could broadcast live from the event back to their their studio and then out over the airwaves over their live radio network but they could also take calls live so they could have calls come in to their their voice system on on the cloud PBX and then they could route that call straight out to somebody at the concert and still maintain that flawless audio quality that they expected on their broadcast side as well so next up will show you a 1-over winner of our photo contest Peplink running a photo contest starting in 2019 or 2020 every month and so this is a picture from our january contest so again you can submit pictures any month you want we're gonna pick a winner every single month so please send those pictures in to us but again this is not a stock photo here this is this is the winner for January it looks like they're broadcasting from a beach probably a pretty darn good place to be right about now isolated out on a tropical beach doesn't sound too bad you can see maybe or maybe not you can see but I can see there's an HD 4 MB X at the top of that kit next to the table there you can see the Wi-Fi antennas sticking out of there a little bit so they've just got a simple box and a microphone in the headset and that's a fully functioning professional broadcast kit ready to go anywhere they need to go here's another photo from that January contest this is an audio mixer you can see next to our brand new Balance 20x and so the balance 20x is a single radio product out of the box but it's got that second slot so you can add a second radio in there so you can do all kinds of speed fusion strategies with that super affordable balanced 20x that you see in the picture there so I'm gonna break down some of the speed fusion technologies at Peplink has that uniquely make Peplink an ideal choice for broadcast technologies there's four different layers here that you can see we've got pet VPN on the very bottom we've got hot failover when smoothing and bandwidth bonding bonding so pet VPN is the core of it all that's at the very bottom there and what VPN does for a broadcast scenario is that's the super simple and reliable foundation of Peplink VPN technology so there's other VPNs out there but they're usually pretty complicated they usually require things like static IP SIM cards out at the edge they've got all these extra requirements to make them work and so a lot of the times those aren't that friendly with field type of deployments so pet VPN is just again that super flexible VPN core that makes remote broadcasting really simple and consistent so it comes up every time no matter whose SIM card you're using it's that reliability factor that makes it work every single time you take the box out and plug it in hot failover is a strategy you might not use for your primary broadcasting applications but when you're out in the field you've got all these other things you need to do on top of doing a broadcast so that could be just something as simple as sending an email there's all these applications that you've got that you want to run in parallel to the broadcast but you don't want them to consume precious bandwidth that the broadcast is using you don't want them to compete so you don't want to treat them the same that's that's really one of the beauties of Peplink technology is it's an agnostic platform so you can use it for your broadcasts applications and you can use it for any other internet applications all at once and you can create different policies for each application so that gets protected in the best way so you can use hot failover for your less critical application so that when you click send on an email that doesn't get interrupted if that link that it's riding on goes down and it also doesn't saturate all your links that you might be using for your broadcasting now if we go up to the top the orange the two orange squares here we've got when smoothing and bandwidth bonding will dive into those in a little more detail here because he really the bread and butter of the broadcast portion of our solution so first up we'll talk about speed fusion bandwidth bonding this is what a lot of people think about when they think of you know how speed fusion can work for a broadcast and so what bandwidth bonding does is it lets you take multiple internet connections could be you know in the US we've got a lot of LTE carriers that Verizon AT&T t-mobile Sprint you can smash all of those four carriers together and have one reliable pipe one fast pipe for any application that you need to increase the the speed rate for so sometimes when you're broadcasting out in the field it's not necessarily live you might be out broadcasting and you just gonna record that feed but it's still time-sensitive you need to get it back into headquarters for processing and other other people to review right away it's not something you can wait to drive all the way back and then do the processing with need to shoot it record it and then upload that video right away and so this is where speed fusion bandwidth bonding really plays a role speed fusion band with bonding lets you take one single file that you're uploading and spread that across all those active links there's lots of companies that make multi modem products they can make you can find other companies have to radio products or maybe even more but the thing they can't do is they can't chop up one file upload across all those different links it's gonna go on one link or another link and it might fail over to a different link but it's not going to be able to share the bandwidth across all those links for one single file upload so that's one really unique benefit that speed fusion brings with bandwidth bonding technology now if we look at when smoothing this is another speed fusion technology that is maybe more well-suited for actual live broadcasts so when it's moving is a technology that utilizes packet duplication technology and so if you've got multiple links again maybe you've got a verizon and AT&T link instead of sending that that can that that broadcast out one or the other you send it out both at the same time so every single packet of your transmission is duplicated and sent out every available length and so it's it's a very brute-force method to guarantee that your application is going to get the absolute best performance possible so by duplicating those packets and sending them out each link simultaneously you can automatically and seamlessly work around any latency spikes or packet loss spikes or any sort of interruption that one connection may experience there's already a packet identical packet on the other carrier that you've got ready to arrive to make sure that that stream doesn't get interrupted and so when smoothing is really the ideal technology for real-time voice and video transmissions this is for stuff that just has to work no matter what it's really ideal for maintaining a consistent bit rate so if you've got a 1 Meg target or a 5 Meg target on your stream land smoothing is the absolute best way to make sure that you're consistently staying at that at that speed throughput target so we'll look at a piece of hardware that some broadcasters have really latched on to here and that's our speed fusion engine so speed fusion engine is a tiny little box with two radios in it so it's really designed to be an integration type of device so you can take and bury this to Radio speed fusion router in all sorts of backpacks or mobile kits that you might want to put together to just make that rapid deploy aspect of broadcasting much more straightforward so again here you can see there's two different cellular connections there's a GPS connection and then there's SIM card slots and Ethernet port and another nice thing is it's got a micro USB connection so you can run this thing off of any battery bank that you might find off-the-shelf so you can get a great big battery bank and run your mobile broadcast kit right off of that so let's see really scale down the cost and the complexity of of what a broadcast kit might look like again it's very small highly ruggedized you can see that nice heavy heatsink on the top so it's going to be able to perform well in all kinds of different scenarios very very ruggedized ready to go for pretty much anywhere you want to go so here's a here's another case study that we'll look at and they actually utilize that speed fusion engine that we just saw this is a marathon in Thailand and so they've got a pretty rad broadcast setup here we've got some some dudes on motorbikes with some backpacks and then if we look at the other side we've got another dude with no helmet but he's got a camera shooting from the back so these guys are out on motorbikes riding all over this this marathon to get live streaming video from the met from the marathon to people all over the country and world so they can watch this as it happens so they needed obviously something very small right you've got two guys on motorbikes you don't have room for a whole satellite uplink kit right this is this is highly portable this is as about as portable as it gets when it comes to broadcasting so again you get several several folks on motorbikes there's a command center that they have staged near the finish line and on the motorbikes they've got a backpack that includes the speed fusion engine inside a video encoder and then that plugs into the camera that the person on the on the back of the motorbike is riding with and then they've got a battery in there as well of course so they're using two different LTE feeds on that speed fusion engine to connect back to an HD four in the command center and so the HD four has for LTE connections so they've got all kinds of diversity to make sure that each one of those streams are coming in smooth and then they're able to relay those streams from that command centre back out to other broadcast locations you so here's some pictures you can see in the backpack side on the Left you've got the battery you've got an encoder you've got a small camera there and then you've got the speed fusion engine with antennas kit about it all strapped down and then you can see at the head end you've got that HD four you've got some additional some encoder decoders there so again it's a pretty straightforward setup complicated technology but it doesn't have to be complicated to deploy it's all pretty straightforward to get this this packet level bonding and smoothing technology deployed for whatever broadcast you have now if we move up the ladder we've got something even more specifically tailored to the broadcast injured industry and that's called our speed fusion engine cam so this is a purpose built from the ground up product to integrate directly to modern IP based cameras so we worked with a professional camera manufacturer a global global leader in in broadcast camera technology to develop this product to meet their specific requirements and so this clicks right into the the gold mount or the V mount basically that the broadcast world is split between there's roughly 50% of both of those on the most professional broadcast cameras out there and so you can click this into the mount on the camera and then you can piggyback a battery right on on the back of this so that it's all clicked right into the camera and power all in one unit right on the right on a broadcasters shoulder so again this is highly integrated for the broadcast industry as compared to the speed fusion engine where you're doing some of the integration yourself or leveraging a partner to do some of that integration speed fusion engine makes it all just click and go type of experience so here you can see the speed fusion engine cam on a JVC professional IP camera again it just clicks right in there and the cool thing about speed fusion engine camera is you can plug your broadcast camera into it directly but if you have other broad camera people nearby with Wi-Fi capable cameras the speed fusion engine camera also has a Wi-Fi access so you can piggyback a couple other cameras off of that same unit if they're all in close proximity so again you've got just a ton of flexibility with this one unit so similar to what we saw in that in that motorbike marathon broadcast unit if you're using our speed fusion engine camera you get two different LTE connections so you get to combine the bandwidth using either bandwidth bonding or you can use when smoothing to combine those connections into something that's gonna protect your video applications and then you can upload that either to the cloud or to a physical data center where you've got a Peplink router or the Peplink fusion hub to work on that video and get it out to the masses from there here's a live demo we did at the NAB Show this fall you can see we've got a well dressed gentleman with the camera on his shoulder there using the speed fusion engine camera streaming live and then we've got the receiving end there also over cellular at the booth and so again this is a trade show right there's tons of people there cellular bandwidth is kind of crushed but we were able to broadcast live from an LTE connection to an LTE connection and deliver that studio-quality video experience so here's another product that we'll talk about for broadcast solutions that maybe scales up even further so this is our HD for mbx so this is a four radio or a quad cellular mobile router so this is something you can put in a broadcast vehicle you could put it in the backpack but it's fairly heavy it's not it's not the most portable but highly ruggedized for mobile environments so again this would be a great fit in in a broadcast vehicle again there's four radios the cool thing here is it's modular so as 5g rolling out right now we've got a tray that you can swap out so that you can click in the most current 5g radios as your carriers deploying those networks and it's got the horsepower to be ready for that it's two-and-a-half gigs of throughput so you've got plenty of bandwidth for those 5g connections as they roll out so here's a case study if somebody who deployed that for their own broadcast needs it's the US Ski Team so this is the US Ski Team the the Olympic team right these guys go all over the world competing every year even outside of Olympic years so they go all over and they've got all sorts of media events that they've got a host at or near their truck and so they needed a better broadcast solution from what they were using they just didn't really have a reliable setup that worked across the globe as they went all over the place and so they settled on the HD 4 MB X to provide that connectivity and the big deal was its future proof right they can deploy it today and then they can make a small investment later as wireless technologies improve to update those radio technologies to make it even faster the other really big deal again is these guys go all over the world so they needed that worldwide band and frequency support and so the HD for mbx is a global product you can use in just about every region in the world and it's gonna get you connected so poor thing they have to do if they go to a new continent is swap SIM cards they don't have to make any changes on the config they don't have to do anything crazy to make it all work just pop an old SIM card out add a new one in or if they have the SIM cards already they can populate those and automate all of those policies so that as they turn it up in a new geography it's automatically going to detect that which SIM card is the most appropriate to you so again it gives them tons of operational flexibility so they don't have to have IT staff tinkering with it every time they try to turn it on and make it work so here's the mbx they put that in there in their mobile wax truck they've got cellular connectivity from carriers around the globe they've also got the ability to use local Wi-Fi so if they're near some place it has its own internet connection they can augment their setup with that bandwidth as well then they aggregate all that using speed fusion and they send it to is this our speed fusion our fusion hub which is the cloud appliance so that they're able to just get that speed fusion bandwidth for all applications no matter where it lives so they send everything to that fusion hub and then from there it goes out to the Internet protected with high quality speed fusion backing it up so again here with the HD 4 MB X you've got four different LTE connections possible and then you've got three different wired connections you can plug it into whatever encoder you want to use and so again it's very flexible in that sense we're not forcing you to use this encoder or that encoder there's other multi modem products out there that are focused on broadcasters that kind of force you into their ecosystem you have to use their include encoder you have to use their cloud sometimes you even have to use their LTE data connections and so you end up spending tons of money a month on their solution and it's really locking you into their platform where Peplink just gives you a platform that you can use whatever video encoding solution you want and so it's a very agnostic and open ecosystem that we've created that's gonna work for any broadcast technology or non broadcast ancillary applications that you need to use in the field here's another case study from another customer here in the US this is w c YB TV these guys StormTracker vehicle has been kitted out with Peplink for a couple of years now so they've got a couple of these vehicles with ready to go setups mounted right to the roof here you can see there's all kinds of antennas up there lets them just roll out and go wherever there's crazy weather happening so that they can get out there fast and and deploy live right away without missing some sort of critical moment so here you can see that an HD for inside of the vehicle you can see the rear-view mirror there just slightly between the gap the air gap of the router and the cable management there so that's in the back of the vehicle and then they've got that plugged into a video encoder and then back at their studio they've got a larger router to take all those feeds back so they've got several vehicles with that mobile kit and then they've got one router at their core to bring all those feeds back so any vehicle can go out at any time and be ready to go then they've got that decoder there and then they can get it out to the internet and to their their traditional TV broadcast from there and again the beauty of this is it doesn't it's not limited to just video they can access the internet they can check scripts they can do all the other things that they need to do while they're out in the field through that one platform that they've deployed it's it's a really good investment giving them the ability to protect lots of applications instead of just being a video specific platform so here's another way you could do a mobile broadcast solution and that's with our HD to ip67 this is a fully ruggedized outdoor unit so it's got two cellular connections and it's an ip67 rated enclosure so it's gonna work just fine in any vehicle outdoor location you might want to put this on but you can put it outside where you're gonna get the best signal possible so you can put it up on a pole if you've got a boom on your vehicle or you can just put it up on the roof but regardless you're gonna get the best signal possible wherever you're at so this isn't something again JVC is deployed they've got you can see the kit here with a broadcast vehicle that they've created and so it's just a roof rack mountable kit so they've got a bracket that has this HD to ip67 all the antennas everything ready to go easily easily mounted on a roof rack and then you just run one cable inside for power and you're ready to go so here you can see the to ip67 sitting in the middle of that bracket and then you've got the cellular antennas danced around the outside there so again you can use Wi-Fi to get multiple cameras connected to this JVC's professional broadcast camera support Wi-Fi as an uplink and so with this mobile kit you can show up park get your get your up links already and then you've got your five gigahertz and 2.4 gigahertz hotspots to get all your cameras linked up so you can get several people broadcasting at once from one kit and again you just need a router or a cloud appliance on the other side to put all the video back together and again the nice thing with this is you can have either one fusion hub or one physical router or you can have a fusion hub and a physical router at your headquarters but you can have as many of these mobile kits as you want so they don't have to all be on at the same time you can deploy vehicles or backpack units as you see fit and again just turn them on and they're ready to go so they're there peace we'll talk about our antennas obviously you need good signal to get broadcasting to get good broadcasts out in the field and so we've got our new antenna 1:07 which is a 4 by 4 my mo antenna so you can either hook up to lower category LTE radios to this so anything below category 18 you can get two radios connected to this over with category 18 gigabit LTE you need four connections for one radio so this is a great fit for again dual modem or single modem of the the gigabit LTE connections super wide frequency range so all the new bands of carriers are using this is going to support pretty much all of them now if we look inside we've got several options to pick from there so in your in your and your broadcast facilities the brick-and-mortar sites that you've got something like an SD X is a great product to deploy in those locations it's a modular router it's over ten Giga throughput capable so you could scale up all kinds of broadcast units just to phone home to something like this now that modular slot on the right you can have fiber connections you can have LTE connections and then you've also got fiber connections and and Ethernet connections built in so you can mix all kinds of different LANs that you're at your core site with this great router now this router along with all of the mobile units we've shown you are all centrally manageable from our in control system so you can keep track on the map of where everything is and basically orchestrate the entire broadcast deployment from anywhere in the world here's a look at those expansion modules that are available for this router now this is something you could put in a mobile vehicle as well if you really needed high high horsepower out out in the field again I think the mbx that that quad modem solution might be a little bit better fit but depending on what you're deploying you need more horsepower at the router this is definitely an option - we've got some mobile medical and broadcasters who have chosen to deploy this out in there and their mobile mobile units as well so another thing that we're going to start deploying is speed fusion as a service or speed fusion cloud so that you can deploy these mobile units without having to have that office side or cloud side infrastructure so we'll do that that bonding piece for you so you'll be able to just buy the kits and subscribe to this service so that you don't have more infrastructure to deal with me you might not have the staff to deal with that or to stand that up and so Peplink is gonna create an offering where that's something that they can just subscribe to and be able to deploy that even easier without having to setup that cloud side infrastructure look for that to come out later this year so that covers all the topics that I had I'm just gonna look at the Q&A here and see if we've got any questions waiting I see one question about does the Ethernet support POA I'm not sure which model specifically that was referring to but just going backwards on some of the models there the HD for mbx supplies POA on it's ports that s DX has p OE on it's Ethernet ports that ip67 that outdoor unit receives p OE so it's p OE powered so that that's really easy to deploy wherever you have the best signal so I don't know if that covers the question exactly or not but feel free to tag onto that if you've got more questions on that topic specifically Daniel ok so I see Daniels looking more specifically I think on the speed fusion engine we'll go back and take a look at that one I there is not p OE support on that but we can look at the different power options on it ok so this unit will take 12 or 24 volt DC and on that terminal block or you can do 5 volt DC via USB on that micro USB connector there I don't believe there's p OE input and I know there's not POA output on that port a lot of people deploy this with off-the-shelf USB power banks is a pretty common deployment scenario for this one all right if there's any other questions feel free to throw those in right now I'll give it just another minute or two to see if any other questions come in alright folks I'll let you get back to your days thank you so much for attending feel free to reach out marketing at Pep linked comm is a great place for any product questions if you've got a Peplink partner you're working with already talk to them first they know what they're doing we make sure of it so either way you're in good hands thank you so much folks goodbye"}

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "so welcome to Publix broadcasting webinar we're gonna roll through originally we scheduled about three different cases and throughout the revision of that presentation I believe we have five now five different cases so it's really interesting it will go through every one is a stackable solution when I say stackable that means I can take the solution from the first case I can apply it in the second case I can scale in I can apply to the third case I can scale that and etc so that's pretty amazing we're not talking about fixated solutions that only applies to one specific case and is non-reusable all of our coupling solutions are basically building blocks in the sv1 or networking industry you can take it apart you can put it together you can reconfigure it to meet the needs of your clients anytime anywhere so what is Peplink if anybody asks you what is Peplink one you've never heard of it - you have no idea what SD man is that's okay we are the unbreakable connectivity company period we offered this solution anytime 24/7 365 anywhere in the world with whatever when is available I say that literally anywhere and when I go do all the cases you will realize that everything I just said is absolutely true so let's go into the first case to whet their appetite and see what we can do so how first case is based on uninterrupted radio transmission so when I'm talking about interrupted radio transmission I'm not talking about studio bass I'm talking about 100% in the wild mobile that means my studio crew and my partner can go to any site in the world and still broadcast back to their audience in near-real-time okay so let's look at a case and what the case is about and what their challenges are so my partner Stephon Ballmer the audio and IT officer at one on four point six RTL radio in Germany so for all my German friends please tune into that and get stuff on some support and our great partner the TEL gmbh also based in germany they were challenged of a solution to put together a huge outdoor concert the concert is called free floor starts for free if you are in Germany you notice it's an annual thing 100% free look at that picture you can see the amount of attendees the world are the challenges to do a peer real-time broadcast back to the worldwide audience first one of the requirements was the best of quality with absolutely zero disturbance to the listener the listener cannot discern that he is not even there he believed he or she believes they're physically present at the event with that type of quality - they need the best possible real-time performance when we talk about real time we're not talking about 10 minute 5 minute or even a 1 minute delay the end user who is listening in must feel they are in sync in real-time with the rest of the audience live at that event and it has to be easy to use because the people who are setting up these concerts are technically may not be networking specialist they are broadcast their video photographers they are you know AV and audio type people ok not necessarily a peer ID networking but our solution must be easy to use must work every time so I'm going to ask my participants who are members of the Peplink family today if you are developing the solution and you are brought to this case to develop another on-site project for audio concert what would you recommend to be the solution okay take a look at that picture think about the audio requirements real time that's the quality easy to use do you guys want some hints let's give you guys some hints I'll give you one minute think about it and I want my existing members to key up what they recommend would be the solution okay you so my audience for my partners what would you recommend hey Christopher Maxon the goal possible did you guys spy some cool Peplink gear hidden away in those pictures anybody else okay let's jump into it okay so the solution got our partners Patel and Stefan put together or a group of devices and we'll go through each one of why they chose that so they chose a balance 380 a max HD for mbx and a max HD 2 they created speed fusion tunnel with children latency tuning and they were able to implement a dedicated voice over IP between our virtual device fusion hub back to the HD for fighter red on-site dialing and it took them from 0 to 3 weeks to live deployment including all configuration in all integration so let's go through it we started with a balanced 380 enterprise grade router at the main studio we paired up twin DSL connections for a wide broadband connectivity solution a fat pipe to download all the data that Stefan will put up next Stefan has set up a primary radio transmission kick HT for mbx with plot that's for multi LTE wins that's a primary transmission device but there's more Stefan also set up a secondary studio with HD 2 now this can operate as a backup or as a secondary studio for live audio commentary so you can imagine these two are live and enabled at any site and how do we enable all this between the audio encoders from the musicians from their instruments into the audio encoders our wireless LTE solution we create a proprietary speed fusion tunnel with jitter and latency tuning we would prioritize audio over all existing traffic back to headquarters and in the cloud without fusion hub at the headquarters they were able to create a direct dialing voice over IP to the mobile studio they literally literary carry a phone with them and the studio can dial into Stefan or Stefan could dial back into the studio and do live audio tollans you can tune down specify that to the crew directly for tuning or you can actually have consumed call ins to come in under during the during the broadcast and the reason we chose them we picked our stuff while I was because he was the winner in our photo contest from January and you can see his latest deployment right there now this case will talk about in a future after Stefan now sets it up then sends us the right on there obviously this is in the Caribbean but one of the things that he's done in this type of the case scenario is that he's able to incorporate Magnus microphones for ambient sound to bring to environment back to the listener now I want to also point out that Stefan Zephyr are fully paid off because not only it was he the photo winner he was also the first winner of our balanced 20x and with the balance 20 yet he has set up a third mobile studio with a young hot ql1 digital audio mixer radial microphones and I am as a third mobile studio so as a reminder for our existing partners and possibly new end users if you have deployed a really cool and kick-ass broadcasting solution or any Network solution using trembling gear why don't you send a picture in and you can be eligible to win one of the many other devices that were given away every month now I believe I talk to you marketing earlier and I believe there were no submissions for large so far huge opportunity to win some free gear from Peplink based on your efforts so are there any questions regarding the first case with audio mixing on the go this is a 100% completely wireless solution it's available everywhere it offers massive bandwidth back up into the cloud and back to the studio if you're asking me what's the maximum bandwidth MDX can uplink dan do you know that 2.5 2.5 to 140 convinced ok well what is the VPN encrypted bandwidth off the MDX yeah we're do you hear that we're pushing 500 up to 600 megabits of bandwidth you can give every single musician their own personal audio track and master that audio back to the studio or into the cloud with our solution fully encrypt into your own private data center there are no subscription fees there are no cloud overhead there are no additional licensing fees it's a one-time investment into your solution and you can reap the rewards on a daily basis based off that ok so let's move on to the next so what are the let's summarize are technologies that enable this solution for Stefan that no other provider can one we offer a bandwidth bonding solution were able to take multiple LTE solutions in the field and combine it into a fat pipe basically mobile broadband to our Lance moving technology can help prioritize latency and packet duplication to offset any packet loss or any jitter ensuring to Stefan and his team a peer low latency experience for all their listeners and of course we encrypt that over a VPN solution for security for your clients our products are completely when agnostic so what it says when agnostic means it basically means that you could use any available when connection and create a virtualized unbreakable secure connection and when I say any I literally mean it our devices have multiple LAN ports over Ethernet we have multiple LTE ports we also have built-in Wi-Fi that can be used as both Wi-Fi as ap or Wi-Fi as when and I'll talk about that in the next case and we can guarantee quality for your transmissions Lance moving enables you to have a perfectly consistent quality as good as fiber-optic or land base connectivity over wireless you're also an agile because you can pick and choose what's available per region if you're going to a region where 3G is better and we use multiple 3G if you're going to a region where you have both instant fiber-optic and DSL then you can plug that in or if you need 4G you can have multiples of it or any hybrids of that and in the near future guess what we are 5g ready ages hot-swap a module into our devices and your 5g ready your investment is protected I don't think you're gonna find another solution that can offer you all of that out of the box except from pedaling so let's talk about our next case so one of the things that step one could have done was with all that massive broadband bandwidth was what add video right he could have been the next Michael Bay creating the next MTV well let's look at a mobile video solution that requires that and what are their challenges and let's see what the solution was so our second case was marathon broadcasting by our friends Cyn our certified distributor in Thailand now Dare case is pretty unique and I really want to emphasize this case a little bit because it's sports season it's probably the biggest growth market for broadcasting it's sports if you're in Europe the number one market is what it's football oh hi all you ask in the BR one mini combine LTE and wireless it can do load balancing between the two the BR one does not offer a bonding solution but you can look at something like a balanced 30 pearl that has a single LTE plus multiple LANs and yes that will allow bonding plus way it's moving so let's go back to the marathon case we have an outdoor marathon case out in the wild it's 42 kilometers long you have two or 10,000 participants you have nearly 10,000 actually finished and it starts in the middle of the night so what are some of the challenges that you can envision right away you are the technology partner your local marathon our event coordinators asking for your help what are some of the challenges the number one thing is while the long distance that you have to traverse and cover throughout the event at minimum at minimum you have you travel 21 kilometers halfway assuming is the same route back in four that's minimum number two how are you going to monitor over 10,000 participants reality will say in sports broadcasting you will not you will more than likely track the top 10 top 20 participants because that's where the most interest is okay number 3 you're in an outdoor environment you cannot guarantee the infrastructure is already available and you have to do a rapid deployment to get it up and running Plus what happens after the event how are you gonna manage the teardown can you imagine trying to pull fiber optic into the site and then tearing it all down right out there for a 2-day even it's insane and forth how are you gonna manage real-time low latency multi casting with commentating you could attract them runners or the participants you also have to do to do live cut ins for the sports commentators and you have to combine everything back it up and transmit that to all the viewers so I'm gonna give you one minute for our existing partners if you think of what would you advise as the ideal solution in such a use case and I will give you some hints to see what it entails so this is all live footage in real time from the actual you can see we have traveling monitoring traveling a video to photographers we have music cut in and we have live commentating voice overlay in real time throughout the event especially for the top guys so what kind of solution as our partners when you advise your customers from helping to enable this solution we're talk about multiple cameras we're talking about live voice commentating integrated everything's broadcast in near real time we're talking about less than one minute one minute latency between shooting that video cutting it integrating it backing it up on a cloud and broadcasting it and remember there's multiple cameras there's no way you can achieve all this with a single camera crew I hear balance 20x from Christopher salsas where they use HD - do we have any more recommendations from our Peplink partners no okay let's take a look at the real world solution so these were all the challenges multiple runners different locations seamless commentary integration live multicast streaming near real-time it's actually a one-day event think about the teardown and set up and there you are completely infrastructure challenged serve our partner at Cyn has put together an amazing solution and it's I thought it's pretty ingenious let's check it out Cyn was able to deliver a seamless integrated and multicast solution to the bank is in Chonburi marathon they're using motor baut cameramen with multiple drivers using a completely wireless video photographer solution on-site mobile media station tie two commentators plus video editing crew uploading all of that back to the cloud for backup and live transmission in multi casting to the audience in this specific scenario our team use speech fusion engine Wireless 4G LTE with video encoders integrated into the back packs of the video photographers we use a max HD for that the mobile command center to capture that video cut in live commentary audio and then push everything back up into the cloud and in Tunis cloud-based streaming service the winning factors ultra compact size with super low power consumption based 100% on batteries speed fusion engine combines twin high-speed cellular connections HD for super broadband support with 4 active Cellular's that can rotate between up to 8 different SIM cards for flawless and the best of connectivity at any time during the event but let's take a deeper look at this solution so song you did a really great job HD 2 was very very close to what they actually use so our video photographers were riding on with mobile drivers on mopeds they were able to track the top 10 runners throughout the event each moment had a dedicated video photography sitting on it and filming live okay basically streaming off twin cellular connectivity solution from public they were piped a video stream from the camera into an encoder and we pass through the speed fusion engine speed fusion engine creates a broadband VPN back to the HD 4 located at a command center for minimize latency so basically gonna bounce to the cell tower from cell tower back down literally in the same location roughly the live video V's are then combined at the command center at the same time the commentators are watching a live video feed that's decoded into small portable screens and then the audio is MUX into the upstream it's sent back into a second encoder up to the server's data center and then broadcasted live so to HD for uploads video stream back to the data center live let's look at how it's done there you go over here we can see dusty fusion engine the built-in antennas with 2 by 2 mile connection that's the video encoder that's tied directly to the cameras they were using at that time this is the battery pack that supplies all the power this is a 100% wireless solution the only tether the only tether is that cable between the camera and the encoder that's it there are no other wires in this at the mobile command center we see HD for all the yellow wires are the IP input so the HD 4 is pulling down the video from multiple HD juice it feeds the video feed back into these decoders these are Tara tech decoders at 1080p you can read that screen right there these are fed into multiple screens live at the mobile command center where the commentators are choosing and switching between a B C and D video photographers and making commentary they could choose the top runner or the top crew or the most exciting they can also really only head to the driver and say hey I want you to pull back and then shoot somebody and then when the video stream comes online they could cut back in then the blue wire shows the video in corridor sending the upstream fully monks back to the cloud for backup and then broadcast it to everybody now I want to ask you something because this will be asked for our new users okay what kind of performance are we looking at so Dan can you tell me what is the max upload bandwidth for a speech fusion engine per video stream okay and if we have to encrypt that under VPN that is correct 40 megabits per video stream so let me ask my broadcasting viewers who know more than I do what is the average megabits per video stream that you need to ensure at minimum a 1080p stream in h.264 encoding can somebody tell me okay I'll give you three seconds to answer because I know it off the top of my head I did my research if SRT 22 25 megabits okay okay for most of our stuff 6 megabits okay none of you are wrong none of you are wrong if I was encoding in raw in raw it would be about 20 25 megabits per stream and Dan just said that that SF ICI fusion engine pushes 40 megabits each that means I have plenty of bandwidth to push a raw stream master video from every single one of my cam plus audio if you're doing h.264 encoding live you're gonna pull between 8 to 12 megabits if you're doing hav ch2 h.265 you're between 4 to 6 megabits so remember we're pushing at minimum and these are 2 6 4 video streams as far as I know and minimum we're pushing 4 by 8 megabyte megabits so that's what 36 megabits in total not including any latency lost packet or jitter I'm gonna ask you do you know of any other solution on the market that can guarantee you that I don't know okay I know there are a lot of bonding solutions but I know they're not gonna be able to push that kind of throw PUD and then imagine you're at the mobile command center your real-time muxing and commentating in music and commercials and etc in real time and you need to backup that master video back to the cloud you're gonna push that minimum 30 60 40 megabits uplink plus audio and etc that's why our guys at cyn place a HD 4 at the mobile command center and then just for our audience what is the max VPN encrypted bandwidth the HD 4 can push uplink it's 100 it's 100 megabits I just told you for this video stream at h.264 that we needed a minimum 30 6 megabits for master video and we can push 100 that means we can actually double the number of photographers or we can actually quadruple the number of video telephone photographers if we use a better encoder in h.265 with audio [Music] so for my broadcast specialists was I wrong in any of my numbers would that be an ideal or worthwhile solution for you to have I'm gonna tell you right now today tits 1080p is the minimum what what about in the future if you're trying to shoot 4k master video what is the minimum bandwidth for that or what if in the future you are shooting 8k master video but you do you 4k broadcasting okay I don't know anybody that shoots 4k and and then displays 4k because there will be artifacts you gotta clean it up but usually you shoot at a higher resolution than what you need as the master video for future editing and then you broadcast at a slightly lower resolution based on you know the needs of the consumers yeah so ever as you said the 4k video needs a minimum of 15 megabits so our solution today from Cyn can transmit 4k master video as is Cyril upgrade with low latency fully encrypted under a 256 bit security cipher then nobody can steal from you but what is more important for video broadcasters all the data that goes to your nominated data center or headquarters there are no third-party solution that will hijack your video that will have access to it it's all 100% protected to the destination of your choice plus did I mention then do we charge any subscription fees zero what is the end what are the annual fees after you buy a device from Peplink okay besides the hardware warranty are there any outstanding licensing fees that our he cut me off there are zero licensing fees there are zero feature fees there are zero subscription fees you pay for the solution you determine the host or the backup data center you want all the data is yours it's fully encrypted you shoot it you save it you broadcast it you own it ok so if you're shooting 4k at 50 megabits its megabits is not megabytes of eight times that's 50 megabytes is 400 megabits okay if you really need that kind of solution ain't no problem you know maybe you're shooting raw or maybe you have to 8k camera you actually don't know I have the solution for you thought okay we'll jump into that in a little bit okay let's go into the next case okay let's take a little quick deep dive into the speed fusion engine just to make an introduction and then we're gonna keep escalating and go zero go all the way up to our powerhouse broadcasting solutions so this is a speed fusion engine it is literally the size of a small mobile phone it is in fact smaller than my mobile phone and I will tell you my screen is seven inches in diameter okay it's a small little box has twin LTE cellular solution you can see has dual SIM cards right there in front of you it's 100% powered by battery or direct DC input there's a three quarter side view fully plug in play remember when you buy a penny solution we take care of you with a fully managed service through IC - that's our integrated as the UN controller fully in the cloud you can log in anytime from any device PC Mac tablet mobile devices you can log into your device check the status set access to not tuned down bandwidth requirements and etc now I want to talk about done what if you need an a solution that's outdoor ready you don't have a backpack you want to mount it somewhere such as I want to put on my scooter again or I want to put it on my vehicle what would you recommend what if we wanted a outdoor solution but we have to be aware of the environment sea water saltwater rain we high p55 is a minimum ip67 so we do have an outdoor solution with the same performance so let's take a look at that that's a beautiful little box have I ever seen one this is our ip67 version of technically the speech fusion engine is a HD 2 mounted into an IP 6 super rugged durable case for harsh environment and how would you use this in broadcasting well based on my marathon solution not every country have access these scooters are is not allowed or even motorcycles a lot of people would have camera crews based on vans or cars or any other type of vehicles but they also don't have the space to mount it inside they would like to put it outside so this is an ideal system and let's see how we can use it in a real-world situation so let's take a quick intro into the box they do cellular it has redundant Sims that means has a maximum of four sims to active to on standby and I'll rotate between the four based on quality again I mentioned Super Duty ip67 enclosure shockproof vibration proof harsh weather proof mother nature approved speed fusion bonding when smoothing seamless failover all the VP and goodness that I just talked about optional POA input you can literally just plug a single p OE cable into an empowered on no cable mess and how would you use it so Dan I think you know more about this case than I do do you want to introduce us to these guys only from JVC based in where in Mexico [Music] okay well globally so JVC came to us looking for an IP broadcasting solution and they you wanted something outdoor environment friendly so you can see they didn't have access to cool scooters like we have in Asia here they have a big deal of fave SUV you know oh how terrible so they wanted any live broadcast where camera mobility and high reliability are paramount they would do live encoding in the field but they needed more latency and this is how their solution was and it's a little bit different from CY hands so let's take a look at it they would use JVC professional cameras were in bridge camera adapter they would mount our harsh environment HD to ip67 bonding router onto the rooftop they would add high gain LTE antennas for broadband transmission back to the cloud backup in live stream backhauls and they would have a VPN router at the facility that's either data center or headquarters utilizing any balance 380 and they would handle up to 20 different cellular links incoming but let's take a deeper dive into their solution and see how he set that up oops professional cameras with built-in IP encoders so this one's a more elegant solution the encoders are ready in the camera there's no external box that's one last box it would capture the video encoding and then it was sent over a Wi-Fi five gigahertz bridge the bridge would send the video back to the Wi-Fi input mounted on top of the car and they're using an external five gigahertz specialized harsh weather antenna then the Wi-Fi would transmit that IP encode and video stream back into our HD for excuse me HD - we do have HD for variation the HD - with the hiking say of antenna creates a bond aggregated signal from multiple carriers to active - on standby back to their private data center 100% fully encrypted 100% fully privatized at the studio JVC would receive this data stream via our balance 380 at the same time there they are able to receive up to 220 different live camera crew transmissions worldwide that's a pretty scalable solution again let's go back to math questions if you're shooting a single HD stream a 1 HD stream per camera let's say it's 8 megabits and you have 20 different worldwide crews and operations simultaneously what is the bandwidth requirement that you need that's 80 times 20 megabits minimum that's 160 megabits of VPN fully private and equipped so we can offer you that type of solution today or if you need to scale out we can go even further so in this situation this was a IP camera - Wi-Fi prehension - LTE back to balance 380 optionally you can technically put a fusion home virtual device in the cloud somewhere here and you can sign in Kania slee send a signal to the cloud and then down as a backup so you can off-site storage of all your mastered video and audio automatically you don't even have to worry about it you just do the cutting and pasting and [Music] broadcasting from the studio by pulling the roll feed off the cloud and editing it before you send out to your consumers so what if you wanted a more elegant solution then okay I don't want that Wi-Fi box I want to minimize I want to minimize the number of points of failure what can we do yes so so the JDC come to you after this project and say hey we want a more elegant solution gets embedded in the camera with one less box so basically JVC came to Denison I want to getting rid of this antenna this box and these four tenant antennas off the car and I want to integrate that into a simple box solution is that correct okay so guess well would it be cool we have this kind of solution for our partners audience what do you think if we can take all of these antennas and this box and we somehow create a single box and simplify it would that be a very cool solution for you to have able to broadcast 4k wall video live back to your data center with minimal input so let's take a look at that introducing speed fusion cam this is our brand new do cellular bonding solution for professional IP cameras and it comes with two different compatibility mounts we have the gold the gold or AV mount we have a v-mail it's Universal for most of the professional class IP cameras out there with built-in encoders we have built-in redundant sims there's four you count it one two three four we have additional Wynn and LAN and we have a additional Wi-Fi part that can access that can act as AP or Wi-Fi as when and we have input and on an off switch now how does it look we mounted to the camera there it is we completely took the solution that was previously mounted on the JVC car and we made it into this little box small simple elegant we allow a piggy bank mount to put the camera battery so now we have a 100% wireless solution integrated into the camera for up to 40 megabits of encrypted through a plug live video streaming no wire mess 100% portable but Dan what if like Saul says he wants more bandwidth he says the hd2 is not enough he wants a little bit more than 40 megabits what can we do for him octopus confusion carrots so did you hear that what if you needed more power in the field and one speed fusion engine or speakership engine camp is not enough per camera you can set the built-in IEP as Wi-Fi as when and add wireless lans to it through a second speed fusion engine or speed fusion engine cam or even mobile phone that you may have it will combine all the additional wins you can given to increase the bandwidth in the field 100% completely wireless I really don't know of any other solution that offers that amount of flexibility or when agility in the field so this is how you would set it up first you mount a speed fusion engine cam onto a camera and you enable the VPN and you broadcast back directly to the data center using bonded bandwidth which ensures consistent and reliable connectivity within the speed fusion connection our algorithms will monitor the traffic and work with the bandwidth available to ensure a smooth error and jitter free connection will have no packet loss at the data center the balance router would pull down the video feed and forward it to the media server for decoding and post-processing remember if you insert a virtual fusion hub into step three you can technically do live simultaneous backup of your master video without you even touching it and the speed fusion engine cam includes a Wi-Fi radio which can act as both an AP or Wi-Fi LAN port for additional bandwidth as needed in the field and here we were demonstrating this at last year's nab show you can see this gentleman is playing with the camera you can see the relative size of that the relative scale it is fairly small there are no wires no tether he's pushing 40 megabits 4k bandwidth up here this was live streaming right here back here if you attend the next nap show you can see our team demonstrating this throughout partnerships if you are a new number of complaint or a non member of a plane you can reach out to any of our partners and ask for a demo today this is openly available and I will tell you right now it is 100% certified to work with JVC IP cameras today if you are using a different brand of cameras we welcome to work with you to certify our system for those cameras just reach out to us at sales at kept me calm and we'll pass you faster contact directly to the regional partner but there's more there's more that we can do now outside of sports broadcasting and live concert viewing what else can we do with our system let's take a quick look so do you need more bandwidth we do offer our 4k and 8k solution this is the HD 4 mb x quad Seiler gigabit LTE mobile powerhouse this is the device it comes with a triple and port 8 LAN ports two USB that can be enabled as USB in for when or out-of-band management has four built in LTE and Wi-Fi that's a lot of land ports that's three plus two plus four plus two is that right there on the Wi-Fi we can have separate when boards on the 2.4 and 5 gigahertz okay that's like 9 anything if my math is not wrong one more this is also hot swappable in the future if you make an investment in this platform you can upgrade into 5g when it becomes available in your region ok this pushes 2.5 gigabytes of raw throughput but what is still encrypted performance through the MB x10 okay 500 megabits so 500 mega minutes so I'm gonna go back to solve you said 4 K was 15 megabytes which was 400 megabits I think your talk about 8 K wrong I mean unencoded or all video would be yeah the MDS will push it anymore okay I believe a 4k video master stream is about 20 megabits so you're pushing 500 megabits you're gonna push 25 4k master video streams through this box uplink imagine if you're doing is flow sports broadcasting session and you needed that kind of solution to watch the next World Cup or something like that or formula 1 you need 4k master video or even a team that's their video this is the box to help you do it and let's talk about a real-world use case where somebody actually did done so last year in the US we were working with a USC team they traveled the world especially in the Nordic countries competing in ski events they needed a solution one that was shooting a high quality master video they would broadcast that video back to their headquarters before they would do cutting and editing for consumer viewing they also needed some form of live streaming cut in they also needed to provide broadband connectivity for the ski team in between their runs so we use the HD for MVX as their solution we tested this with them they mount it in a travel trailer that traveled across multiple countries in North America Europe etc and they trailer act as a central broadcasting hub to all the partners for the US Ski Team as far as I know I believe in other news crew use that as a whole thing so what were the winning factors hi throwing 500 megabits fully encrypted if you need a little bit more bandwidth and you're not so sensitive about encryption you can push up to 2.5 k up to supports world wide band frequencies it's future-proof it's easy to upgrade and more importantly it's super durable you can imagine the ski team traveling to minus 30 degrees Celsius weather for the competitions the mb/s has proven itself in that harsh weather through and through then you can see it right there so let's look at their deployment how they did it mbx installed inside their wax charger multiple SIM cards with world plans are embedded and it provides a local Wi-Fi connectivity for all the crew and news members and live camera feeds if need be through bridging the MDX aggregates up to four cellular level links into a high-speed unbreakable resilient and secure SD LAN connection into the Internet and it operates from uninterrupted access to weather databases and changing information on the events you can do even live streaming you just connect that camera either via Wi-Fi or you can connect it via one of our speed fusion engine cam solutions create a VPN with a very low latency connection back to the HD for MVX remember you can augment all of this with Wi-Fi in between if it's available if it's not available you can Wi-Fi as when into mobile phones for emergency use if need be and our built in speed fusion technology has packet compensation packet loss and jitter jitter free minimization to help ensure the stream is high quality and smooth on the receiving end so no matter how the quality is during the transport of any of the four different cellular connections we will take all of them find the best stuff and use that connection can assure a total free smooth video stream up back to the data center and a headquarters now there are other use kids as besides sports treatment what about malign you cast live music a speck okay so what are the difference between live sports casting and live newscast thing in sports casting the event it's fixated in a location there is a limit to where the boundaries about that event will be okay it's designated so you can plan ahead you know from when end of the field to the other end or one end of the track to the other track what if you're chasing real-time weather news okay what some of the challenges be so in this use case in the United States our friends and wcy btv they had built a new storm tracker vehicle that goes out to shoot weather in live video in bad weather the some of their challenges were that in the previous technology base they were using microwave and what are some of the cabinet's of microwave they had to set up the uplink before they shot the video if they wanted to do live okay what does a set of time number two what if their weather condition changes have moved yet the teardown packing up go to a new location set it up then shun feeling technically you're losing time also the weather has a lot of cameras mounted so technically they almost cannot shoot a lot of live video as they're driving down trying to capture it because microwave is directional okay it is not 360 omnidirectional kind of but anyway so you have to set it up there's a lot of down time so what would you do for my partners what kind of solution would you offer to our partners as a mobile solution that is real-time instinct and they can shoot at sight and at will for a live TV camera crew what would you recommend to that partner I'll give you ten seconds five four three two and one let's take a look at the solution that they use they tore down their previous microwave solution and they used a quad cellular HD for routing solution it allows multiple web inputs and multiple IP feeds they can fully stream while in motion that means cameras out trapping the storms or the tornados as soon as they're shooting they are encoding they are up streaming it's easily mounted into any production vehicle such as their trucks production vans and weather vehicle it is easy to use for their operators as well because they basically flip it on and all the settings are enabled and it provides a broadband internet uplink available to all reporters as well so they can type up scripts and set up recaps back to the new stations for follow-up news broadcasting so they can one do live transmission website as it happens and to that you can clarify and edit the news briefing for follow up to start with the HD format in the vehicle cameras would take their HD SDI it video stream or go to encoder and then it goes directly through an Ethernet port into the HD for IP video is transmitted under a secured broadband connection fully encrypted across for LTE this is sent back to their headquarters at the studio the video is converted back to HD SDI through the decoder and the reporters and TV news team can pull down the video in near-real-time and start editing the video for subsequent transmissions or they can do a pass through life into a previously set of weather template for live streaming this with multiple LTE connection it guarantees one resiliency just in case any single LT Goes Down they are still transmitting - they utilize all the available broadband bandwidth to ensure they get that video up there as rapidly as possible 3 the aggregated bandwidth allows them to shoot high quality video stream where in the past they would have to trip down to a lower quality because of physical limitations in technology today you can scale up as Dan said up to 500 megabits of raw video stream fully encrypted hey Caesar your question is can to achieve or pass SRT protocol strings and that's a very good question we'll check it get back to you on that as far as I know I actually don't know that specific answer but what we do is as long as the video stream was initially IP we encrypted as is and we shoot it across and then the encoder would be cold the SRT stream it's the same thing in our solutions for enterprise we take proprietary MPLS solutions that have their own technology and we just do it pass through so we treat it as a big win but I want to emphasize the router is not the only solution now 50% at a time when our partners are shooting or transmitting IP in the wild they may say well I'm not getting enough bandwidth it is not the fault of the device it may be a limitation or competition from the cell towers due to all the users in the area that's why so how can you supplement that we recommend that you look at antennas so the built-in antennas in every single Peplink product are between 2.5 to 3 DB I game already so what if you're traveling what if you're going to a far remote place what if you're mobile you cannot guarantee the sustained cellular quality from that cell tower or the range right so any of my RF engineers out there can you verify that can you sustain consistent radio signal quality if you're moving around that yes or no okay well I'll tell you if previously all my art of Engineers Adobe known so how do you augment that what you can do is use our new high dbi antenna to augment that so let me introduce the AMT 107 this is our sixty by four by four mile high gain antenna for LTE it has a wide ban of frequency between 69830 hundred megahertz it comes with four LTE SMA connectors so if you are using our dual cellular device all you need is one antenna every cellular device from cat 12 and down has two connectors for antenna this antenna has four so one of these antenna which are ip67 proof can improve your radio signal gain up to what is it two two two six power step 256 no that's - 26 DVI 226 okay so we can improve your radial gain with our antenna now if you're using cat 18 modems devices that you a need a minimum one of these antenna per device but what are you buying you're buying consistency of quality and radial gain when you're moving around so for TV news broadcasting what if you are trying to track down weather storms lightning thunder tornadoes can my RF engineers out there tell me does lightning rain and harsh weather affect radio signals the answer is actually yes it can so if you're in that type of environment or you're looking to go into that environment and you need to shoot live video and you want to guarantee the highest quality available to you and you're competing with everybody else using their cell phones taking videos and streaming it social media you should look at adding and augmenting your existing solution with a high-speed antenna this is available down from our partners with any coupling solution okay it's also available at an incredible deal today can we talk about the MSRP price on public okay I will let you know my partners I will share with you a little advance notice please ask us what the cost is my end users please ask me what is the cost okay don't be afraid to challenge us let's make a deal now I want to finish off with what can we do today all those cases that I talked about were from previous and when I say previous was between a couple of years ago up till last year and the beginning of this year but at peplum we are a dynamic company we are constantly developing so what do we have new in the pipeline so we previously I believe January February we just recently disc order announced the brand view STX it's our modular enterprise-grade router and why am i recommending this one of broadcasting partners one you saw a lot of our partners use a balanced 380 the ballast 380 you can support back then 20 video streams at 1080p what is the upcoming standard it's going to be 4k for master video at minimum more than I do if you're doing hardcore broadcasting or filming you're looking at ek when you're looking at higher video resolution you need more bandwidth you need more powerful box to help you push that kind broadband so the SDX is our brand view enterprise-grade it has two LAN ports two USB ports these are when incoming you could have USB out-of-band management to s7p take your ease airports there's the when excuse me that was console port eight LAN ports and upgradeable module the upgradeable module allows you to expand on your investment without losing it you don't throw in the boxes away you just make a nominal upgrade in the future and you keep you don't change your network whatsoever here's the rundown of what you can do with this box it's also a slim one new configuration this is nearly imperfect for those environments where it's very tight and you're tight on space you can put this in your data center headquarters you can literally put this in your mobile command center if need be ok but what kind of modules do I have well how do you benefit a mobile broadcast solution let's take a look at the modules today we offer a triple LTE a module that's three LTE a module with the GPS you can use that as your wireless broadband right there you can also expand to a Giga a third POV module this is when our land enabled it's up to you or you can switch over here to a quad SFP+ port module if you have for corporate use more than likely but the exciting thing about the STX is that we will make available 5g modules in the future so your device in your investment today is protected through our expandable module line and it has the horsepower to push your video needs lastly this is one of the things that our partners always ask us especially the new end users I really like your devices Anthony Dan you did a really great job on that speech fusion engine can I pop it on my IP camera I'm completely wireless but but yeah there's this but I have to set up the end point you are correct you really do need to set up the secondary endpoint to enable the VPN the winds moving and the bonding but I don't want a hassle with that I just want to buy box I just want to plug it into my camera I want to start shooting and I want all that speed fusion benefit can you help me well dad heard your call so did marketing yes we can coming soon this year in 2020 Peplink and through our partners will offer you a subscription model base endpoint you don't set it up yourself you invest in our initial devices got a 5g ready to a speed fusion we will provide a fully set up speech fusion excuse me fusion hub in the cloud that will allow you to connect you for a fee now this is just to get you going until you get familiarized in the future you can do a rolling expansion of your network to put in private boxes in your cloud in your data center at your headquarters or spin up your own speed fusion enable fusion hub but we offer a pay-as-you-go service with upcoming speed fusion cloud technology we will offer everything as a service you will get access to our Sdn controller you could spin up multiple sizes of the fusion hub depending on the number of peers and devices you need we will offer something brand-new called fusion sim that's 100% similes cellular service where we send you a sim ID from our service to your device so you can literally just pick up the box turn it on and pick a service from one of the services provided by our partners or pebbly and go online or of course you can do it everything manual and have your own private network do your own sourcing if you have any more questions you can also contact us at our website or you can go to our social media channels you can visit our forums and talk to our partners ask them technical questions commercial Christians business questions you can talk to our marketing team and under wishlist you can visit us at linked in or you can drop by and say hi on our Facebook page

out to us at sales at public comm more than happy to talk to you and go through your solutions before you present to your end users my new end users if you're excited and you're intrigued about this please send me in line at sales at public comm more than happy to talk about your existing challenges how to solve it with you and show you what we can do as our partnership and at the end of this presentation you will email everything to you guys one of my request is that there will be a feedback form we weren't based off your feedback what you like when you didn't like what we could have talked about more during the presentation and etc so please advise your feedback how we can do better for you for a future webinar thank you everybody it's been my pleasure talking to you you have been a great audience let me give you a round of applause and I look forward to talking to you again at the next webinar thank you oh excuse me there are some questions that I see in the Q&A box long it's gonna quickly run through it for whoever's still here hi Mohammed yes we will share the presentation with everybody for an email when you get the email link there will be a feedback form with links to presentation and the video for your future use so one of the questions from Y was is it LT a challenge at a concert with that many people they're connecting from the LTE tower okay so I want to say yes if you are at a concert and there are 10,000 people hammering that LTE tower you're gonna get a little bit of bandwidth so I will share with you for Sharon's case it was a audio transmission that was number one so in audio you don't really need a lot of megabits you have a very high quality what do you need and during an audio concert you need we done didn't see that means live transmission from the audio team cannot drop is that correct I think that's more important that's probably the number one thing you cannot drop that connection so having multiple LTE plus you're also able to pull in landlines as available into the max HD for mbx remember MB xs3 when two USB Wi-Fi as when on two channels plus for LTE so that's a lot Theo you said multiple camera teams on motorbikes with transits or other do cellular transmission Hayfield for your question specifically they were using speed fusion engines with encoders per motorcycle team feel [Music] Robin can this be used in a multicam environment on site six cameras and multicam edit over IP yes you can in CY ends case in Thailand for that marathon they had four or more remember that four on mobile motorbikes plus live on the ground camera crew at the start and at checkpoints and at the end so those are stationary cameras plus the mobile command center where they were filming and celebrity commentators so you can imagine how many camera crews they have life Hermey you said what about in control virtual hosted product in the future Hermey for your question for i private in control please email the sales team at peddling calm it is technically feasible depending on your use case for Dave Evans yes so to be your question was so to be clear we have to have a peplum solution at each end or fusion hub in the cloud correct you need a point-to-point solution at minimum and I will tell you right now every peak Peplink purchase device hardware includes one free fusion hub so long that allows one pair for you to test has unlimited bandwidth only limited by your hopes but if you need to aggregate multiple coupling devices into a single cloud or single data center then you will need a hardware device or a fusion hub license with multiple peers Muhammad what about a location where very weak LTE I think no LTE coverage what are some of the solutions Muhammad very incredible question I told you earlier our all of our devices are multi when agnostic whatever when connection you have like literally whatever 3G 4G 5g microwave satellite point-to-point systems DSL fiber-optic whatever you have then you can bond in and create an active connection what you should do is send an email to sales have telecom and we can review your case and we can work with you or the technical difficulties you might have in very remote locations okay I think that's all the questions that I see okay thank you again everybody I really appreciate you sticking around and we're going about 20 minutes over time thank you again have a great day and I look forward to seeing you at the next webinar"}

maritime orientated webinar my name is Sam Norris and I am pip Lynch maritime specialist I used to be an engineer on super yachts then I went shore base to my own kept me doing IT Navy systems for yachts I've recently joined peopling to help drive Kipling forward in the maritime industry it blends mission is to create unbreakable connectivity anytime anywhere pip link is investing in maritime this industry this year today we're going to cover four main topics with relative world situations all of the case studies mentioned we're completed by myself last summer if you have any questions during the session please use the Q&A feature on zoom' and we'll try and answer your questions at the end of the webinar first we'll cover a binge test that was done in port vell bond and on teeth secondly we will cover how to slip the best equipment to install in the maritime environment then we will cover how to best install the equipment for the marine industry lastly we'll cover how to optimize equipment to get the best results firstly we'll start with an install which is not optimal for the clients requirements this install is a few years old and at the time there was a common setup so this Vista was cruising the Mediterranean the Caribbean so doing two seasons some in the mid winter in the Caribbean they want fast reliable internet for the guests they seamlessly transition between different cellular providers what they did was they deployed to the ER ones they had redundant SIM cards for maximum coverage 7ap one a Sima nice for Wi-Fi delivery throughout the vessel and a balance 580 to manage the whole network the way and cellular ones and the APS so what is wrong with this deployment well the 2br ones were been used for maximum coverage and they would go connect and they were great for that then the balance 580 was used to load balance between them so they understood up they weren't using speed fusion this meant they weren't given the best results as the internet really dropped out when they change between providers also HBO 1 is only capable of 100 megabits throughput sometimes this is not enough for 12 gifts so the Berlin's 580 was underutilized because it wasn't being used for speed fusion so ultimately the clients want instant like they get at home 1 gigabit and fiber that kind of stuff this can't be achieved using traditional singular cellular setups so every year we're seeing the data consumption increase 50 to 100 percent at least year-on-year the clients are expecting higher throughput and reliable connections so singular cellular wins and beset are unable to fill these requirements so this test was done in velbon by the captain room and Antibes using speed fusion we roped bond for cellular connections into one fast connection the setup was using the factory standard pic wave antennas in HD for in BX category 12 to SFR SIM cards and to orange some cards and this was bonded back to the data center and Dublin our results using speed fusion we're able to achieve 150 megabits upload and 360 megabits download there was bonded across all four connections so we'll be going back there to the same location soon with an EP extra test there so when you're using a single radio set modem your internet connection can temporarily drop as your modem jumps between different cell towers as you cruise along the coast by using multiple radios we're a much more reliable connection as a likelihood of a secondary connection being active is much higher this allows for a much better solution for the end user so I said within layer speed fusion on top of that and speed fusion ions out the bumps having been with on demand allows you to utilize your internet connection when and where you need it additional bandwidth can be supplied by more SIM cards or even traditional sources like ADSL fiber Wi-Fi or V set if they're available emerging technologies like Leo and 5g will also be supported by Peplink as they become available these are some of our main features of speed fusion bandwidth bonding is combining all your available lengths into one singular single reliable connection this is great for when a vessel as RC in constantly moving between different cellular environments changing coverage and providers and throughput when smoothing creates duplicate packets on the different LANs this means that a single wound fails the missing data does not need to be requested this is great for real-time applications like VoIP and online gaming hot forever allows you to size a single or multiple LANs and failover to a secondary where only when the primary awareness failed this is great if you have a Sun go under data package because you're gonna use additional metered packages as backups but only when required ie the main connection fails next we're going to cover the best selection of equipment so does the perfect solution exists on the seller side no you will never have the best setup for all locations but you can find the middle ground or still prioritizing for longer range connectivity for the local network on the aughts the Pitt wave ecosystem is an amazing solution we are able to monitor the vessels can it give you the whole way from the data center all the way to end-users device we never see this all in one place mean makes troubleshooting much easier and quicker so ad lib is a 40 meter super yacht in 2007 we replaced an old 3G only router with a br one category three modems so that season though they're happy with that unit and the Knicks season though they want to sing more so we we suggest the transit joke with carrier six modems so they went with that for 2018 then at the end there year they said that was great the difference they noticed a mess of this and what else can you do we serve all this the in BX coming out do you want to do you want to have a go with it and they said yeah let's do it so we put the in BX carrier 12 on there for 2018 or 2019 some sorry and they used about a terabyte a month of data with the mbx just for test on ad-lib we did a like-for-like test with a HD for category 4 and an MB XLT a Pro category 12 modems so the main difference was to show the difference between the category of modems and what can be put through the on the speed fusion so for both tests we use the same SIM cards the same antennas and the same speed fusion bonding configuration to the same same data center it was done on the Sunday just sitting on the table nothing no external antennas arancini cable kind of things like there so we did the speed tests with same SIM cards about 10 minutes apart and with the HT for LTE we were gain 33 megabits download and 38 upload on the category 12 we were able to get 151 down and 150 upload 153 upload that was running bonded through speed fusion so the final deployment thread for 2019 was the mb x category 12 and large omnidirectional Marini antennas so with the mb x I was the first person to supply an index since the maritime sector and the results we got were amazing the challenge is now out there for the first partner to install an EP X in the maritime sector so the envy X supports currently supports gigabit LTE its features a swappable cellular modem for 5g upgrade this is protecting your investment as it is future proofed and you can upgrade to the latest technologies the total throughput as the device is 2.5 gigabits per second this gives you plenty of an upper gigabit internet 5g and any other future mobile technologies so the hd4 in me ex is now also available in the category 18 version and we are also introducing now a HD 2 mb x so the hardware platform is the same so the base unit is the same it is the modems that are changing that you just get two modems instead of four so with the carry 18 portfolio on each modem you get up to 1.2 give us download and 150 minutes upload it supports 4x4 MIMO on the download with up to 5 tons carrier creation and on the upload 2 times carrier aggregation so just don't get guys if you have any questions please don't forget to ask them using the Q&A features within zoom or you can send us an email at maritime at pickling calm and we'll answer them at the end of the webinar so antenna selection is a very important part of the system it can make the difference between a great solution and one that won't work so this is pip waves new antenna the antenna 1:07 this is a very compact antenna with six DVD I've gained it features four by four MIMO GPS and as 5g Rudy it's a wide band antenna covering six hundred ninety eight megahertz through to three thousand eight hundred megahertz one ancient supports up to two category twelve modems and one all one category eighteen modem for example in HD for mbx with category 12 ohms would require two of these antennas but a category 18 in BX would require four of these antennas the image is shown here have the qma connectors please note that all category 18 products from Peplink will utilize the qma connectors rather than SMA connection connectors seen on the existing products so the next thing we're going to cover is about the onboard installation so let a tooth they originally had a bo1 mark to lte-a and this supported 4g in Europe and the USA but it wasn't enough there was suffering from brief drops and connectivity this was due to the cellular environment and him jumping between different towers and things like that when we installed the transit duo we installed it directly beneath where the antennas were this allowed for a very very short cable run we implemented speed fusion which allowed for the brief Sally outages to be no longer noticed by the end-user they are now looking at upgrading to an in BX some of the results we got on latitude were pretty amazing they were 50 kilometers or still miles off Norway this summer this I'm just gone and they were gained 10 megawatts down and to me what's up on each SIM card this was the result of using high gain omnidirectional antennas and very short cable runs so next we can have a quick look at the transit duo so the transit juror supports dual cellular modems with redundant SIM slots it is 2.4 and 5 gigahertz LAN and when Wi-Fi there's an extremely compact form factor there's a category 12 modem available which has worldwide coverage great for merit the maritime ministry with our vessels can be moving all over the world it's extremely cost effective under the prime care model so under the prime care model the transit jerkhead over 12 will be 999 euros this is only 250 euros more than the bo1 enterprise with Calgary 12 modems so it brings you a lot more functionality you get dual modems rather than single modems with the prime care you get the speed fusion bonding enabled so yeah the transit Joe should be a standing model for all projects not the BR one so checking the cables antennas or installing the correct equipment so passive splitters half the signal of strength each time you split the signal so if you have a 1 and 4 L passive sweater each modem will only be in a maximum 25 percent of the original signal strength this will reduce your range by 3/4 and seriously affect your throughput long cable runs are also an issue if you have very long cable run the gang you get from your antenna can be lost on the cable run it's similar that the similar kind of rule applies to low quality cables you can lose a lot on them as well lots of connectors so lots of joins SMA 80 in type those kind of adapters you're gonna have to have him somewhere in that and the system but you want to keep them to a minimum so bad antenna locations very common problem for routers not performing it as expected if Roush is installed in the bridge was local antennas and stuffed away in a cupboard and might work I can talk but when the vessel gets 2 miles offshore they'll lose connectivity just remember a lots the holes insulated with insulation which can act as a Faraday cage so if you install sank inside the boat with antennas installed directly on it yeah once you get out of sea it's not going to work so also installing the antennas either side of a large mast with a large metal structure between the two antennas this will also degrade the performance especially if those antennas are on a single modem and this will degrade the forces one intern could have good reception and the other has nothing so good antenna placements another thing and you wanna place your interns as high up as possible with an uninterrupted three on sixth view of the horizon their antennas fiction so low-gain antennas not so good for the memory environment and no grounding so you want to ground your Rooter so the correct way to do things and not use splitters nice short cable runs make the extra effort to locate the router as close to the Internet as possible it's much easy to run a network cable then it is to run multiple coax cables and on a on a network cable you can happily go 100 meters without losing any performance on the network cable as such but you on a coax cable you've all those performance use high quality cables even on the short runs use the high quality cables it'll make the install much better use as few connectors as possible go ahead antenna placement it's around 6 degrees you want them unobstructed up as high as possible good antennas diction high gain antennas it's what you're after crick grounding so you want to ground your router to an appropriate grounding point so the hd2 dome is the next one next product we're going to look at so the AC dome has integrated cellular antennas within the modem and the return it's all on one device so the it's a simple installation you run a single Ethernet cable between the hd2 dome and wherever you want to have that terminating so you don't need any coaxial cables or anything currently the hd2 dome comes in dual cellular with Kelly for six or 12 modems so that's two modems and each and each device of the same category we also have another version coming out soon which is going to be an HD one category 18 the reason why it's not HD one dome and 7 HD 2 is due to the number of antennas available within the dome there's only 4 engine is available and in a category asing modem must have four antennas the lower antenna is two antennas that adjudicate the lower frequencies and two that are due care for higher frequencies whereas with the previous categories we only needed two antennas per modem so appeared with the hd2 dome you can use the SEM injector so the sim injector is a remote sim injector for the hd2 dome it holds up to 8 some cards and with an HD dome you can obviously place two SIM cards at a time from the sim ejector remotely onto the HD dome so you can mount your dome high up your mast and a hard to access area and then you can physically manage your Sims from below deck the SEM injector also has p OE output so the power for your HT to dome comes from the sim injector there is no need to run a separate power cable for the router just a single network cable nice and simple to install so the next thing I'm gonna cover is the best optimization so this is after you've installed the equipment and you want to get the best out of them so on Lauren L will give you a bit of background on it first there's a fleet of seven vessels that we're sharing a dedicated V set capacity of 35 megabits per second this band was mostly arcade - the two largest yachts for the project we deployed two indexes onto these two largest vessels after the deployment the vessels only - as the V set went cruising out of cellular range this has only got one person at a time so the V set capacity that they shared between the hopefully they reduced down to 20 megabits per second for the rest of the season a one-month reduction and their fee covers the cost of 2mb X's plus the installation plus the cellular data for the whole season that's just from one month reduction in the fee of the V set so this is just showing with the what was happening with the with the fleet so with lauren l the previous summer they were cruising the same areas and they the previous summer used the cellular maybe about 20% of the time because they were in remote areas and it just wasn't capable of the throughputs than here so they set on the beach at the whole time this summer they go cruising the same areas and they coverage nice and I'm just in the time and they barely touched the V set so Steve fusion technology what pip link is doing is bringing all of the services into one easy to manage solution so with the wide range of external future-proof ready devices that you are installing at the moment they will be compatible with these future solutions that we can provide in the cloud base so the kind of solutions we're talking about combining together our fusion some fusion have the SD Wang controller and speak fusion Wang so these will all be combined into one solution so the your client will see it as one solution rather than multiple different technologies so the end client will just benefit from seeing a single fast internet connection wherever they are so huge and some this is another initiative of Kipling fusion some is the capability to remotely put SIM cards on a device anywhere in the world so firstly the Rooter has to have an intent connection so for this one we're using an HT to ip67 router which would have a pre-loaded roaming SIM card in it their work anywhere within the vessels cruising zone so the the Rooter fires up connects the internet using that SIM card it then talks to the speed fusion Clarence's I'm in the Sun so country and I want a SIM card that's a local SIM card so the fusion SIM cloud assuming that there's a SIM card for that country will then remotely give that hd25 p67 a local SIM card that connects to a local network as though that SIM card is installed on that device so this can be done automatically with geographic locations things out there the network is managed care the network is in Australia can select bonding for the bandwidth of the roaming some with the speakers you know it's dual selling modules or you can even switch this fusion zone only save on roaming costs so with this you can have multiple SIM cards available to the vessel that may be lower quantity say 20 gigabytes per SIM card and those SIM cards can be rotated as they hit their their data allowance so you don't go over the data allowance of an individual SIM card so when the device removes to another geographic location the fusion Sun club will automatically select the best SIM card for that device so it can also be known when it reaches usage limits so by geographic location this could be country or it could even be within a single country where you have a zone that you know this particular carrier does not have good coverage so you can create a Geo zone and say I know in that area that that network does not work we cannot get throughput on it and when your fusion some mobile devices go into that area they'll return those some cars the fusions and clout and take in another provider that works better in that area so these are the models that are currently fusions and compatible so we have the hd2 money and the upcoming hardware revision we have the hd2 ip67 from harbor revision 4 and above all of the hd2 domes and the HD to HD one dome when that becomes a veil or all of the UBR series which is a new product which will be coming out soon all of the speed fusion engine and speed fusion engine cams they are all compatible with fusion some so the HD 4 and the HD 2 MV x so only the MV it's not the 8 older HD fours they're all compatible with fusion stone so any of the envy X's that you might have already deployed they will be they are fusions and ready so key takeaways are selecting the right equipment the router trip must be correctly sized for the needs of the plan antennas use high gain antennas for long range and wideband support for different cellular environments you want to steal the equipment the best way possible keeping coaxial cable runs short locating the rooters close to the antennas as possible and grounding the equipment correctly once the equipment's all set up and running you then want to optimize the equipment to deliver the best experience the end user after install the end users is going to use the equipment and that's when they want to see the results so this is using solutions like speed fusion and control fusion simply old all of those kind things which will provide the client with the best possible experience so you should be looking at demoing the MDX cat 18 to all of your clients now the category 18 allows for much higher throughput due to the 4x4 career creation this allows much higher throughput and reliability using the same SIM cards and the same networks so as always you can stay connected with us LinkedIn Facebook YouTube and on the forum please if you're not on the forum get on there there there's a place to go if you've got features feature requests things are there that you really want on the products that's where you need to be for those because you might think out and everyone else might go that's an amazing idea and the more people that talk about it the more likely the engineers to pick up that idea and run with it just room that all the pip link devices that are out there now have been developed due to customer requests so that's how the company is driven on on the development so if you can get the giving of talking about things on the forum they will they'll look into it so we've got a email address now to maritime FK blink calm so anything maritime related any projects you're planning that kind of stuff if you want more info get in contact and we'll help you however we can so now we're going to do Q&A s so we have got a few q and a's here so let me have a look at those okay so we've got one here from Graham what have you done on oil tankers and carrier ships so myself personally my company was focused on soup yachts so I've never I personally haven't done anything on on the commercial side but people in products who he had been used on commercials like this thing that I use a lot on oil rigs and this was like that dredges a whole lot of oil support vessels that kind of stuff they've definitely been used in those kind of areas I can look into some examples of that for you there is there is one an example that is on the case studies on the pitman website which is one of the largest ships in the world a very heavy lifting ship that is they have got an HD I think they've got multiple HD - that have to look at the case though to remember exactly okay so we've got one here from tid so to switch Sims with Fusion Sun would you use geofencing and tags so with Fusion sim so this was I'm assuming this is a fusion Sun cloud you're talking about we can use geofencing and tags the fusion Sun cloud has been built as a very advanced platform and there's lots of functions in there so you can create your own geofencing and and all sorts of rules to decide when and where some cards will be deployed and which devices and so how did I sell the first mbx and well pretty much it sold itself the captain had previously been on another vessel that we had installed in HD for on so here's more than happy to go for the mbx when we talked him throughout his car no you don't you don't you really tell me about this latest and greatest will have it the second one with it went to on ad lib which is the vessel that is featured in in the webinar here what was the savings from the V set to mbx so I won't mention the numbers exactly but these set runs at about two and a half thousand euros per megabit of dedicated bandwidth so you can kind of figure out what kinda numbers we're talking about there for a thirty five megabit connection did the crew get upgraded as well so it depends on the vessels sometimes the crew remain on the beset other times if the cellular data is cheap enough the the boat will pay for local cellular data and shut the V set right down okay so someone's asked about the mbx that was stolen admits yes they were missing on the first night we and we came back the morning it was gone so we've put some tags in on and control and all that kind of stuff and the device hasn't come online yet but we're still waiting and so how many vessels have I seen the ones on that were missed opportunities for a upsell to a larger device that creates a better solution so I'd say on on the super yachts alone that we were dealing with the ninety percent ninety percent the yacht so the overall have a br one on them so what they really should have is a transit duo or a high one even the mbx or even the EPX so the clients that we upgraded from VR ones to transit Joe they instantly still saw the difference when when they were with the new season that's let's see the the improvement more reliable connections things like there so got one here belt the so a customer asked about safety certifications for LPG vessels the ATX certification our approval I will have to check on the hd2 ip67 by do believe it's got its got some certifications but I'll have to double check on that for the LPG vessels were you so the main difference between the HD for IP 67 and the HD for mbx yes so the IP 67 HD 4 can be located outside for better signal that and the HD for IP 67 is lower throughput than the in BX as well the HD for 567 hasn't been upgrade to the in BX throughput of two and a half gigabit year so I'm not sure if there's an in BX version of the IP 67 coming out so that could definitely be a an option so there's one thing is the HD for mbx has much higher throughput and it's upgradeable modems as well whereas the IP 67 ozone okay so there's another question here so does pickling have any maritime specific training so we're actually in the process of creating a marine engineer certification so this will allow your engineers to showcase the specialized skills in the maritime industry so this will be kind of like the existing PC piping certified engineers and peopling surfers sales specialists except for we specialized for the maritime industry will we be able to see a recording of the river yes your if you've missed any part of their webinar we're gonna send out a link to the slides and the recording in about one or two days so you'll be able to view that then so for the availability of the antenna 107 and the HD one dome I will have to double check on the exact available dates for them if you send us an email we can follow up on that okay there's anyone else have any more questions so Richards just asked it is a radiation pattern available for the antenna 107 I believe there is I will double-check with Cassie and I will get that over here Richard okay well thank you around for attending and we are going to wrap it up there we will be doing more maritime specific webinars in the future so if you've got anything that you'd like focused on case studies things like that let us know and we'll see if we can incorporate them and the and the next webinar thank you"}

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "hello everyone thank you for joining we're gonna get our webinar started here my name is Travis Derek I'm a product manager at Peplink and today we're gonna talk about all the cool new things in router firmware 8.0 point one which was released just a couple weeks ago and in control version two point eight point two there's all kinds of new stuff in both of these so excited to show you guys what's some of my favorites are so first up we're gonna talk about router firmware eight point zero point one again this was just released about two weeks ago I think we're kind of under selling it by calling it a zero point one release but I don't get to choose the version numbers on the firmware so I'll just dive in and show you what I think is so great about it and why it might be a little bit bigger than a zero point one release so first up is our layer seven dpi so we've done a couple things in this version 8.0 point one number one we've expanded the application signatures we've just about doubled them so there's all kinds of new applications on our QoS and filtering lists we've also synchronized all those lists into all the different places in the router that you use them so that same DPI engine is running our layer seven firewall capabilities and it's also the same engine running our QoS capabilities so there's a few different places where you'll see these new applications show up speaking of those new applications lots of popular ones like YouTube Netflix whatsapp Google Drive onedrive all these really popular cloud applications that all of our customers are using already and so here's just a quick little glimpse of what the difference is between the number of applications supported in our dpi signatures on the Left we've got the eight point zero point zero list from the layer seven firewall so you can see like if we look at that first category audio video streaming there's a handful of maybe two handfuls worth of services in there if you look on the right-hand side that's the eight point zero point one list you can see just that that real-time streaming audio video list is pretty much doubled you see much more popular applications like Netflix Pandora YouTube's listed in there now as well so again lots of relevant applications have been added to the DPI signatures we only have enough real estate on one screen to show you the two lists the list go on on both of them but again I encourage you to dive into those and just see how many new applications there are in there and the good news is we're not done there we know there's lots more applications that you folks want to see added that are important to your customers and so after this sir after this webinar is done we're gonna send out a survey for you guys to help weigh in on what other applications you guys want to see show up in our dpi signatures so definitely not done here but wanted to show you all the great enhancements that have happened already so another huge feature this is applying to the fusion hub is we've supported layer 2 speed fusion infusion hub now an eight point zero point one this is something that customers have been asking for for a long time and it's not that we haven't been listening but it's complicated to do in the in the fusion hub world but nonetheless eight point zero point one we finally delivered on that and it's pretty incredible how they've implemented this if you guys remember in firmware 8 point zero point zero we introduced V RFS in fusion hub which are separate isolated routing functions that allows you to have different customers with overlapping subnets on the same fusion hub well now with layer 2 support in fusion hub you can have a unique layer 2 environment in each VRS so you could have five different completely isolated layer two environments so you can have multiple customers in the same fusion hub each with their own private layer 2 and layer 3 speed fusion environments so this really opens up a lot of options for what you can do with a single fusion hub in terms of multi-tenancy and all kinds of unique networking combinations that you can build now easily from fusion hub so I'll show you how to how to get to those settings here in the router GUI in this screenshot we've got the speed fusion page of a fusion hub so configuring this is a little different than configuring layer to speed fusion on the router side normally on the router side you have to go to the LAN interface and and set a VLAN to be a layer to speed fusion profile in the fusion hub world you go to the bottom of that speed fusion page where you see the pet VPN settings you click on that question mark there you'll see there's a an option to define a layer to bridging pet VPN so when you click on that link inside of there you see this new menu show up at the bottom and this lets you select the different profiles that you've got in your in your fusion hub so if you've got three different profiles for three different locations you can add each of those to the drop down here just select them one at a time and click the plus and then it will effectively bridge all three of those profiles so you can choose which profiles to bridge and you can also optionally bridge them to the LAN interface of your fusion hub so if you've got an application that lives in the cloud in the same LAN segment as your fusion hub you can bridge those remote peers to than whatever applications are on that LAN segment in your fusion hub as well again just gives you lots of flexibility next up is a popular security feature that people have been asking for for a long time and that's country based firewalls and outbound policies so that you can control which countries traffic and come in from traffic can go out to or you could steer traffic destined for a certain country down a certain way and if you live in an area where certain providers are better at terminating traffic to this region or that region you've got the ability to control that with outbound policies and again firewalls you can control kind of who you can talk to and what parts of the world this is all managed with I see too so you're not going to see these features directly in the router GUI you're gonna have to go into ic2 and manage the firewall that knob on policies there we'll show you some of those screenshots a little bit later when we talk about the ICT side of that feature so another one that's been talked about for a while and it's been slowly rolling out is fast roaming support or seamless roaming on wife so this first started with the access point firmware 3.60 recently there's a new firmware 36.1 which adds support for a couple different seamless roaming extensions of 802 11 so we're now supporting 802 11 K R and V those are all roaming related extensions of 802 11 so that's all supported now in that ap form or 3 to 6.1 and then in the router firmware eight dot zero dot one you're able to configure that from the AP controller so you can push that out and scale from the ap controller now in 8:01 so if we look at that from the AP controller side you can see here we're setting up a wwp a two personal network we've populated a shared key and then we've checked this fast transition box previously in the older 36.0 we only supported 802 11 are roaming extension but again now in 3.6.13 our K and V so very much on par with what a lot of the other enterprise Wi-Fi vendors support in terms of seamless roaming capabilities another cool feature in 8 0.1 is scheduled sim switching so now you've got the ability to choose based on a calendar date and time when you want to switch between sim a and Symbian or router there's lots of different motivations for doing this sometimes you've got data plans that you need to make sure that you've got usage in every month sometimes you need to make sure that you're not using a sim card too long and every month there's lots of different business reasons and data plan reasons why you might want to do this but nonetheless that's a new feature in 8:01 so here you can see in one of our cellular interfaces there's the usual suspects that you normally get to choose between sim a and cindy but now we've got this alternate periodically between sim a and B and so when you choose that button you can see it gives you a time and a date of the month that you can set that sim switch to happen so again really nice simple feature but for some customers it's a really big deal so the last feature I'm gonna talk about in 8:01 is more of a bug fix not as fun of an item to talk about but nonetheless there was a bug in seven one one and eight zero zero that would degrade the speed fusion bonding performance more often when cellular links were in play but regardless in eight zero one we've squashed that bug so anybody doing cellular bonding we highly encourage you to upgrade all of your endpoints to eight zero one so that would apply to fusion hub and the routers themselves to avoid that bonding performance bug you'll want to get every end of that speed fusion network up on e at zero one as soon as possible okay with that we'll dive into all the new cool features in in control two point eight point two I see two two point eight point two has been out for about a month now so a little bit longer than eight zero one firmware but nonetheless we want to get you guys familiar with all those changes that showed up in there so the first big one in IC two two point eight point two is the firewall management features we've had firewall management capabilities in IC two for about a year but in two point eight point two we've made it a lot more flexible and easy to administer from the cloud previously you had to upload a firewall config kicked out of a router and if you wanted to update that you had to go reconfigure it in the router and then re-upload that file well now now you can start from scratch and build your firewall policies directly in IC - you can still upload a config from a router if you've got a template that you want to start with but now you can edit that directly in IC - as well so you can add rules change the order of them edit them you've got all the flexibility to manage those rules directly from IC to now so a lot more easier to administer day-to-day here you can see an example of that country or region blocking that we talked about earlier as well here we've set up an inbound firewall rule that I'm saying is to allow North American traffic so I've said allow any traffic from a region being the United States or Canada and again I'm going to allow that traffic my default firewall policy would be to deny so effectively I'm only allowing traffic that's originating from the US or Canada to come into my network so again you can do this on the firewall policies or the outbound policies you can use this region blocking capability now so talking about outbound policies in ic2 this gets a similar update to what the firewall policies did again before you had to upload a config file that had your outbound policies in it and you didn't have a lot of ability to modify those on-the-fly after you'd uploaded it so those changes have been extended to the up on policy manager as well and again here you can see on the Left we've got a few of the different options that are showing up in the destination or source view now see again you've got that region capability for the country blocking there's also a new one called SAS software as a service and so what this is doing this is giving you first packet inspection on right now originally just two services that are popular so we've got all the Google G suite services in there and then we've got all the Microsoft Office 365 and Azure services in there so if you've got traffic that you know is destined for one of those two services you can quickly identify that here using that SAS destination and then choosing G suite or the Microsoft Office 365 traffic as well so that that's another popular feature that's going to be expanded on as we as we get more feedback from you guys on what what applications you want those first packet definitions for but again we've got those rolled out now an eight zero one to start playing with and learn how to take advantage of that capability another new feature in ic2 is one that's been in the router GUI for a little while now and that's called group networks in eight point zero point zero we added this feature into the router firmware so that you could add a list of several different IP addresses or subnets and create that into what's call the group network so that you could use that groups network in your out policies and your firewall rules so you've got only got to go to one place to manage that list of IP so let's say you have 10 different offices each with a firewall and so you can put a whole list of all of those offices firewalls and IP addresses in this group network list and then you can create really simple policies so you can whitelist any traffic coming from your other offices automatically so again you've got one list to maintain instead of having to go to every single router at every location and update if an IP changes or you add an office here or there you can really quickly manage those those lists of networks or ip's at scale another big update on ic2 is the speed fusion configurator there's been a few different fine-tuning settings in the speed fusion router GUI that haven't shown up in ic2 yet and so now two point eight point two is exposing a lot of those extra settings so that includes latency difference cut off suspension time after packet loss these are all kind of nitty-gritty speed fusion settings that are used to optimize performance depending on your Wan links so bonding cellular is one area where these these finer tuning settings can really really impact your performance in a big way other highlights here that have been added to the speed fusion configurator layer to speed fusion configuration is now supported here and we've also added support for forward air Corrections so we're we're getting much closer to parity on the ic2 settings vs. the router GUI settings so that you can use all these powerful new updates to speed fusion with the with the easy of ease of management of ic2 so earlier we talked about the seamless roaming or fast transition option in the new AP firmware and that also has been added to the in control side so now if you've got in control managed SS IDs you can quickly enable that fast transition or seamless roaming and push that out to all of your different routers out there so that you can enable that feature whether you're using the AP controller or ic2 to manage those those SSID networks another cool one is an update to a feature that I think most people didn't know was there in the first place and so I really wanted to highlight this one previously ic2 allowed you to add a substring with the wild-card hash hash hash hash or pound pound pound pound and that would add the last four digits of the routers serial number to whatever SSID you configured so a lot of times service providers like to do this so that they can provide a similar but unique SSID to all of their different customers routers the updated an IC to two point eight point two is you can put that wildcard substring in anywhere in the SSID previously it had to be on the end now you can put it anywhere additionally you can randomize the shared key for these SS IDs that you have so you can really quickly at large scale create nice unique service provider style SS IDs for all of your customers so that they've got nice secure common-sense access to their their SSID their Wi-Fi networks so one more service that I wanted to show you guys this one actually didn't get an update in two point eight point two but it's one that's kind of surrounded by a lot of mysteries sometimes it might not have the most intuitive name that's our find my Peplink service so what this is is this is a dynamic DNS service so it allows you to create a hostname for any of your routers so that you can very quickly find that using a common sense hostname instead of remembering a whole bunch of P addresses this is super useful for speed fusion so if you've got a speed fusion router with public IPS that might be too dynamic you can give them a find my Peplink address and use those when you're building your speed fusion profiles instead of having to find the IPS and update it if it changes I c2 will do all that automatically for you to get into that you have to go to the device level click on the Edit link right under the device name and when you do that you'll see a bunch of options show up just below the map there you'll see find my Peplink service you turn that on and then you can give it whatever hostname prefix you want just make sure you save that at the bottom and as soon as you as soon as that's done you should be able to ping that that hostname that you've got and start using that dynamic DNS service there's no extra cost to it it's just part of your ic2 subscription so definitely encourage you guys to take advantage of that feature another feature that's been in IC 2 for a few versions but got a subtle update here but nonetheless is a super powerful one that I want to make sure you guys are aware of there's our SIM card reports so previously this was labeled as simple reports but what it does is it lets you create reports at the organization level for all of your groups or at the group level or both but what it does is we automatically track the carrier for each SIM card in all of your equipment and we allow you to build reports based on that so you can by default look at all the usage for each carrier look at how many sim cards you have you can set your billing start days if you if you want you can send pooled alerts so that if you're going over whatever your data plan might be you can get an alert on that then you can also create custom pools so you can create a custom pool for customers that might have SIM cards from four different carriers that you're creating a unique data plan for you can put those custom pools in there and also build on those alerting reports for that so again very powerful feature just go in there and explore it it's under the reports tab again it's at the group level it's at the organization level so you can set it at each different level for whatever internal or external purpose you're trying to report on so the last feature in ic2 that I want to talk about is a fairly subtle one but again really powerful when you when you're managing networks at scale so our cellular products the max routers have cellular LTE modules inside of them and those those modules have their own module level firmware separate from the router firmware that we produce and not very often but from time to time there can be bugs in that module firmware or the the network carrier might have an update that they require a newer module firmware for so from time to time there's a need to upgrade all of your cellular radio modules and we've got the option in the GUI to do that individually but again if you've got five hundred five thousand devices out there that's not an easy thing to go through and click into each GUI and so now we've added the ability to do this from ic2 so you can you can search you can click that edit button you can check as many devices as you is you want to update the firmware on and then choose that actions drop-down and choose to update the cellular module firmware so again just another great way to manage you devices at scale for those tasks that might not come up as often as as you expect but when they do come up they're usually pretty urgent to get done so that's all I've got for the content I'll just go through and start reviewing some of the questions feel free to submit more questions to me right now as I'm as I'm reading through this and I can answer any any questions you've got on these new features ok so the first question I see is asking about the a p1 300m to see if that's gonna support faster roaming I'll have to get a specific answer on the fast roaming part but I do know that there is an updated firmware being worked on for the 300m it's kind of been the last to get updated as the newer AC and the wave 2 products have been coming out but nonetheless we are we are actively working on a new firmware for the 300m I'll have to go back with engineering and just confirm if the seamless roaming features specifically will make it to that firm one or not so I see another question about the I see two only features like the IP groups or the firewall level or the country level firewall rules so that IP groups are available in the router right now that's in I believe eight zero zero but definitely an eight zero one you can see the the group networks feature in there the country blocking I don't know if that will show up there's kind of active maintenance required on those country lists and so I think that one is going to be harder to actually push down to the router level I've got another question about the country based routing I'm looking for more in additional information on that I'll look and see if we've got a FAQ on the forum and if not we'll make sure to post one about that feature specifically and how you can use it I see another question about the DPI list can we manage bandwidth per application so this is something we've heard quite a bit like I want to limit I don't want to block Netflix but I want to limit it to 10 Meg's no more than 10 Meg's per second so that's one example I've heard quite a few times that's not in 8:01 but that is something that engineering has committed to working on and so I'm not sure if that will make the next firmware version or not but we were just discussing that capability earlier this week and they've they've said it's definitely possible and they're committed to implementing that and so I would stay tuned for that I think there's a good chance we'll see that coming out in the next firmware version but I'm not a hundred percent sure if it'll make that or not but definitely being worked on so the SAS office 365 does that include Skype and team if it's a Microsoft registered IP address it certainly should were Microsoft and Google published their their public facing service IPs and so were we're listening to those published services and automatically updating them as they update those IP so I'm not positive if that services included but it seems unlikely that Microsoft would exclude those IPS from their from their globally published IP list okay I see two other questions can dpi work per client I'm not exactly sure what the question is asking there the DPI identifies the applications being used so you can prioritize or block those applications you can create different user groups so that some have different QoS policies each group has different QoS policies or maybe is exempt from some of the application blocking that other clients might be so hopefully that helps answer your question but if not just throw another question in the end of the mix here another question on BGP on speed fusion hub I'm not positive on that one that one will definitely depend on where your fusion hub is deployed like VMware versus versus a cloud service but that's something I can definitely follow up on and get get an answer for you David I see a question on testing of the fast roaming I'm not sure how engineering tested that but I know they've implemented those 802 11 fast roaming standards and so I'm not sure exactly what what they're testing was but I can say I was on a long conference call last night at my house and I definitely roamed between APs walking from from the upstairs to the downstairs a couple times during that call on a Skype call I did not have a single drop or skipping audio during that during those transitions so from my real-world test case it worked very well in my in my home so I see another question about the sass not showing up in the web GUI that's another one that we're actively listening to updates from those cloud providers and so there's a kind of an update component to that and so that's why those features have been implemented in IC 2 I'm not sure if there's an easy way to extend that directly into the router level or not for now it's a feature that will live in IC 2 only but definitely open to feedback from you guys as you as you get in there and use it and get more comfortable with it ok I'll give another minute or so for questions to show up if not I think we'll give you guys back a half hour a little bit shorter webinar than normal today but I think it should be helpful for you guys to see all these new features and dive in there and I would definitely encourage you to post questions up in the forum as you start exploring these new features all right with that we'll shut down the webinar for today thank you all very much for

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "hello everyone and welcome to this video showing care Peplink and pep wave speed fusion tunnels can be created we're going to demonstrate for you how to create a basic tunnel we're going to show how easy it is to add bonding and then we're going to show some troubleshooting steps that you can take when things aren't working as expected and we're going to show how the locks and status screens can help with this troubleshooting in order to do this I've created a simple lab environment which will allow us to easily show how this works so we have a fusion pub running on vmware which is able to get out to the internet via an acid firewall then there's a pep wave HD for mbx which will be given with a single 35 make one connection which is directly reachable to the fusion hub due to them being on the same layer to network will create a tunnel between the fusion hub and the mbx in the first instance moving on from that one will then add a second 35 Meg connection to show how easy is to bring bonding to the solution finally we will add a cellular connection to the device this will mean that the tunnel has to be connected to the fusion of via the firewall and we will talk about the steps that are required to make that work so this is the two devices that are going to be used for the demonstration on the left is the fusion up and on the right the mbx the fusion hub is going to use to the head end device and connect it to you by the MDX to create the tunnel and we'll start by going to the speed fusion page on each device on each device we'll create a new profile for the fusion hub we'll give it a name and the remote ID the remote IDs the local ID of the mbx we could add an additional password here but for this demo we will leave it blank on the mbx we will also add a name and the remote ID which is the local idea of the fusion hub we will also need to set the remote IP which is the fusion hubs when I pee at this point make sure to apply all the changes and if the settings are correct the tunnel will establish itself on the dashboard you'll see that the tunnel status becomes visible on each device clicking on the status button next to the speed fusion tunnel will show further details and allow you to see the connection status within the tunnel so on the left screen now we're going to show the dashboard of the MDX and we're going to now add the second wine connection to the MDX once the cable is connected to the MU X it will begin testing the one to confirm that is working using the health check once this is complete the connection is marked as being up the speed fusion tunnel will then test the connection to make sure it's capable of being used in the tunnel and if it is it will then add the connection to the tunnel its status will be shown in the right on screen on this data screen clicking the greater-than button takes you to the pet VPN test tool where you can perform speed tests see the one status and the remote one status within the tunnel you can turn off each of the ones within the tunnel temporarily to relate to confirm how the tunnel will perform if a certain connection gets disconnected as you can see in this test the two links give a combined upload speed of around 60 to make per second when bonded and 30 to make per second each the ability to disable the Wayne connections in this screen is temporary and they will automatically reconnect after 50 minutes if you forget to reenable them at the same time the test will affect the tunnel performance for any users though use in the connection so care is advised when using this tool we have now inserted a sim card into the ambient cellular port 1 but while that establishes will show you at all which been added to firmware 8 which allows you to do a point-to-point speed test between two Pampling devices this is called the while analyzer and can be found under the system tab on each device we will tell one device to be the server and then configure the other device to the client the tool can be really useful for confirming the connection speeds that you are seeing in the speed fusion tunnel as the advertised speed of the one is rarely achievable due to factors such as latency distance and ISP congestion you are able to test the various connections in any combinations that you choose and then easily see the amount of bandwidth is available between the two devices you so returning to the dashboard of each device we can now see that the cellular connection is active on the mdx visiting the speed fusion status screen shows that a connection isn't added to the tunnel and that it isn't able to use the connection to send a received data this is shown in the cellular one link status the reason for this is that doesn't know a route to get to the fusion hub due to only knowing the private IP address of the fusion at one the firewall also needs ports forwarded to the fusion hub to work as the default ports are currently in use we have configured custom ports on the firewall which are forwarded on the fusion hub on the fusion hub we'll all set the receiving handshake port for all the speed fusion tunnels by setting it here and saving it using the Save button directly below then for the profile we'll set the custom data port for the tunnel on the fusion hub side we'll save and apply those settings on the mbx we will then add the remote handshake port to the pet VPN profile and add the external IP on this side the data port can be left default as well as the receiving handshake as both these will be inbound to the fusion hub save and apply these settings and then we will wait with the tunnel to re-establish you can click the show all profiles to actually see tunnels that aren't connected you if the settings are correct and the cellular connection will be used for the tunnel see that states updating now running the pet VPN test on this will also show that traffic is passing over the cellular connection along with the other wine connections you now we would like to show you what happens when the settings are incorrect and what messages and status screens will show you to help find the course of an issue we will start by setting an incorrect remote ID on the MDX you this caused the tunnel to be stuck in starting you checking the event log reveals the following message which states the remote ID or pre shared key is incorrect nothing is shown on the fusion upside you we'll then correct the remote ID and we'll set in correct data port you again the tunnel gets stuck in starting although you're often see the device authenticate and then start creating the tunnel only to fail and cycle through it again you the event log will show you that the device failed to connect to the remote peer if the settings were correct on the Peplink device there is to indicate that something is blocking the traffic between the peers finally set in the data port remote ID to the correct setting and removing the external IP will add the tunnel to connect but not the cellular this status will be shown under the speed fusion status screen as a link failure you so that's the end of this video please look out for more videos which are coming soon where we will show some of the more advanced features of pet VPN and speed fusion such as using one smoothing forward error correction and more thanks very much for watching [Music]"}

dome as you can see by the Green status lights on the dome now in the sim ejector I'm using two sims slot 1 and slot 3 as indicated by the green LEDs on the front of the sim injector now let's login to our dome again and see how we configure the hd2 dome to use those for most Sims it's worth mentioning that at the moment this feature is only available with special booth firmware 7.1 one special build one three seven now we're clicking on the details tab on cellular module one and we're going to use remote sim only here we enter the serial number of the sim injector scroll down and we'll save and apply that change we're going to repeat this on senator model to use remote sim only enter the serial number but this time we're going to force it to use symmetry only while putting a colon and then the number three after this serial number now we'll save and apply this again and now this takes a moment or two for the sims to be detected and then to establish a connection so I'm just going to speed this up save you having to wait for this to happen if your sims do not connect automatically and you need to create APN settings click on the Advanced tab and down to a remote limit management here we have Auto land discovery if you're at sim ejector is not shown you can click on the icon here and either scan for it if it's not shown you can UNASUR enter the serial number up manually here we have a list of remote sim service because you might have more than one and here we configure the sims for each sim at server you can select this sim slot you can name the slot if you desire and click on custom mobile operator settings to enter the appropriate APN username and password and if necessary enter the SIM PIN okay then we're going to have a quick look at the sim injectors GUI itself but first of all we need to know the IP address so click on the Status tab client list obviously this is going to list all of the clients associated to the dome on Army's 50 in the same injector and I'm going to now open a new tab and go to the appropriate IP address logging in with admin and admin again both lower case the dashboard gives us an overview of our sim ejector clicking on the Sims tab we can see that we have eight slots two of which are being used clients this gives you the serial number of our HT to dump and POA this allows you to enable or disable the p OE on each port settings this is basically our network settings you can reset you back to factory default clicking on reset or you can upgrade the firmware click the upgrade firmware button or you can manually upload the firmware file yourself now let's have a look at one or two of our mounting options for our HT to don't first of all we have our HD two ton installed here on the roof perhaps of our vehicle they we have a cable coming down to the Ethernet ports this could be a hundred meters worth of p OE capable cable [Music] connecting the ethernet back to the underside of the dome you could wall mount it using the bracket shown alternatively you could make the domes onto a pole using this adapter which screws onto the side of the Ethernet ports with that in place slide the pole through here and clamp it in place using the brackets and nuts supplied look thank you very much for watching enjoy your hd2 don't"}

["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"]}, "recordingDetails": {}, "transcript": "hello my name is Peter West with West networks and today I'm gonna talk about the new 16 port DC switch from Peplink but specifically talked about its amazing feature called a bland and bypass Peplink routers have had the LAN bypass feature for a while now and I demonstrated that in my drop-in mode video where we actually unplug the power to the router and showed that another firewall would still have internet even though the power to the router was off and we're gonna demonstrate that today and the 16 port switch so let's talk about the 16 port switch for just a little bit go over its features and then we're gonna demonstrate LAN bypass this is the new 16 port switch it's actually a 17 port switch so we have eight p OE or p OE plus ports we have sixteen gigabit ethernet ports port 16 and SP one share a port so they cannot be used at the same time it's an either/or then you have the one gigabit SFP port number two total you have 17 ports on the back hand side we have our console port our management port we have a USB port for out-of-band management I actually was doing an install of these in Tampa and we needed to get into these switches and change some of the set s FP settings and so I plugged in a USB modem here got them on in control change the settings unplug the modem and the switches got online you have two inputs for power so if you have one of them you're gonna 120 watts if you have two of them you're gonna have 240 watts and that's where you get to 240 watts of total p OE plus power and then you have a DC block input that's going to be 12 256 volt this switch in particular not our other switches has a feature called LAN bypass and the idea is you can daisy-chain the switches and if a switch goes offline it doesn't affect switches following the line so I'm gonna demonstrate LAN bypass today this switch it has this phone it's then plugged into this switch this switch is plugged into this switch this switch is plugged to our router and our New Balance 30 Pro router actually if you look at my the screen I do not have power and my switch 3 has already come online was at point of this video but got funny there's two use cases that I see kind of really need on this imagine a train set up right here and you have your engine and you have compartments and each of these compartments you need to have wireless ApS and you need to have security cameras and so you can have these and if power goes out to one of the compartments you don't want the security cameras and Wi-Fi to go out in the other trailing compartments and so that's sort of the idea here and so tough to demo this out we're gonna establish a voice over IP phone call we're going to unplug the switch this voice over IP phone call will not get interrupted it will go quiet while the switch converts from power mode to bypass mode but we won't drop the phone call and that's what's important sessions might suspend for a few seconds but we're not gonna drop any sessions and we're not gonna affect any trailing areas and I'll be able to unplug both of these switches and have this with this phone still working the other use case that I see for this would be a cubicle environment so say you have your router and your main switch is set up over here you can have a cubicle stack here a cubicle stack here at cubicle stack here have five phones plugged into each one of these and then by daisy chaining if the power goes out in the middle cubicle these phones and these phones aren't affected by that and that's sort of the idea is that you can create this more reliable Network when your daisy chaining switches so I should see now that all of my switches are in line so I have my Gainesville Florida balance 30 Pro I have switch 1 switch 2 and switch 3 all online and connected so I'm going to go ahead and establish a phone call hey amber this is Peter I'm demonstrating land bypass mode so I'm gonna count to 15 and then at 3 I'm gonna unplug the switch and so amber is gonna tell me when we come back on line one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen amber are you still there okay so we lost four seconds while we transitioned from power mode to bypass mode but the phone call never dropped and that's the whole idea here is that you can have this extra bit of redundancy you're not rushing to switch the the network cables or bypass a switch in the event that one switch gets turned off so it adds a little bit of resiliency and redundancy but but at the same time maintain session persistence on that call and that's sort of the idea behind LAN bypass and the new Peplink 16 port switch thank you very much and have a great day thank you amber [Music] you"}

"transcript": "hello my name is Peter West with West networks and today I'm going to demonstrate drop in mode on the Peplink balance routers drop in mode allows you to add multiple internet connections to an existing infrastructure ok so what we currently have is the ISP handing a static IP address to our Sophos UTM and then the so post UTM is connected to our land and you can see here here's my ISP handoff we have 98 187 228 dot 78 / 29 that's our demo Cox IP address but what's important here is the default gateway the default gateway is 98 187 228 that one 77 and what what that means is the Sophos is talking to the Gateway and in order to add a Peplink router and drop-in mode we're not going to change anything on the Sophos what we're going to do is we're gonna put the Peplink router in place we're gonna program it with an additional static IP so let's go ahead and do that so I have a Peplink router it's online via in control with a LTE modem plugged into an one this way I can program the router without it being connected to the to the network so I'm gonna go to the network settings and I'm gonna enable drop-in mode so I'm gonna go to my network settings drop-in mode settings I'm going to check this box land one with bypass and once again I'm gonna put this default gateway in there dot 77 oh sorry seventy-nine name-dropping mode daddy daddy daddy I'm gonna have DHCP disabled it's safe so there's my drop-in mode settings and I go to my way in and that's the whole point of doing drop-in mode with a Peplink router is to be able to have that backup so we're gonna do a backup LTE I'm gonna program this for 10 megabits per second just so it doesn't go overkill I'm gonna hit save and you'll see my dropping mode there and I'm gonna enable my way in to which is my backup internet connection so now that my way my two hands have been programmed I'm gonna hit apply changes we're gonna install the so the Peplink router here some hit apply we're gonna bring the Peplink router in place right here and so now you have the Peplink router with its backup internet connection and remember we had the backup internet connection as ISP number two and then so so LAN here's my land port that's going to go to the Sophos and then here's my land port so I'm going to move the Sophos from LAN port internet port to the Peplink and then i'm gonna plug the Peplink into the Sophos internet port and once again i've never made a single change to the Sophos and so now the Peplink is getting an IP address public static IP it's then passing and drop in mode to the Sophos but now i can add two additional internet connections to the to the Sophos so you'll see that I'm in drop-in mode you can see my IP is online my LTE is online and I have the router so I'm gonna make one quick outbound change just to make this a little bit faster for demonstration purposes so I'm gonna tell it to prioritize the traffic over the drop in mode circuit this will allow the LTE because the LTE is kind of slower than a high-speed Internet connection to second so I'm doing drop-in mode primary then then use LTE only if the primary circuit is not available Elmen hit apply changes and so now I'm gonna start a ping a constant ping to Google and you can see that it's pinging now when I failover this is not bonding so there will be some drop packets but the idea is to show that when the Internet crashes or goes down that it will fail over so so the first thing we do is I'm gonna unplug my internet connection so I unplug my wanne one internet connection and what's gonna happen is the router is gonna see that when one failed and it's going to start rerouting the traffic over the LTE circuit so I've unplugged the when one so now I'm going to plug win one back in so that the internet starts working over that's that connection again and once again when it fails back it's going to drop that connection and fell back over to to the cable provider and then it's filled back over to the cable provider now let's assume that the balance router crashes which it would never happen but if it does we're gonna unplug the power to the balance router now there's no power going to this router the Peplink is still plugged in or the Sophos is plugged into the Peplink I lost one packet so drop in mode with LAN bypass allows that this connection to the cable provider to work and I'm gonna show you that that is actually the case because I'm gonna unplug the cable provider here and now we've lost Internet connectivity so it is in fact land bypassing the connection I can plug this back in and my traffic starts slowing again so the Peplink balance router and drop-in mode allows us to add additional circuits to an existing firewall configuration without making any changes to your LAN or way in architecture but allows you to add additional circuits further it adds protection by having bypass mode that in the event that the pout router is off that you don't lose your primary circuit I hope you found this information valuable and that using the demonstration you would be able to set this up yourself if you need any help please feel free to reach out to Peplink any time and have a great day take 11 I hope you found this information take 12 I hope you found this information take 13 I hope you found this information something valuable yeah okay sorry take 14 you"}

It all happened quite by accident, back in August of last year when\nwe strapped a GoPro to a motorbike helmet and created a fun real life version of a first\nperson shooter computer game and started streaming it to strangers on the Internet allowing them\nto take control of the game. It all got a little bit out of hand and ended up getting\n6 million views in the first three days and it gave birth to this new format which we're\nnow running with and seeing how deep the rabbit hole goes. But after Level 1, we knew we had\nto step it up a few notches and a big part of that.. a big part of the game is the location\nthat we find. So recently with Level 2 we went to Fawley Power station which is a big\nabandoned industrial site in South Hampton and also more recently in a disused mansion\nhere in Devon. Both of which provide some quite specific connectivity problems. Here\nin the studio where we shot Level 1, we had fixed line broadband which was fine, it did\nthe job perfectly. But in both of these other locations we had no fixed line, we didn't\neven have any neighbours with fixed line connectivity which obviously for something like this, Internet\nconnectivity is absolutely vital to what we do. So we started looking at satellite, which\nwas never going to work because although it's reliable, it's expensive which is a big problem\nbut one we can get around, but what we can't get around is the latency. When you're controlling\na game remotely you need to feel responsive and quick and that means we've got to drop\nthat latency right down. So we hit Google on how we're going to solve this problem.\nAnd the name that kept coming up was Peplink and something specifically called Sofware\nDefined WAN which allowed us to take multiple 3G and 4G connections, bond them together\nto get something with the highest possible bandwidth and with the most reliability and\nlowest latency. So we got in touch with Peplink, we said hey can you help us? They said yup!\nThis is exactly what it's designed to do and they actually put us in touch with a local\nservice provider and they're called Grapevine Connect. Who then supported us through both the other\nshoots, which was really cool...basically they turn up on one of the build days of the\nshoot and are just there in the background doing a site survey figuring out where the\nbest most reliable connectivity is. They install the hardware and they just give us the lines\nsaying OK here's your Internet, it's just going to work. It sounds that it should be\nmore complicated than that and I'm sure it is but to us as the end user it's what we\nget: we get a line, we plug it into our system and we have full Internet access. And so this\nsystem as well as being incredibly reliable, it's also remotely managed so that whole Software\nDefined WAN is actually dealt with by Grapevine Connect remotely, the whole time we're dealing\nwith it, they're there behind the scenes tweaking things and just making sure everything's running\nas smoothly as possible. Which is huge for us because it means we've got everything we\nneed- we've got reliability, we've got high bandwidth, we've got low latency, and most\nimportantly that means we're now confident in pitching new jobs and going out into new\nlocations and finding these awesome, beautiful hardcore locations to film these interactive\ngames knowing that we've got a team behind this that can come in and give us reliable\nhigh quality Internet, wherever the game and the format takes us."}

Depending on the model, the Peplink Balance\nallows you to configure as many as 500 AP One access points with just a few clicks. In our example, we'll be setting up four access\npoints in an office with two floors. On the first floor, we have a single AP One\nfor guests and staff, and we've installed three AP Ones for staff and management working\non the second floor. As you'll see in the upcoming five-part demonstration,\nthe Peplink Balance WLAN Controller makes it easy to set up and control a network perfectly\ntailored to your customers and employees. To start, select the Network tab on the top\nmenu. Next, click AP Management, located in the\nWLAN Controller section at the left side of your screen. To turn on AP management, check Enable. To manage an AP One installed on a remote\nnetwork, check Manage Remote AP. You can also set up a list of recognized AP\nOne devices. To do that, click Access Points Listed Below\nand enter each device's serial number. To store your changes, click the Save button. Then, make your changes active by clicking\nApply Changes. Next, you'll see the Dashboard page, which\ndisplays a list of all automatically discovered AP One devices on your network. Now that we’ve enabled and detected all\nAP Ones on the network, it's time to create and configure separate wireless networks for\nguests, staff, and management. To get started, select the Network tab from\nthe top menu. Next, click Wireless Networks. Then, click the New Network button. In our example, we’ve already created wireless\nnetworks for our managers and staff. Now we’ll create a network just for guests. In the Wireless Network Settings section,\nenter a network name. We'll call ours \"Guest,\" though you can use\nany name you'd like. The Security Policy menu features WPA/WPA2\n-- Personal encryption, which we’ve used to protect our staff and manager networks. For larger businesses using external password\nauthentication servers, there’s also WPA/WPA2 -- Enterprise security. Though we recommend password-protecting most\nnetworks, our guests should be able to access the Internet without entering a password. In this case, we’ll select Open from the\nSecurity Policy dropdown menu. Then, we’ll tweak our network’s advanced\nsettings to provide a greater measure of security while still making it easy for our guests\nto get online. To prevent guests from accessing our local\nserver, we'll check Block All Private IP in the Guest Protect section. If you'd like to manage bandwidth usage in\nyour networks, you can set bandwidth and user limits in the Bandwidth Management section. By checking Captive Portal, you can display\ncustom splash screens to your Wi-Fi users. This is a great feature for building your\nbrand and ensuring that users of your public Wi-Fi networks have accepted your terms and\nconditions. When you’re happy with your new wireless\nnetwork settings, click OK to create the network. With all our networks properly configured,\nwe'll click Apply Changes to make our changes active. Now that we've successfully created and configured\nour wireless networks, let’s move on to creating access point profiles. AP profiles allow us to combine and configure\nwireless networks, as well as letting us assign various networks to specific AP One devices. In our example,our first floor AP One should\nhave separate profiles for guests and staff. We'll start by selecting the Network tab and\nclicking the AP Profiles link. Next,we'll click the New AP Profile button. Let's call our new AP profile \"1st Floor.\" Each AP profile can include up to four wireless\nnetworks, though we'll need just two in our example -- one for guests and another for\nstaff. In your AP profiles, you can optimize your\nAP One's radio performance using the options in the Wi-Fi AP Advanced Settings section. You might, for example, select a different\n2.4 GHz radio channel to eliminate potential channel conflicts and boost signal strength. For centralized, remote access to settings\nfor all your access points and wireless networks, your Peplink Balance's WLAN Controller offers\nWeb administration. Once you've enabled Web administration, the\nWLAN Controller automatically generates a secure Admin Password to prevent unauthorized\naccess to your AP One’s Web Admin Interface. This password can be changed manually or by\nclicking the Generate button. In either case, this password is used strictly\nfor accessing the AP One Web Admin Interface. We've finished creating our AP profile, so\nwe'll click Save to store it. Now let’s have a look at the AP profile\nfor the 2nd floor. As you can see, we’ve chosen the Manager\nand Staff wireless networks for this profile, which features its own settings and password. After clicking Save to store our changes,\nwe'll click Apply Changes to make them active. Now that we've created our AP profiles, it's\ntime to assign them to our access points. Let’s start by navigating to the Dashboard. Next, we'll click the Control Panel button\nfound in the WLAN Information section. To apply the 1st Floor AP profile, we'll locate\nthe listing for the AP One on the first floor of our office and check its box. Then, we'll select AP Profile from the dropdown\nmenu in the lower right corner. In the AP Profile dialog box, we'll select\nthe previously created 1st Floor AP profile and click OK. The selected AP profile is then assigned to\nthe AP One located on the first floor. Now we'll check the remaining boxes and select\nthe 2nd Floor AP Profile. When we click OK, the 2nd Floor AP profile\nwill be assigned to all three APs located on the second floor of our office. Let’s go back to the Dashboard and have\na look at our new configuration. The WLAN Information section now displays\nthe number of connected access points, as well as the number of connected users. And by clicking the Status button, we can\nverify AP connection name, IP address, firmware version, and more. Congratulations -- you have just learned to\ncreate and configure your AP One connections using the Peplink Balance's WLAN Controller! Thanks for watching!

Start, by clicking on “Network” and then\non “Site-to-site-vpn” Now, click on “Add Vpn connection”. Here, you will create your new site to site\nvpn connection. Lets begin! Start, by choosing a name for you new VPN\nsite to site connection. For example – If your company headquarters\nis in New York and you are connecting to your LA branch you can call it “NY to LA” or\nchoose a name that will be easy to differentiate from your other connections. By Clicking on “Active” you will activate\nyour connection. For security purposes, the “Encryption”\noption will be set to active, but if you prefer to de-activate it, click on the “off”\nbutton Now, enter your peer’s serial number. Doing this will establish the connection between\nyour peplink router and your peer’s router. For example- if you are connecting to your\nLA office, you will need the LA site’s serial number to establish the connection between\nboth sites. In addition to the Peer serial number, you\ncould create a “Pre shared key” to add an additional security measure to your connection. In order for a “pre shared key” to work,\nboth sides have to enter the password set on either side to establish a connection successfully. Now, enter the “Peer IP Address” or the\n“Hostname” of the site you are connecting to. Inputting this information on one side is\nenough to establish the connection between both sides so you can skip this step when\nsetting up your other device. To complete, click on “Save”. You have just completed setting up your peplink\nsite to site VPN, it really is that easy! Now, Click on “Apply Settings changes”\nto go back and see what changed in the main dashboard. As you can see, a new connection has been\ncreated under the “Site-to-Site” VPN section on the dashboard. The VPN connection is now connected and has\nchanged from “connecting” to “connected” “established”. And, the small green lock states that the\nconnection is currently active. You can also easily fine-tune your VPN connection. First, let’s go back to the VPN profile\nby clicking on “Network” and then on “Site-to-site-vpn”. Here, you will be able to optimize your site\nto site VPN connections by prioritizing the WAN connection it uses. Now, Let’s discover the different ways you\ncan set the priority levels of your WAN connections For example – If you set Wan 1 and Wan 2 to priority 1,\nthey will both work simultaneously to maintain optimal load balance at the highest priority. If you set WAN 3 to priority 2, it will start\nworking automatically if WAN 1 and WAN 2 stop working. And finally if you set WAN 4 to “off”\nit won’t work at all for the VPN connection. When you are happy with the settings, click\non “Save”. After setting up your new connection, the\ninterface will return to the Site-To-Site VPN page. Peplink Site-to-Site VPN can failover to another\nconnection if a connection fails. Let’s see how you can adjust the responsiveness\nof the Link Failover Detection. Under the “link failover detection” tab,\nyou will be able to choose pre-set intervals for regular health and maintenance checks\nthat will be conducted automatically. These health checks will make sure that all\nof your sites are connected properly. Just bear in mind that choosing a higher frequency\nmay affect the speed of your connection. We recommend the default of 15 seconds, which\nis the default setting, but its entirely up to you. To complete, click on “Save” and then\non “Apply Settings changes”. Now, we are back to the dashboard. Access all your VPN connection details by\nclicking on “Status”. Here, you will get access to your: IP name\nand connections. And finally, Click on the arrow to find out\nwhich tunnel is available for bonding. Congratulations! You have configured your Site-to-Site VPN\nsuccessfully.
