proof clean and weatherproof we've got a solution for you that takes all the guess work out and gives you everything you need come along with us I'll tell you all about [Music] it so about 3 years ago I started doing a couple blog posts with a product called iotech and iotech is a German company that developed the really Nifty split grommets uh that allow you to bring cables from the outside in with big terminated ends already on them and it's fully modular and fully customizable and if you're anything like me and you maybe are switching out kit or you're upgrading or you're thinking about going with starlink or maybe you're going with cellular you kind of want to build a roof uh cable entry system once and not really think about it ever again it also puts us puts value into to your RV by creating something that's future proof weather weatherproof and if you want to take your stuff with you and go you can leave this box just add blank inserts in there and the next buyer has a way to get cables down that's really really easy the kit comes with everything you see here and the point here was really to kind of include everything that 95% of our customers would really need in a single kit and then just have some very basic optional accessories so we give you more grommets as you can see here than than you have spaces for and the reason for that is we've provided some extra blanks um as well as some optional starlink um or we boost accessory or grommets here to give you kind of everything you need if you're doing one of our bundles you'll notice that some of them have 5 in one or 7 in one or 11 in one antennas if you're going all the way up to dual 5G and what we've done is we've set up The Grommet system so that you've got everything you need really the only optional accessory that you'd look at is if you had a entrylevel um bundle that just had two cellular antennas you'd want to get the two optional um blank inserts um that is included on the listing page they're very inexpensive and they would just plug two of the holes that you see in uh these these 5 mmtimes 4 uh grommets but if you have a a 7 in1 um or an 11 in1 like our speed demons uh is a 7 in1 our road warrior 7 in1 our old ultimate Road Warrior is an 11 in1 uh you you've got everything you need right in the kit right out of the box additionally we've included a 7 mm and an 8 mm uh over here and the 7 mm is good for if you're adding a web Boost Cellular booster not typically needed for mobile internet but if you're um if you want it for voice calls or if you want to boost in really Fringe environments we have other videos on why or why not boosters um that's included um that'll also work with the starlink uh all the the starlink current models so the the Starling gen 3 V4 dish will go with this lower grommet and if you have the Starling high performance dish it would use this grommet up here so again you've got everything you need included going over what's included in the kit real quick you've got your uh weatherproof enclosure here that's got the pre-installed 6 in1 iote here um with the uh pre-installed with the neoprene gasket and all stainless steel Hardware you've got the collar here uh it's like a 3 and 1/2 in it's designed on purpose to not peek through the bottom into your internal space because there is an optional um kit that can cover the hole on the inside and give you a nylon brushed finish that really just finishes out the install really well so we left de pre the uh the factory one short enough where it shouldn't protrude um past your roof line in most installations uh in terms of what else you see here you've got four blank grommets you have two 5 mm * 4 grommets that's for cellular and Wi-Fi wires you have one uh 2 mm here which is for the GPS antenna and then you have one uh 7 mm at the bottom here actually and one 8 mm here the 7 millim is for your wee boost um cellular boosters as well as for your starlink Gen 4 uh I'm sorry gen 3 V4 dishes the kind of current dishes as the time of this filming and then you've got an 8 U millim which is for the Starling high performance uh fix Mount dish if that's an option additionally we've included two just custom basic cable glands here if there's something that you wanted to add that maybe doesn't fit these um and you didn't want to buy the specific GL uh you've got these as available and those will just twist and tighten right around any cable that you have not as useful in terms of you can't run wires through these that are pre-terminated uh as easily uh but it's there and it's available for custom installation so you get two of those and then you get your mounting screws uh pretty much the only thing that's not a stainless screw is these mounting screws these are zinc coated um and the reason why I didn't go with stainless on these um is because uh I hate when I'm trying to install these on a roof and they're not magnetic because you're trying to basically use a drill and you want it to stick down and you've got the die core everywhere and you're like oh I just need to get this screw down and I also want it to have self-tapping head on it so it can get through this plastic if you have a custom if you're not going to use one of the the kind of pre uh drilled area holes um or if uh you've got to get through something on the roof like if you have an ATC or something with a metal roof you now you've got a self-tapping screw those things aren't typically available in stainless and if they are you really want a magnetic and since this is the inside of the box it's not going to get wet anyway that zinc coating is more than enough for you everything else on the exterior including the nuts and bolts and Hardware um that you see here are all going to be of that stainless steel fit and finish moving on to the conduits that you see here uh these this one comes with it so this about three and a half inches and if you move up to this guy here in the middle I think it's close to Six I think I made this five and a five and 3/4 um so that this would probably protrude in most roof installations down through your interior ceiling if that's something you were looking to finish and then for certain applications where you need even deeper this is about a seven uh and a half a little it's a seven and uh 916 I think there was a little shrinkage on our on our printer there but figure this is seven and 3/4 um and that would definitely protrude through almost any roof installation so there's a couple different options available depending on kind of how far you want this to protrude down through the inside of your installation or if you don't want it to protrude at all and you want to use our optional um nylon uh EOTech uh finish fit interior uh and let run the cables through that that's really my kind of go-to way of installing it as you can see there in my ATC I just love the fit and finish and the way that looks that's why we've included the short collar in the kit in terms of like a typical installation you would be taking uh this box and you'd be kind of fitting out where all of your wires were going to go say you had a 7 in-one uh antenna that you mounted up on the roof um you know a surface mount antenna maybe with a magnet Mount over there you'd have those cables coming over maybe you have a starlink maybe you have a wee boost from mounted another location everything's going to come back to this Central box and then go down inside typically to wherever your kind of central wiring cabinet is down below inside the vehicle now the idea of this install and how this all works is you're going to drill a 2in hole in the roof and that's going to give you a futureproof way to get wires down and pull wires out of that vehicle for really the rest of the life of the vehicle I want to tell you a little bit about why I like this installation method so much I know it's super scary to drill a 2in hole in the roof but if you look it if you ever take an air conditioner off you'll notice that there's a hole in the roof about this big it's about 16 in by 16 in and the only thing holding the water out on that is this tiny little foam gasket so if Done Right water's not going to get into the vehicle what I like about this installation method is just how future proof it is what typically gets folks in trouble with water coming into a vehicle is taking on and off equipment or having a problem and removing something and then putting it back and messing with the seals more than once or messing with the screw holes that are already in the roof more than once by doing the installation like this by using a bit of dcor around here having that 2-in hole down having this conduit go through the vehicle what you essentially get when you're done is whenever you open up this box on the roof Ro this is what you see you see this nice clean perfect conduit that allows you to run wires down through the vehicle and what that means for the most part is that you can pull wires out you can put them in you can change out your grommets on the front and you're not going to be stuck with some box that's filled with goo that you've got to then clean up and deal with later on I want to take a minute to talk to you about kind of drilling a hole in the roof and kind of my best practices um but uh also kind of tell folks look yeah it's it's at your own risk this is something that you can call a professional and have them do and it's possible that professional will not do as good of a job as you would yourself um but that's to each his own here's kind of what I recommend you do when you're looking for a good installation location the first thing you're going to look for is you want to kind of figure out where your wires are going to end up where's your central kind of wiring location and for the most part the way I approach that is I look for where the factory standard wiring location is you know where did the the the factory put all of their I you know their it or their stereo gear or their TV gear and I typically want to end up in that same location the reason being is there's usually 12vt and 120 volt power in that location and it's typically not in a slide for the most part some some are um but uh it's somewhere where wires can more easily get down from the roof and from other locations once I've figured out kind of the general area of where I want to make my installation I then look for the air conditioning ducks in the vehicle and typically obviously Marine applications will be very different but in an RV which is where I have the most experience you're typically dealing with them going down the center of the vehicle so as you look for your exit vents you'll sort of understand oh okay that's where my ac ducts are now the AC ducks are typically wider than the vents that you see um it allows them to really kind of drill up into that AC duct and sort of Miss and still be okay so you know just be mindful of that a lot of times you can actually take off one of your AC covers and just feel around in there and you can actually feel where the edges are and that'll give you an idea if you do hit an air conditioning duct it's not the end of the world although I would not recommend you continue drilling through it I would probably fill that hole with spray foam and then put some eternabond or something else on the roof so that be a worst case scenario you want to just kind of plan it's the measure twice cut once mentality so try to miss an air conditioning duct that's my first bit of advice the next thing you want to be mindful of is you don't want to hit wires that are run through the ceiling by the factory or by somebody else so look up on your roof on the inside and go is there anything that might be wired through here even if you look up there you might still miss some wires I found wires in the roof of all sorts of funny places bundles of wires that you definitely don't want to cut through but for the most part my trick for installing from the top down is I grab myself either a quarter inch or a 38 inch drill bit quarter inch is typically uh the best because it's the smallest and once I've sort of figured out my pilot hole location I drill down from that location now before I drill I typically look around and I can use a stud finder actually on the roof and I try to avoid any studs uh that basically are holding up the frame of the vehicle I don't want to drill into those metal aluminum or wood depending on the vehicle that you have U studs stud finder will work but also if you just walk around the roof you'll feel them because they're very rigid and then you'll feel these low areas in between those braces and that's typically where I want to drill so I grab my quarter inch drill now I have a long about basically a 12in or 18inch drill bit I think it's a great thing to have in your toolkit especially if you're going to be doing any kind of uh roof penetration work now I'll drill straight down in my pilot hole location very slowly and I'll as soon as I penetrate the top of the roof and that piece of wood that's above there you're going to basically hit the insulation layer that's an open empty cavity if you don't if you hit metal then you've probably hit a stud or if you hit metal you might have hit an air conditioning duct so by going slow with a nice little quarter inch bit you can determine that you've hit an empty cavity or pocket once I've determined that it's empty I push the drill through I don't drill through I just push it through until I hit the next layer of material which is typically the ceiling inside of the the the vehicle uh once I hit that I then drill through that as well I go inside and I check where I've landed and in most cases I've landed exactly where I want to be because I've measured multiple times and I go okay cool now I know where I need to be I then take my 2-in hole saw and I drill down using that Center hole from my little quarter inch at to hold my whole saw exactly where I want to be and I and I drill down from there taking special care to only go through the top layer of the roof once I pop through the top layer of the roof I pull the drill back and that exposes the insulation and it allows me to look for cables and other wires inside of the roof to make sure that I'm not going to drill through a bundle of wires now if I see a bundle of wires oh it's okay they're typically not attached to anything and you can simply push them out of the way you could ball up some newspaper and kind of shove them over into a corner if you need to anything you want so that you can continue Drilling and then take that material out when you're done and let the wires go back to where they were next I go into the vehicle and I have my pilot hole from my quarter inch uh bit in down below low and I drill up taking special care to only drill through the amount of material that is from the ceiling Now by drilling up with my whole saw with the second part I'm going to have the least amount of risk to damage any SE sealing material padded sealing material Etc because from cutting from the inside up I'm just going to give myself the cleanest hole possible by using that long quter inch pilot drill hole I basically have ensured that my two holes top and bottom are going to line up perfectly because my drill bit was straight and as long as you drill straight down you're going to be perfectly fine and you're going to be good to go as

{"id": "wYlY62WcKOg", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "XTwxUMjDkUYhrFuC_5tZXYLBF_s", "transcript": "hey guys this is Andy from mobile must have in this video we're going over a brand new product from peplink called the peplink antenna [Music] Max now here at mobile must we're really excited about this particular product drop as it opens up kind of a new realm for what you're able to do with peplink their routers and this new antenna now real quick what this is is this is going to be a 7 inone antenna however it's slightly different in the fact that you put the router inside you get to choose out of a couple selections of which router you want I've got a couple I'll show you here in a demo so this makes it very flexible as to what you want this antenna to be you can do it as a 5G antenna it supports all the 5G uh ranges but you can also put in something like a Transit Pro and get dual modem off of this as well we'll go more into that later so this video is going to be kind of in three or a couple sections overall I'll put chapter markers down below if you want to jump ahead we're going to first talk about what is the antenna kind of what are the specs for it and all that kind of stuff then I want to drive into what routers will fit inside of it and then I want to go over a couple specific use cases we're really excited that this can now be used for uh and then we'll also talk about installation as there are a couple included different ways you can mount this um and install this all with what's comes in the box so let's first talk about the antenna this antenna is supposed to get you a 7.4 G gain overall so it's going to be a huge Improvement on just signal strength over what we call the paddle antennas that come included uh so a really great option if you're looking to get kind of a better signal overall and you just need more range out of what you've got this is a great option now like I said in the beginning this is designed to have a router directly inside it is watertight you can see the the weather ceiling there and then on the back of this you have ports where you can run certain or different types of cable in and out of this if you wanted to run just a regular 12vt or power source up to this you can do that there's enough room but if you also wanted to run something like Poe maybe you have a switch further away or where you're managing the rest of your kind of your it aspects of it you can run a powered ethernet cable up to it and that can be an option too now really the best power option is going to be based on what type of device you have certain devices allow po certain don't so it's hard to answer exactly in this video what the right way for power is but it is an option um and if you have any questions specifically on power reach out to us at mobile mus have we have uh a couple different Poe options so if you're looking to do Poe you want it to come off the switch peplink has some direct options that are OEM from peplink we also have some great ones that run just off of 12 volt and have UPS scalers built in and you can run that too but again it depends on which unit you're working with at this moment in time of recording this video some support Poe some don't and I know pep link is working on bringing everything up to a more kind of standard set there now for this next section about routers I I have good and bad news and I'm going to start with the bad news the bad news is it is slightly restrictive as to what devices will fit inside um it doesn't fit obviously everything that Ping's ever made it's a pretty small kind of form factor which is the benefit uh but the good news is is most popular products we sell here at mobile must have the most popular ones we sell do fit inside so there's very limit very small limitations on our side as the four main units we sell will fit in here the three main units we fit we will fit uh the first one we'll cover is the br1 mini um this particular one I'm holding here um is the cat 7 version that will fit in fine but you can also do the the uh the br1 mini 5G there's no Wi-Fi in that particular model but if you're just running this up and then connecting it to a switch you might just needed as a modem that could be a great option it's also very inexpensive for a 5G router you can also fit the transit Pro Series in here too so this is going to be um a Transit Duo uh Transit Pro Duo so the the Dual cat 12 one they just released will fit in but the previous version uh the the cat 12 and Cat 7 will also fit you can also do the transit Core Series any any of the transit Series in this longer form format will also work and the last one which I don't have sitting here in front of me is going to be the br1 pro uh that'll be the cat uh 20 and the 5G version they will also fit in here so those are three of the main popular units we sell and mobile must have and the three that fit in here so it is a great option if you're looking for this now I wanted to switch over to use cases and some of you might be struggling to be like why would you put a router in this and Up on the Roof I can see that depending on your use case we are really excited about this particular option as in some install especially if you're in the Marine space or in the commercial space you don't have access to an antenna that is nearby I know on my RV my router and antenna are I don't know maybe 3 feet apart so it's really easy to keep the router inside and the antenna the the actual cable itself isn't that long so there's not that much loss if you're going for a further distance like on a sailboat where you have a 20 30 40 foot mass you're going to have a very long cable that runs to that antenna the loss on that cable length is so great it's almost it's just not even worth having an antenna there um at all so what can be really beneficial is putting the router inside the antenna itself and then running an ethernet cable that distance the difference between running an ethernet cable over distance is there's relatively no loss at all uh versus an antenna has a very fast drop off so adding everything kind of in one place um you can then put it outside you can put it up high you can put it where you need to get the signal and then then you can use an Ethernet to really get you that distance based on your particular installation now installing of this is really quite simple and you have a couple options the easiest one is going to be to surface mount it with the sticker pad it comes with so you stick this down on the surface you want you can stick this right down on top of it and you're done it's pretty pretty straightforward and self-explanatory now from a installed type you have a couple options though for your cables so how you're installing it really might matter more where you need the cables to go you'll first see there is going to be a hole in the bottom so if you wanted to drop the ethernet cable that comes out of this through the bottom or your power cable however you're kind of doing that you can do that there's enough room for easily both a 12vt power and a uh ethernet cable there however you also have builtin ports on the back now this case they're using just kind of the standard plugs it comes with the cable glands you need to run a cable through here as well very there's two um big ones designed for ether and then there's a smaller one if you just wanted to run power and do that as well uh so really flexible now if you're going out the side that works great for surface mount then you can go down like a solar drop or any other cables you've got this also will include a wall mount option where you can mount to run on a wall have the cable again come down the back or the side as well as a pull mount option that uses a lot of the same Hardware it's very flexible and what I really like is that peplink included all of those mounting options inside basically the core package so there's no additional add-ons the only add-on that they don't include um is for the Marine space if you wanted to do kind of the Marine pole mount um that is an option it is compatible the mounting options are here on the bottom they just don't include that in this because they know that's probably the least likely mounting option but it's a great one if you're in the Marine space want it kind of off the deck a bit um you can do that as well final part of this video is I was just going to actually put the br1 mini directly onto this I'm trying not to scratch it on this metal table here um but let's actually unbox this uh let's actually do a quick install of this br1 mini so you can see what it looks like and see kind of what the process looks like [Music] [Music] all right and there we have it so this is what the br1 mini looks like the cables are really nice and pretty tightly wound in here which keeps them from rattling um if you're using all of them or not even using all of them in this case I actually unlatched the two Wi-Fi ones which are latched down uh so I could use them for the br1 mini Cat 7 uh and then I have two extra uh LTE or 5G antennas in this particular use case um because this is going to be a 7 in one intenna you still get your GPS um so overall you're getting that you know four four cellular 2 Wii one GPS component great antenna very exciting that this is now going to be available this is already available at mobilus have.com so if you're interested it is available and shipping today now if you want more information MC which is our partner in education is doing a deep dive look into this uh if you would like to learn more about and how the antenna is performing comparisons against the like the 42g antenna or the pars antennas or anything else in our lineup they do a lot of great actual performance analysis on these antennas for their members now if you're not a member you can become a member of mobile musthave and get included membership in with their account as well so that can be a great option plus when you do that you will get a discount on all Hardware purchased from us as being a member yourself lots of great features and lots you get upgraded shipping um discounts on data plans all kinds of things when you're being a member so if you're interested uh that could be a great option for you but yeah this is going to be the peplink

come along with us I'll tell you all about [Music] it so I've been spoiled for quite a while I'm going to actually put down a little microfiber here so I don't scratch up my table when I move this around and show you guys but um I jumped right in the deep end when I was uh just getting into rving I'd spoken to some folks who had done it for a long time and they said to go with a diesel pusher and because it was replacing my home and I was able to do that from a budget perspective I jumped right in and started out with a power hose reel and kind of just thought that's how it should be done um as things progressed and as we started doing more trade shows and as I got more experience I understood that that's not how most people experience their water hoses and a lot of folks travel trailers my ATC that we use for the trade shows and other stuff really are just coiling up hoses putting them in bags or just putting them in storage and trying to figure out where to put them on a regular basis so when Corbin the CEO of blue and I started talking about different accessories that might be interesting uh we started talking about hose reels and specifically we talked a little bit about what I didn't love about the hose reel that came in my Integra coach and how we might be able to improve it before we get into a ton of that stuff um you know let's just go over some Basics here so what really is going on here so this is a 50ft uh retractable hose reel that is designed and built on a on a frame and a chassis that's been tested for quite a while obviously blue is customized it heavily but this is something this is sort of like built or based off of a design that's been used in auto body shops and other things typically for Air Supply hoses now nothing related to Air Supply hoses is in this system but the design concept is important because the idea being that these are typically mounted on the ceiling and they are designed to help you get access to but also retract up you know 50 plus feet of very heavy rubber air hose in a shop what that really means for us is that the spring system and the gearing system in this allows us to run drinking water safe high-end uh water hoses that blue is known for in a similar style chassis while getting the ability to have a retraction system that we know is going to last for years to come now in my 9 plus years of full- timing with Integra coaches multiple I've gone through three hose reels and with each one of those uh well there's been a couple different failures but I've gone through three motor failures and I got to the point where I started to get kind of sick of the whole idea or concept of a 12vt or 120 volt um real system that required power it also just it's one more thing to break so by doing something that's fully mechanical it opens up what kind of installation options you have at your disposal and um you know you don't really have to worry about Motors and other things breaking or requiring power one of the things I was most worried about was you know size honestly I was like how can we get this thing to be um something that would fit in most Bays or be something that could be retro fit in into motor homes that hadn't come with an original power reel I think they've done a really nice job here I mean the the total width on this I'm going to say is 8 in but I'm giving it a little bit of extra um you know what let's say eight and a half as total width just to give us a little bit of extra room there um you know I think I'm probably a quarter inch proud on that which is fine um from a height perspective we're talking about uh a 14 and A4 um 14 and a/4 in and then from an overall width perspective going from kind of the widest spot we're looking at about uh 15 in and that being the largest number because of the um the pulley system here or kind of the cable guide system here that I'll talk about why that's important in a minute now with everything Blue Tech it's always so important to talk about water quality and water safety and really kind of besides the fact that we're using these drinking water safe hoses always the stainless steel Quick Connect solutions that blue is so well known for I love these quick connects check out our videos on the Quick Connect system if you haven't seen that already it makes the entire water experience like night and day easier and these are quick connects that are built for way more pressure than water so they just last forever I love my quick connects I haven't had a single one fail I think Andy had one fail but I think it got like dropped in the dirt a 100 times so they've been just unbelievably reliable for us and the entire water um Inlet system here again is also stainless steel and this comes with the Quick Connect system here so you can quick connect this and attach it if you've got a factory garden hose attachment you don't have to be a plumbing expert to get this thing installed you can go straight from your existing City fill or a version of that right into this now if you're replacing a an existing reel or if you just want to Plum this in without the quick connects they're all fully removable um this is a prototype unit um I've got to double check that the ones that we have in stock are identical but I know that you can definitely Plum these in directly to PEX using either half inch or 3/4 inch um MNT fittings so you know just standard threaded fittings using some uh some Teflon tape you'll be fine and good to go um but you've got the quick connects all pre-installed and just such a beautiful heavyduty stainless steel there you hope folks can see kind of what that looks like it's just it's such a nice fit and finish there and just the gaskets in there that allow it to rotate just feels so so highend such good quality I love it by utilizing this type of mounting system here and I love Corbin you are right we talked about doing this in Gray and I and then ultimately we ended up doing it in blue CU of you know all of our the new generation water filters were going to match this super cool blue uh color and it just it really did come out just beautiful and really cool if you're trying to to just kind of get a nice look in a bay where you want everything to just look super high-end but this kit and the roller system that you see here on the on the output allows me to really Mount this in a variety of different ways and applications I can mount it the way you see it here just mounting it straight down to the floor I can mount it straight up to the ceiling by flipping it over or I can mount it to the back wall now make sure you you you know have a a good strong sturdy wall or reinforce it with a piece of plywood or whatnot but I can mount it basically this way as well and I can also mount it if I flip it around this way as well um I wouldn't probably recommend that I think down would be the right way to go because it would just be great but the the cable because of the way these pulleys are made you just you can have that cable come up and out or whatnot now this I just took the bolt out of this because I was testing it that's why it's flopping around but your factory one's not going to flop around it's going to be secured and you can basically remove this and put this exactly where you want so you dial in your exact stopping point of where the Reel is going to stop really nice uh touch just so you you know you've got a good stopper and you're not going to risk this thing flying in and possibly damaging the hose now for folks that under who've worked in a shop you're probably pretty used to these these uh types of and um they basically have a a a sound that is the system locking into place and there's three clicks that basically indicate that the unit is locked so it could be confusing for folks have never used one you're like how come this isn't retracting but once I explain how it works you'll understand it it's very simple so if I want to pull this out and have it stop say like around out here I'm just going to pull it out until I'm at the desired length I want and wait for one of those three clicks one two three one two 3 and then I'm stop and I'm I'm I'm done that's it this cable will not go in now if I want to retract it all I have to do is wait until the clicks are done I hear the last click and then I can let the unit go all the way in so if I go backwards again click click now I have no clicks it'll just go right back in So when you hear that first click you can stop and the unit will be locked in place and when you want to retract it simply pull it again until you hear no clicks and then let that go in gently and it will retract all the way in so once again locked and that will keep doing that all the way for the total length go past that and go ahead and retract now I was a little skeptical at first I have to be honest about the stainless steel braided hoses that bluek initially released but I've been very happy with them they are some of the easiest hoses to coil up and they take up so little space and it's what also allows this hose reel to have so much product on a relatively small Reel with a good solid amount of retraction power to make sure that the thing can uh retract itself up into the vehicle now with that said I still would recommend that you wear gloves especially if you're going to be running your hands while this is retracting because it's possible that a metal burrow might have popped out if a hose was stepped on repeatedly or something like that and just you know you just want to be safe another thing you want to be really mindful of with any hose reel um or any power reel is do not operate this and start to try to retract it very far away from the Reel it's a very dangerous way to retract a reel like this if you accidentally lose control of this hose while it's very far out you could end up in a situation where it's pulling itself back in really quickly so what I recommend is that you always operate the Reel just like you would a power reel close to the vehicle unhook your hose just like you would with your power reel and then move over to the coach here put on a pair of gloves and then just allow yourself to hand feed that in to retract it all the way that way if for some reason it did get away from you for a second you're at the Reel and you can always just grab the hose again right at the entry point going over a couple other the thing comes in at around 28 29 lbs uh for that much hose and for such solid construction with stainless steel um I think that's pretty comparable to what you're going to see with other power reels um possibly a little bit lighter so that's a nice touch this guy right here uh is actually going in my dad's Holiday Rambler he's got a 2006 Holiday Rambler and he's been lugging hoses and hates it so we're going to be putting in a nice power reel for him I think he's going to love this and I suspect I'm going to end up with one fairly soon as soon as I end up with my fourth electric power reel failure which I'm sure is coming um especially now that I've seen this but it's a great power reel um that is not requiring power so I love it um and uh it's a great it's a great unit this along with just about everything at mobilus have.com is available for uh membership discounts so uh you get you get uh a whole bunch of

field of the new viair uh air compressor systems that are now in stock here at mobile [Music] musam now if you are new to viair overall this is absolutely one of my favorite and and Absolut critical mus have units as I personally feel it is absolutely terrifying to have any Tire issues while on the road managing 14 tires between the truck the spare and the RV and the RV spare it's just a lot of tires to manage I'm constantly filling up one tire or something has a slow leak the kids have bikes and tires and balls it's just it's everywhere we are needing compressed air and I have to say we've been traveling with this viair now for five years I would say and it is Rock Solid so this is the one that you might have seen you might be familiar with um I personally carry the 400p RV um and that's the one we've had it's been a great unit I would recommend it for absolutely everybody they have smaller units you can do something like the the 300 if you're in a van um and you're you do not have dual tires uh that can be a good option and they have a great one for your garage if you just need like a regular one for your car you just want a nice one that's the 89 now they even have a nice portable one uh which is this one which I I carry on me everywhere um it struggles honestly to do the bigger tires uh anything over 80 lbs um but is great for absolutely everything else bike tires balls it comes with all the little accessories I've done it on small car tires um it's battery powered you just twist it on you put the pressure in that you want hit go and you don't even touch it it's awesome so this is an option too this is the portable one but what I'm here to talk about is the 400 and the 450 version from V has gotten a big black upgrade [Music] only the the 400s and the 450 got this upgrade the EF stands for enhanced flow they will fill your tires 10% faster than before which was already crazy fast and they did a few key things that I really think are beneficial to the overall design one they did a great way of it looking and they blacked out the whole thing and it just looks awesome the bag is black you get a black hand pump so they just did a really good job of just kind of keeping it looking cool overall um the the they fixed kind of the tags the tags are upside down on some of them so they've done a really good job with this overall design it's more or less the same size um you are going to like I said get that 10% performance boost but what I really like what they did is they actually they still have the cord but they gave you a standard kind of more uh 12v cord and what you can do is you can change out the top now in the Box it will come with more or less what I had before which is just going to be clamps for your batteries but with this particular cord and I'll give you the name here so if you want to search for other options you can get a ton of different accessories I have an accessory for this that will allow me to use a Ryobi battery and I use that for like a a mass raater pump and all types of things so you can get different type of battery clamps you can hardwire this into a 12vt system if you're if you're putting this somewhere where you have a standard or like a regular power Source uh you can put this onto different batteries DeWalt batteries U Milwaukee batteries depending on that do you have all these different types of options there are successories for all of that not necessarily here in M Musta but you can get those anywhere depending on kind of what your power situation is it makes it a lot more flexible they've kept the longer length of basically this particular attachment this goes right into your gun so if you want to screw this onto your tire you can stand and still feel it fill it fill your tire the initial ones were only I don't know I guess they were like 9 in maybe a foot long they've now made them a meter so you can really stand and fill your air and check your gauge all while uh while standing up so that's really been a big Improvement this is a really great uh Vier option now these are going to be on sale for Black Friday they're on sale now as as this video is going live um so if you're looking for this this a great time to kind of get them at a discount last thing we are actually giving this exact unit away the one I'm touching in my hands and there's going to be some fun

{"id": "9J8LmIDHvpE", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "bt8diLlewlPv40hJcQFrkY0XpnQ", "transcript": "one via your vital air source makers of these portable compressors that we've had at mobile must have for quite a while has just released two new models specific for the RV Market I've got my old model here we're going to do some head-to-head testing see what that enhanced flow and 20% increase in performance means and I got a nail gun here we're going to put this up against a traditional compressor and just see how good these portable compressors really are are come along with us I'll tell you all about [Music] it before we get started make sure to like And subscribe this video I know every channel tells you to do that but at the tail end of 2024 and into 2025 we're changing things up here at mobilus have.com one of the things we're doing is that we are giving away products that are featured in new product launches so for this particular sequence we're actually going to be giving away a 450p top-of-the line via air in future videos so if you like And subscribe this video my partner in crime Andy is going to take this device out into the wild and do future videos which will include information about how you can win that in a giveaway only way you're going to know about that is if you like And subscribe as always we've included chapter links Below in the video so that you can hop around our in-depth reviews and product launches tend to be be a little bit more lengthy but those chapter lengths let you hop around to get to the information you need so to give you kind of an idea of just how amazing these compressors are I've got this hooked up to my extremely leaky 10-year-old nail gun there and no fire doesn't say we should be using this pump with a nail gun but it's a good example to kind of show you just how powerful these are and how quickly they can get back their compression uh up to the the proper PSI so I've got a 3/4 inch piece of plywood here it's about the least scientific way I can do this I'm going to see if this will shoot a nail through here which it should no problem but more importantly I'm going to try to shoot a couple in succession after that to show how quickly the compressor can recover and this just is really what separates this out from a lot of the Chinese stuff you see on Amazon that is essentially trying to copy it but with much lower uh performance components so let's give it one shot clearly no problem there pump's doing a little recovering and we're good to go let's see what happens if we try to put four Nails in all at once so I went with eight as fast as I could and I think the seventh one didn't go but I actually think that was cuz this gun is very old and it's not designed for that but they all penetrated right through no problem so there's a lot of Chinese knockoffs that we see out there on Amazon and other locations that look very similar we all know China is well known for creating something that's virtually identical to a US company's product but when you open it up it's nowhere near the same we're going to do some fill tests in a moment uh we'll go outside and show you but I can tell you that there have been quite a few units that we've tested just because people have brought them to our attention and asked if we could possibly carry a lower cost option and they just don't perform or if they do perform they get so hot that you could literally burn yourself on the units and they just are a little bit of a safety concern for me so be really careful V has been doing this for a very long time they're trusted by the manufacturers just about everybody who's been doing this for a while will tell you via is the company to go with here at mobilus have.com one of the most popular questions we get is what's the difference between the 400 and the 450 and which one is right for me based on my use case before we talk about that which is going to be next we're going to talk about what is pretty much the same with the two models and what is the same is really what's kind of included in the Box the accessories for both these models in the new revision are identical in each of these kits you're going to get two of these 30ft highly compact high flow air hoses these can connect together so you get up to 60 ft which can allow you to really get around the vehicle to fill all the tires I have a 45 ft Class A I have absolutely no problem with this while leaving the pump back where my batteries are Additionally you get your trigger handle here and this is your this is just a great unit in terms of when you're sitting down there and you have to fill tires that are large and you're kind of having to get into areas they've designed this in a way that really just makes it super easy to fill so you've got a quick connect connector here and a quick connect connector here and a high visibility gauge here in addition on this handle you've got a release here so you can let air out if you've accidentally overfilled and you really want to dial things in perfectly in terms of what you connect up to this you have two options you can use the long wand here that I think is really kind of optimized for um for dues um and for you know vehicles that have more than one tire mounted on a uh on an axle on the same side um this allows you right here you'll see this is a quick connect so that would Quick Connect right into there and give you a nice long reach here to get into those outer and inner tires with this particular angled head I've been able to get into areas on my RV and on other friends RVs um I think I was specifically in a tiffen where they had actually turned the tire valves inwards so they weren't actually facing outwards you can change that by the way on most coaches and point them outwards but in that case where the factory left it that way maybe it was going to hit another rim or they forgot whatever this unit here allows you to go in and fill from here if the valve is pointing inwards or you can fill from here on the outside if it's facing you really nice wand touch here for me though the vast majority of the time when I'm filling a tire and I've got to be there for a little while this is what I use and this is a 40in long what I call the knee saver cable um it quick connects directly right like that into the wand but now I can stand up without leaning down on the tire and this other end just screws right on just like it's just a nice Threaded Screw on right onto the valve stem cap allowing me to stand up and fill with ease again high visibility screen here to see exactly how much pressure is going in and as soon as you let off of the release and the trigger it will give you the reading of whatever you're filling wrapping up accessories and what is the same in these two kits you're also going to get uh some replacement air intake filters and then a nice complement of different tips here you've got two tips for filling like toys like like pool toys um you've got a needle for filling up balls and other things that have a a needle uh input and then you've got a little shraer valve adapter for European cycling tires the ones that have kind of the longer and thinner tip that will adapt you to the standard uh us us version that you see in cars and whatnot uh lastly on the power input side all of them have the same SAE style cable so you get a nice heavy gauge I believe that's 10 gauge wire going into the into the uh into both of the pumps it's fused here so you've got I believe a 30 amp dc fuse at 12 volts in both of the kits right there and then that SAE plug you see there allows you to hook up to the included alligator clips for connecting directly to the battery what's nice about this SAE option now is you can buy these cables make sure you get a nice heavy gauge one like a 10 gauge um cable and you could hardwire this into a location by your batteries or in another location um so you don't have to always clip to this you can just walk up and connect this way and then keep this in your bag so that you still have the pump for portable use forgot to mention on the accessories just to wrap that up the bag they all include a nice bag and they've improved the bag since the previous generation it's a little bit smaller and it tends to sit at a smaller footprint the the previous generation had one of the air hoses here and one of them on the back and then a big hole in the middle this one they've stacked the two air hoses in the front put the compressor compartment in the back and it's just allowed the bag to be a little bit smaller when you're using a portable compressor it's going to create heat that's sort of the nature of how this all operates V is one of the best when it comes to heat management they really know how to make this system run as cool as possible but you're still going to create heat I've used some of the cheaper stuff that you see on Amazon during some testing and I can tell you you can literally give yourself a third degree burn with some of the junk that's out there one thing I love is this if you look at this air hose here it's got this heavily insulated uh component here that allows you if you've been doing an extended fill on a very large Tire to connect and disconnect that hose fast without having to wait for it to cool down this will really protect you and and everything that you've got uh that you don't want to get burned from trouble by making sure that those hot ends stay insulated okay so on to the differences the 400 versus the 450 why do you care and which one's best for you so the 400's cheaper it's also lighter it's about 10 lb is for the pump um a little more if you include all the accessories I'm just going to go off the raw compressor unit so uh about 10 lbs there you're going to be about 12 on this unit 123 on this if you go to the old style this is almost 13 so you do save about a quar pound uh on the newer models they we'll talk about performance in a little bit but specifically this is going to be lighter and cheaper it's going to be a little bit heavier more expensive so this one's going to fill faster right that's where it gets tricky so the 400 actually has a higher CFM rating of 2 .54 CFM it can actually fill a tire faster but it's cheaper what's that all about the 450 has a CFM rating of 2.12 CFM so it's heavier and it's slower and it's more expensive why would I buy that and why did you buy it Eric because you have a 450 well it actually comes down to the duty cycle or the amount of time that the pump can continually run without having to rest keeping it simple duty cycle is usually shown in percentages and it's like a percentage of time it can run uh per hour right so this actually has 100% duty cycle which in theory means it can run for an entire hour uninterrupted now the instruction manual will tell you that you should let this rest uh for a bit technically an hour before you run it for another another hour to let it cool down and rest but with 100% duty cycle in theory and technically you can just run this continually um you know they're kind of hedging their bets and pulling back a little bit from a safety concern to say you should let it rest but the reality is this pump can just run continuously we've said that in other videos we've confirmed it with VI a they just don't want people leaving their pumps on 24/7 not that you really could but it can do it moving to the 400 a larger piston move moving more air creating more heat but filling your tires faster comes at the cost of a lower duty cycle rating so this is I think it's 30% duty cycle which means you can run it continuously for 20 minutes and then you should let it rest for the remainder part of the duty cycle so that would be 40 minutes um that's being highly conservative but that's what the pump is rated for so you can run it for 20 minutes now I'll show you guys later in this video how we're going to do some head-to-head comparisons and I'll show you um basically pumping up a tire from dead flat and 20 minutes is a long time you could pump up a couple tires from dead flat with 20 minutes of time and be good to go The Only Exception I would say is if you're in a big Class A and you have a situation where you've got one of these Massive Tires um that that you know are on a tip like a tractor trailer tire essentially and you might if you had to add a lot of air to a lot of different tires potentially run the pump for more than 20 minutes now it's trade-off because this is going to move at a little bit of a faster speed filling a tire from dead flat like a regular 2500 series truck tire or a big tire from a you know like a like a 45 fft fifth wheel would probably take if it was dead flat to about 40 or 50 psi it would take a pump like this about 6 minutes and it might take this pump 7 minutes so it is a little bit slower but in the grand scheme of things how often are you really filling up a tire from dead flat and does that one minute really matter to you it's a choice for you I made the election to say I don't really want to think about how long my pump can run I'm going to go with a higher end unit even if it's a little bit slower because I know it's going to create less heat and it's going to give me that better duty cycle a lot of people go with the 400 because if you're just traveling and you just want to be able to top off the tire quickly and go and you know that you don't normally have to do more than one tire the 400 is a great option it's faster and it can save you a few bucks so let's talk about some of the improvements over the previous Generation VI a products and if we think that there's anything that has gotten worse or is unimproved well the enhanced flow concept here uh that gives you the 20% Improvement in overall performance which kind of equates are really about 10% faster fill times actually does work uh we'll test some units out there but I've done some head-to-head comparison and the CFM ratings are are pretty accurate in terms of these being better performing units they're also a smidge lighter but there are a few other uh changes or enhancements it's hard to see I'll try to give you a closeup but you'll see some minor pitting and some oxidation on the aluminum on this unit and that's because I store it in a bay where there's occasionally high humidity and humidity can kind of tarnish the aluminum that is going on here in the in the housing of the pump so by moving to this nice gloss black you're going to have fewer issues with tarnishing and for with some other things um but you know it's also kind of cool looking I mean it looks great I'll show you a picture of it next to my my uh my truck and it's just it's a really nice look and they've done it all over even the the um Quick Connect fittings are all in this kind of matte black or midnight black so the whole kit just has a really nice fit and feel with an awesome pop with the red V logos that you see on the unit so they've gone kind of all black additionally to that though they've improved this foot here on the previous model they kind of had this giant rubber plate on the bottom that covered a uh a metal plate underneath it it did have a tendency to curve a little bit over time when in a bag if you were putting the bag down um and it just was plastic on top of rubber they've done is they've actually gone with a kind of a stamped plate design on the newer unit which has saved you some weight and then they've added rubber feet to the bottom instead of the entire unit being rubber it also just kind of looks a little bit more modern and cleaned up um I think it's definitely an improvement but that plate is different um the the mounts of the compressor that um are rubber mounted here to allow it to vibrate without creating a lot of noise uh seem to work really well with this with this sand plate I've really kind of had no issues with either of the units but this just looks a little bit nicer and has a little bit more fit and finish they've gone with a plastic housing here on the air intake uh which is a change from the metal housing that the previous models had now I actually kind of like the plastic I know I'm selling them so I should like them but it's not really that it's actually that the metal just the way that it was machine was very rough in the old models and I found that when I was trying to swap out um the filters they would just it would be really hard to thread on and with the plastic one it's just it's just a little bit easier it's also allowed it to be a little bit Slimmer and the unit I'm pretty sure that's attributing to some of that weight savings that you have as well if the plastic did bother you at all they're actually interchangeable so we can still get the metal ones you could actually just unscrew this guy and it fits into the same hole it's the same thread size so you could technically put a metal air intake on the newer models if if you desire but I don't think you really have a reason to the the one that comes with it is fine as is the onoff switches on the back have really remained unchanged um they work great there's nothing wrong with them they kept them exactly as is the handles also pretty much as is and um other than the performance- wise that's really it for the physicality until you get to the power inputs so on the power input side on the previous generation you were straight to battery clamps that's really all you had you couldn't really do much else so you were going to start having to cut wires and splice stuff in if you didn't want to do a direct battery clamp um which was a concern for some people especially if you wanted a more finished installation look now to simulate some real world testing I'm going to completely deflate this tire and then we're going to time how fast the 450 RV specific with enhanced flow takes to bring this tire up there she goes so the air is pretty much all the way out I'm actually going to put the valve stem in at this point as you can see this tire is it's pretty low I don't want to damage the sidewall of this tire um by unnecessarily having the rim kind of crush the sidewall and I mean we're we're way down at this point this is this has probably got about five PSI in it so we're going to start the [Music] test so just that quickly we're at 28 PSI at this point um and uh it's moving along pretty quick [Music] 46 PSI and climbing things are going pretty well all right so we wrapped it up that's hard as a rock a little too hard I got to let some air out even a a large construction kind of compressor would have taken um probably about 5 or 6 minutes for that to fill up the truck's still a little bit cranky cuz this tire is overfilled so we've got to let some air out in order to get rid of that error but we're going to go back into the studio and uh I couldn't be happier with that 2.12 CFM that was a fast fill for such a big tire very impressive so do you need a portable compressor well yes you absolutely do if you're going to take traveling on the road seriously you have to have a source of air on board with you so that you could stay safe and deal with things that come from the environment whether it's a punctured Tire a slow leak an issue where you had to swap out a spare that's flat or whatever it's very important to have air on board and then look at a tire pressure monitoring solution like the ones we have from TST so that you can quickly know when you have an issue it happens fast a nail in a tire or it happens slow you just got new tires they didn't seal the bead properly and you're just losing five six 7 10 psi over the course of a month if you don't have a way to look at it you could find yourself in trouble and if you do know what it is and you can't fill it well that's not going to be great either so just take it seriously I rarely rant and lecture on these things but it was super important if you're on the fence don't be get yourself a portable compressor these products as well as most products on our website are eligible for our member

Marine surge Protection Systems have just come out with a new flagship model and it's completely revamped is it worth it though come along with us I'll tell you all about [Music] it before we get started make sure to like And subscribe this video here at mobilus have.com we are changing things up a little bit at the tail end of 2024 and moving into 2025 and one thing we're going to be doing is giving away quite a few products that we show as kind of featured new launch products here we tend to get these samples and we don't always have a place to put them so we said you know what we're going to give them away so make sure you like And subscribe on this channel and in subsequent with videos Andy my partner in crime we'll be discussing how this model right here which is their Flagship 50 aamp model will be given away to a lucky subscriber we're going to be providing chapter links below so you can skip ahead as needed but uh I want to show you kind of the old Flagship model that's right here and this is actually the unit that came out of my RV and that is still in service today it's been with me for over two years at this point and as you can tell they kind of largely look the same even kind of the the plastic quality the fit and finish and I got to be honest I'm not very nice to this thing so it is a testament to just over all before we get into the new model how the build quality of the Hughes Auto former power Watchdogs really is second to none as part of what we do at mobilus have.com we look at a lot of products and we also look at a lot of products that look really nice on the outside specifically a lot of the stuff that's made in China and that you see on Amazon but when we crack that case and we start trying to look at you know is this thing built to UL specifications we start to see some pretty scary stuff especially in the surge protection World um improperly gauged wires badly designed circuitry components that really are not designed for the US electrical market it is kind of surprising how bad uh a a unit can be and be called a surge protector and somehow make its way onto Amazon so please be careful and I highly recommend you go with a name brand unit even if it's not power watch doog so let's get into this new model and kind of talk about whether it's worth it to be honest with you when I started and I heard about this and I started looking at the marketing material I had a feeling that I probably wasn't going to upgrade my existing unit in my RV a part of that was because I have a victron power management system that gives me a lot of the Remote Management capabilities that you'll see this thing can do and partly it was just like well it's kind of the same thing so why I'm proud to say that after I explain some of the features that I'll show you uh in a minute I actually think I will be upgrading my RV to one of these and let me tell you why one of the big differences with this new model is they've kind of changed around the form factor and they've given you this little door here that is actually where you put your 50 amp plug or 30 amp if you're looking at a 38 model uh that will feed out to your coach and I didn't really think about it that much when I was looking at the pictures um to be honest when I looked at the pictures this looked a lot wider and larger than the unit I already had so I was a little worried that it was going to be bigger and I was like I don't really like bigger cuz I have limited space but going into the dimensions of kind of what we see here the old unit was around 5 1/2 in kind of widthwise by about 8 and 1/2 or so and I'm going I'm kind of rounding up uh on the tall side and around 4 in on kind of the the width there um if we look at the this unit um it's you know five and 3/4 so it's basically the same size maybe A4 to a/ inch if you you know kind of count these screw bump outs very similar in size and yes it's 10 in so it's taller in this direction but because you're not dealing with this pigtail on the exit side it's actually quite a bit smaller um I wasn't really factoring that in when I looked I mean this is 18 18 in plus another this is like 30 in Long the old model and the new one's coming in at about 18 to 20 so considerably smaller and it's it's actually smaller on the height as well this one's less than 4 in um height being on my table right now um I guess that would be width or depth um here so all in all while it may look bigger in some of the marketing pictures they've actually slimmed the unit down and because you're not dealing with that pigtail coming out the bottom um it's a lot smaller to store so we hinted about some of the feature improvements of the new Power Watch Dog um let's talk about what it definitely has um that the old one had so this has the emergency power off system where if it detects something um in the power you're going to have your EPO shut off for emergency power disconnect that's a nice feature it also has the serviceable components in here if you were to experience a large surge you can replace that module for you know about $30 and they will actually replace it for free in the first couple years during the warranty period I believe it's for the first two years um so that's a really nice touch you get that with both the Old and the new models both units conform to UL standards we'll put the specific UL standards in the listing page and both units have Bluetooth meaning that you can use an app which will'll show you there to monitor the systems I can't stress how important this app is when you're diagnosing power problems at a campground or when something changes with your power consumption or what's going on I love using this app when you get into understanding how RV power works you'll understand that there's two kind of legs or input power points that sharing neutral and the balance of those can impact kind of how your RV operates now with both devices you have your doggy face here that is your Watchdog and if this is white you're going to be fine and safe and if it's red you're going to get an error code here and you'll have a list of what that means right on the side of the device or you can just open up your app and it's going to tell you from there you also have a nice warning light here right on the front of actually both devices that tells you when you have a um a missing neutral which can be very very dangerous in an RV park so they want to put a specific light there as well because it also with a Miss Missing neutral can impact how the device sees other errors codes so it's sort of like a fail safe to say hey there's something wrong with the neutral you know make sure you service this before you plug in your RV that's really where a lot of the similarities kind of start to stop and you start to see the new model really Come Away with some really interesting features there's kind of three big things that I want to tell you about that really separates the new generation or generation 2 from generation one the first one as we talked about briefly in the beginning big differentiator is the form factor so what we've got here is our power input Port is now covered and protected in a more weatherproof area so that's going to give us a bit of a better uh situation between where our kind of RV contacts coming in from RV and our street power are connecting together they've done a really nice job here and there's a nice cover here that covers the plug to keep dust and other things out and right here it's kind of hard to tell but they've actually installed a neoprene gasket here on the 50 amp plug to f further insulate this and keep your contacts protected from the elements then one thing you've got here when this flips down is the power wires can exit from there but you now have the ability to essentially put a very small or basic lock you could just put a St it's got actually a pretty nice hole size in there you could put a standard you know master or whatnot lock right here and that's basically now locking the power protection system to the cable coming out of your RV um now that's optional you don't have to lock that but it does give you an added way to lock this system up to keep thieves from kind of quickly stealing this or taking something else yeah could they technically cut your main feed wire in yes that's possible with really anything and to combat that they actually do have this secondary lock here this is a locking point and Hues has a cable lock that you can use to lock around the pedestal if you zoom in on me close check this out if you flip this up this little thing here that's a light it's so smart so basically when you're here and you're trying to connect this wire up and it's dark you're like oh you've got now a light that's coming out of here for you to be able to look at what's going on with this plug now that light has come in so handy it's actually helped me hook up my bluek water filter systems just having a little extra light out there has been great I actually envisioned myself probably just leaving this shut and possibly leaving it locked and just using my power reel to put this in and just stowing this in front of my power reel and just leaving it as a single accessory so I don't have to continually pull it apart um that was a little bit harder to do with this model Because by the time I added in my power cord which had another head going in the other direction I was like 36 or 35 Plus Ines long it was just too big to do anything other than like throw in a bay which was really messy this will actually fit much nicer in front of where my power reel is allowing me to not have to disassemble this every time I move but um whatever your setup is this new form factor I'm really liking the next major feature that this adds is Wi-Fi in addition to the Bluetooth now if you're a mobile must have customer and you have some of our peplink or Ram link products you're traveling with a wi-fi system that is essentially always on or at least always on when you're parked at camp with a device like this you can take advantage of that that always on wi-fi system or if you're parking your RV at your house and you have Wi-Fi at the house you could take advantage of that as well I personally think you want to have this connected to the Wi-Fi that you're always traveling with so you don't have to set it up more than once by connecting the Hughes autof forer to Wi-Fi you're now opening up that 30 or 40 foot of range to anywhere in the world where you can access that information what essentially happens is this device connects to the Wi-Fi in your RV you know through a Wi-Fi solution like ours and then it connects to the Hues cloud system that syncs the information on this device to the app now there's no there's no fees for that it's really nice that they've just opened that up to their customers and it allows you to see a bunch of information about what's going on inside of the inside of the power system in your RV it also does push notification so it will alert you if there's a substantial change in the power system and that is most important when you're not in the RV you want to know what's going on with your power if you've got pets if you've got um well if you've got an RV that you care about and you want to know when the power shut off and there could be problems ahead your batteries are going to go down who knows what having Remote Management and access to the power system is really key in addition to the wi-fi system Hughes Auto formers and the new Power Watchdog Gen 2 has added an additional feature which is the ability to actually remotely turn off the power coming out from this device to the coach now keep in mind if you don't have a battery system in your RV turning off the power could turn off the internet which would remove your ability to access um your device remotely to turn the power back on so that's what that warning tells you but for most folks who have house batteries and your internet is always on with your house batteries simply turning off the AC input means that your inter will still work and then you can turn it on at a later point now for me what I like to do because I have a lot of solar on my roof is I can actually use that onoff feature when I'm in uh areas where I'm getting a lot of sunlight and I don't want to use the park power especially if I'm paying for it and I actually just remotely turn on and off the power and rely on my solar instead in addition to those major improvements of the new form factor the Wi-Fi and the ability to remotely power on and off the system there's also a nice touch here they've made the dog uh LED here smaller I didn't really think I cared that much um until I opened up a campground in New Hampshire that has to be what's called dark sky compliant um and that means that we need to keep our Park nice and dark to be respectful for everybody who loves to look up at the sky and see all those beautiful stars this puts off a lot less light now they've kind of heard from customers that the white aspect of it was a bit bit much and there's actually a feature inside the app where you can just turn off the light completely so they've added in a a relay or a way to turn on and off the light for an added benefit I know some folks like to turn off the light um as a theft deterrent you know I don't want to advertise that I have this nice expensive surge protector so that is a nice feature they've added now I have to admit I have left my power Watchdog out on the pedestal uh pretty much forever and um I wasn't even really aware that there was a potential that water could Ingress into this system but uh Hughes does sell a a bag for this for like really wet and Clement weather to protect the system there is a potential for water to Ingress into the Gen one system um and that would not be covered by the limited lifetime warranty if you have a an environmental issue I think a lot of folks like me travel to where it's warm and maybe we're not seeing as much rain which is why I haven't seen a problem with the Gen 2 system they have greatly improved the the uh the weather proofing in the system and that has done away with um the weather bags and all those things and they've basically said this is um going to be fine outside in whatever weather you throw at it the Hughes power Watchdog Gen 2 is in stock and shipping now and for our members this is eligible for your member discounts so this is a way that

{"id": "S3tC4Iw3s3o", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "0i1P4pwHmUbA4QpBa4zkHfiFId4", "transcript": "hi guys this is Andy from mobile must have in this video we're going over the trio flat Mount lineup come [Music] along we're going to go over kind of all the different options you have with the trio flat Mount And if you're new to this particular lineup this is going to be a basically a flat Mount system that works with the starlink Gen 3 one the one with the kickstand or we have options for the starlink mini if you have the one with the pole that rotates I'm sorry these aren't going to work for you but we do have other options you can check out at mobus have.com if you're on the gen two DISH now what's great about the trio flat Mount lineup is you have a couple options based on what might fit best for your installation what trio flat Mount is all about is allowing you to mount your starlink dish basically flat on a Surface whether that's top of an RV top of a jeep top of your truck um and allows it to be as flexible or as permanent as you want and then there's a couple different options within that again based on your installation type now almost everything for in this video is going to be exactly the same for the Gen 3 version and the Mini version there are going to be a couple minute differences but nothing really that needs to be covered in this video almost all the accessories are the same but there will be different versions so if you're going with the Gen 3 route or the like the larger Standard Version make sure you get the right accessories for that they are slightly smaller in different sizes in some applications for the starlink mini so just keep that in mind if you're ordering just make sure you get the right accessories for the right uh for the right Mount now I wanted to go over quickly kind of the two main mounts that are available for both uh both starlink options the first is going to be your traditional uh Trio flat mount mount itself and I've got it in black and in white they they have both variant options and this will just click in directly in to your starlink um on the back you'll remove the kickstand it slides right in and this is a really great option and has tons of different mounting solutions for you so you can go with the magnet mounts and that can go right onto like a metal roof like it works great on the truck um but if you're putting that on a RV roof that's non- magnetic or even an Airstream that's not a magnetic surface you might need something that's going to be like these metal discs and that is something you can stick down to any surface you want and then you can have your magnets adhere directly to that so that would be another option to get the magnet mounts oh this are so strong can't even get them undone uh you have other options too like your suction cut mounts if you want something um a little bit more temporary or you're putting on like a sunroof or something like that the suction cups are great and these are the ones you actually pump out the air in to really make sure they're on strong so that could be another really good option now you do have two more permanent options the first look cover is this disc this is something that would adhere directly to the roof itself and then it would basically mount to the to the system like this so they would be basically directly held on and much more permanent this isn't really a removable Mount then um unless you're removing the whole system so that is an option too if you're looking for something more permanent or if you have more of like a custom rack uh on a lot of Vans I'll see custom racks or roof racks you can do a direct mount with just screws and bolts there is a direct option as well with the bolts just the bolts basically included uh if you go that route you are going to also need which comes included basically a release lever this allows you to get behind the starlink and uh basically release where the clips are since you can't remove the mount itself so that's going to be a quick high level of all the different mounting options you get with these two uh different starlink antenna options now if you'd like more information you'd like to see all of these kind of in I have a full video going over the accessories I don't mention the starlink mini because it wasn't out at the time but all of those are going to be the same basically for the flat Mount itself now if we jump to the speed Mount that's what this one and this one is here in front of me those are going to be much lower to the roof so if you're going really at highway speeds anything over I i' say these mounts are good at like 65 miles an hour they're really good if you have them behind an air conditioner something that breaks up the wind but if you're going directly into the wind on the top of like the pickup truck and you're going at interstate speed 75 80 M an hour you're really going to want to look at the speed Mount options these make it almost flush with the roof very very little air gets underneath and they're just designed to handle the wind a lot better uh these are really designed to work with the magnet mounts specifically um and that's because um the way the footing is to get it really low to the ground um you can do that you also since it's so low to your surface it's really hard to get it up um and removed so if you're doing something with a direct bolt there's really no way to remove it if if you're direct bolting it to the thing because the Starling sits on top of this flush and then all you're mounting is up underneath the mount itself so the Magnum mounts are definitely the preferred option with this but if you needed something custom you kind of are getting a flavor of what options are here to work with for all these particular amounts now these are really really great Solutions what we like about this is this now allow ows you to do a semi-permanent install of starlink itself and you don't have to worry about setting it up each time you go to Camp which is a huge real disadvantage we see with starlink in general is every time you move you have to set it up tear it down store it um and us coming from the peplink uh LTE 5G world where we're not used to that I just don't have the patience for that anymore so we have just our Starling permanently mounted and it works perfectly now few things uh we get a lot of our comments is now when this is mounted to your roof you are no longer at this designated angle that the kickstand provides and yes that is true uh it is not the optimal angle but we are seeing very minimal impacts on speed tests as we have driven around with these to see if that's working so it's still a really good option even though it's not at the optimal uh angle it it still should perform more or less seamlessly um when mounted another great option though too is now that these are potentially uh temporal barly mounted let's say from magnets if you are somewhere where you're parked under a tree or somewh where it is blocked you can just remove it you can just pick it up you can put the kickstand back on the bottom as it just slides in place and then put the starlink out further away from from where it's located the trio flat Mount system just allows you ultimate flexibility with your starlink so you can use it now there's recent recent updates where they're including in motion now with some of their new roam plans and this now can allow you to get a better use of that in motion um and allow you to mount it in a way that it will still work and be secure while you're in route so that can be something else to think about now here mobile must have we're all about getting you the right type of internet connection for the right type of traveler for a lot of those for a lot of us that are working on the road having redundant connections and multiple ways to get connected is absolutely critical starlink is great but it does still have its its weaknesses with it being something you can't put under a tree um or in general sometimes you do have to set it up and you just aren't in a place where you can set up starlink or don't feel comfortable leaving it out having a backup system or something that works seamlessly with starlink can be a huge benefit and that's why we always recommend pairing knes with peplink routers peplink routers are certified to work with starlink you can Absolut you can normally completely replace your your starlink router with a peplink and your peping rounder can even control a lot of the settings in your particular starlink it'll tell you when there's outages um it will store or Stow I guess the Gen 2 dish if that was something you needed to do um and there's lots of different features and functions built directly into the peplink router to optimize your performance out of your starlink antenna and with peplink of course you're getting that cell your backup built into your system so if starlink wants to be your main connection that's fine and then you want to have a failover into a 5G connection or 4G connection you could even look at our new rink carrier plans that way you're going to be connected to whatever carrier is in your area and then you can have starlink be your primary or your backup option depending on what you're looking for so being connected on the road is all about being flexible having multiple options at your disposal and knowing what kind of is going to work best for the situation you're in starlink is definitely a great option overall but we we know it has weaknesses and there are a lot of times even I traveling week by week as we do you know about 50% of the time I'm having issues with Starling due to some obstruction or where we are or speeds because everyone else is using it so so being able to flip over to 5G can make a huge difference and really save movie night you know when it's really important for us uh finally uh not part of this particular video but if you're looking for a DC power conversion for any of these particular uh mounts we have those as well so check out all of our solutions for starlink I'll link up above to our store and the starlink specific section at mobilus have.com um we do have DC power options for the mini for the Gen 3 and for the high performance dish if you're looking for that as well now if

{"id": "F1cQcVnEVZY", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "YUBwogxudzx_YTKko479w8d-Qw0", "transcript": "hey guys this is Andy from mobile mus have in this video we're going to do an unboxing of the rink connect [Music] solo now why unbox this let's talk a little bit about Rome link Rome link is a new wireless carrier wireless provider that mobile mus have has recently launched as of August of 2024 and we're super excited about it R Link Wireless runs on all four major carrier Towers Verizon 18 T-Mobile and US Cell what's great about this is you only need now one plan to get access to all those different networks on top of that the ram link Network itself is prioritized over typically a lot of the carrier plans so you're coming in at a very high priority you're going to have very fast speeds across all major Towers in the US so unbeatable coverage now with Rome link and uh and then you have great priority now you have lots of other good benefits month-to-month plans 7 day money back guarantee warranty supports included lots of cool stuff I will list the website here you can go learn all about rink Wireless itself now we have a lot of people though that are looking at ways to get access to R Link Wireless but they don't already have a compatible device as of right now you can go get a r link plan just as it is but you need to have a peplink device if you don't have a peplink device ROM link connect which is what we're talking about in this video could be a really good option for you there are a couple different Hardware options ions couple different plans I covered all of that in a video I will also link here if you want to get the roming connect overview this video I just wanted to show you a quick unboxing um and kind of what you need to do when you get R link and what you need to do yeah to get it out of the box so we've unpackaged the main things we need there's a couple extra things in here uh like cable management um and other other power accessories depending on exactly which model you get um but for the most part all we need is the device itself you need your antennas and a power cable um I'm first going to go and attach the cables oh and one thing I forgot is our uh sticker which we'll get to in a second uh now I'm going to attach the antennas now for this particular model this is the solo um you have two different antennas one for Wi-Fi and one for LTE this is going to be very similar on all of our models but the antennas might look slightly different uh just make sure you're getting the Wi-Fi ones on the Wi-Fi and the LTE or 5G ones on that if you look at the antenna itself on the bottom it will say at the bottom that says Wi-Fi and then there's Wi-Fi ports here you can also confirm with the actual connectors one's mail one's female and then the other ones they swap it so it's hard to get these in the wrong spot so just make sure you spend at least a second or two making sure you got the right ones on the right slot as far as which one they go in it doesn't matter you just need Wi-Fi on Wi-Fi and sell on sell okay almost done now I like to angle these slightly apart So the antenna can see that the or the tower can see that there's two different antennas there and then the Wi-Fi is up for the best range possible and now we just need to plug it in all right now if it's the first time this device is out of the box it might take an extra minute or two to get connected um and what we're looking for is right here next to the power port there's going to be a status a Wi-Fi and cell we're looking for a solid green on status and a solid green on cell and that's when we know that the router itself has connected all right and just after a minute or two I'm now seeing all three lights at a solid green uh and now we're just going to connect to the Wi-Fi to test and see how it works um for this particular example I'm just going to kind of show off the the barcodes here here going to record my phone screen all right and then I can just hit join ROM link as it's in the camera if you don't even take a picture just hold the camera over it hit join and then if I switch back over to my settings we then see it connects to R link and then those four digits now if you're trying to connect this to a laptop or something that doesn't have a camera TV you can totally do that the Wi-Fi name is on the stickers with a password if you can't find the stickers or you lose them over time no worries they're on the back of the router itself too so now at this point I just am going to flip over to do a quick speed test let's just see what the network is and how it's performing in this particular location you can see it connects to roming wireless uh we get a pretty good ping rate and about 20 25 down maybe 30 yeah so that's a really solid connection again this is just a solo this is just kind of our entry level package this router I have seen up get up to 100 megabytes a second so it really just depends on what tower you're connected to how busy is it what is being used in the area is it super saturated I can tell you in the evenings we're usually seeing slower speeds on any device not just ring on any device because everyone's using the internet then same thing with starlink same thing with everything so this is definitely enough to get through through a zoom call get you through FaceTime calls check your emails do anything you need to stream movies this is more than a enough and again it's going to work on every single Tower more or less in the United States you got Verizon towers AT&T T-Mobile and US sellers so you've got great reception uh and and now all in one package I just wanted to add in a quick note that a lot of this is about redundancy and stability of the network so while although this particular speed test on the solo isn't necessarily the fastest you could get if you were doing like a 5G connection you're going to get really stable connection so that your Wi-Fi is not going to drop you're not dealing with rebooting this device is designed to stay online all the time and stay connected so there's a lot of benefits when you look at the peplink hardware and what you get out of that combination with good strong hardware and uh RAM link Network that has access to just about everything I'm in a new location filming this clip and I did another speed test and this is the test I got here so you can see it's all about location and just keeping you connected no matter where you go if you were looking for something that you wanted a bit more better reception maybe you are constantly going out to doing you know state parks national parks you're really on the edge of coverage it could be a good idea to add a a bigger antenna to this these will work great they're about 400 times the gain of a phone um these particular pal antennas so they're already going to give you a decent boost but you can get more we have window mount options they call the peplink slim antennas they literally will suction cup to your window and get you even better reception and if you want to go super Advanced you can always look at something like a roof antenna like the parseek Husky or something like I have installed on my roof those are all compatible with all of our R link connect devices if you do have any particular questions or wanted to dive in deeper on anything definitely leave a comment below we're making rink videos here every week talking about topics getting the word out about our new network that we're really excited about if you have a specific question and you want to go over that with somebody on staff no problem you can email us directly at info@ mobilus have.com and we will respond to you on that or or you can go to talk. mobas have.com and set up a phone conversation or consultation and we will call you back uh so you can set up a time that works for you and you can get a one-on-one with one of our representatives to walk

{"id": "mnKFMcLmk4I", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "RyktUZzGVFqETN1nLBDmgwVdcXs", "transcript": "hi guys this is Andy from mobile MAV in this video we're going to talk about R link connect and how that is getting you the best mobile internet into your RV for a very low [Music] price now as I mentioned we're talking about rink connect in this particular video I want to go over some Hardware options you get with rink connect what is rink Wireless if you haven't heard about that yet and some other fun details kind of all play in together getting you the absolute best internet connection in your RV now first let's talk about what is Rome link and ROM Link Wireless Ro Link Wireless we are very excited that mob must have announced in August of 2024 it is our new uh virtual mobile network it is an mvno it is basically a new network that we have created specifically for those who travel voters rvers any W nomadic that needs to stay connected rink is specifically designed for those of us who travel um it works off all four major Network carrier Towers Verizon AT&T T-Mobile and US Cell no particular order uh it is designed for Mobility so it works while you're in traveling while you're in route while you're driving it works under trees you can work inside buildings just like any other cell plan this is going to work in a lot and a lot of locations and now with an extended coverage of basically every tower that there is almost uh you get absolute coverage everywhere if you then add a roof antenna or extended range instead of just the paddle antennas you can really really extend that range to make it virtually impossible to not have signal as I've seen traveling around in my fifth wheel it is so hard for me to find a place that doesn't have service nowadays even in some national parks and state parks and places we really like to visit so R Link Wireless itself is a great plan if you already have a peplink and are interested in R Link Wireless you can just get the data plan you don't have to worry about any new hardware um that is available on our website I will link that here it is rink.com rlink has a lot of great features everything is going to be month-to Monon so there's no long-term contracts you get a 7day money back guarantee like I said it runs on a huge network of all four major carrier Towers um there is unthrottled speeds there is priority network access so you are not going to be slowed down just because the tower is busy uh there's lots of cool things about rink Wireless so if you're new to that I'm also going to link our launch video for that if you want to know more just about R Link Wireless itself now this video is about R link connect we have a lot of people that are reaching out to us that want access to Rome Link Wireless but don't have a peplink already if you've purchased a peplink from us you can just get the plans if you've purchased a peplink from someone else that's unfortunate but I will those plans will also uh Ro will also work on those particular pings as well uh if you are in the market for a new device you can absolutely come to M mus have purchased something like a bundle or a particular router it stays unlocked it is yours to own you can use r Wireless you can use another carrier whatever you see fit but if you're looking for a r link device specifically that's where R link connect comes in we have a few options that make it really easy and inexpensive to get started on R link so now let's talk about rink connect Hardware as there are a few options um it's first kind of set up into two main tiers there's going to be a solo and a Duo so solo and a Duo solo is going to be a single modem so one connection one Tower one carrier at a time um connection this is a really great starter device this one in particular is the r link solo there's also the rink solo 5G really the only difference is one is going to have 5G compatibility one is focused on LTE other than that they are both the same so you're going to have a single modem uh where you're going to connect to one Tower one carrier at a time and as you move around or as something happens to where the coverage might have changed it will keep you connected based on what is available in the area it does not necessarily do that as you're staying so if I'm parked here it's just going to keep me connected to what I'm connected to so that way if I'm working or on a zoom call it's not going to drop me out but as I move it will constantly be trying to find the next best signal and keeping us connected this is a really great option for just about everybody um especially if you're retired or don't need a lot of internet but just want to stay connected something simple this is the way to go the roming solo uh we just dropped the price right now it's $99 for the hardware um kind of setup fee and then you just get to pick your monthly plan the 5G is a little bit more expensive that is $2.99 for the 5G upfront cost and then it is what again whatever data plan you select after that now for all of the hardware here the solos and the Duos it starts as a rental program meaning we mobile must have will retain ownership of the device we manage the device you don't log into the back end or anything we control all of that um through that now if you are a active subscriber for a year uh or more we will unlock the device and then you get to keep the hardware totally optional but if that is something you're interested in after a years of service we will unlock the device for you you can take it anywhere you want to go you can stay on Ro link whatever you're looking for but it's a great way to get into this because now you can start with peplink hardware and the best data plan there is for $100 plus whatever the monthly service plan that you pick is it's a great way to get started if your plans Chang or whatever reason you don't want to keep R link for over a year no problem just let us know you're ready to cancel and we will send you a label to return the hardware and we will deactivate your plan and the subscription so just make sure you kind of keep this in the best case you can um for that particular return now I wanted to talk about the rink connect Duo and really the Beast this device is for working Nomads now don't get me wrong you can absolutely do a lot of work on the solo and the solo 5G those are really great options but there are some people that require just a little bit more redundancy than that they're doing podcasts they're doing really important Zoom calls they're doing live streams they really can't afford their internet to drop out for any particular reason and this is where this roelink connect Duo comes in the best thing about roming connect Duo is its multiple connections to the internet at a single time with it being a dual modem you get two active connections two different networks at the same time and then you can Bond them together to make it so it's a hot failover situation so if for some reason a tower goes out or it loses power or whatever you're going to stay connected through that second connection and that's what makes the redundancy so ridiculously cool on this particular modem in addition to the actual failover and that you just get better bandwidth having two active connections just like if you have a single Lane Road that's congested because of a lot of traffic when they make that a dual two-lane road you're going to have a lot more throughput more cars can get through they don't necessarily increase the speed the speed Li might be the same but you can get double the amount of cars through that's what happens when you go to a dual modem device so this device is really designed for those who are working on the road need that extra layer of redundancy and it's very important for them to stay connected now I personally traveled with this particular device um managing my own network so I multiple different SIM cards and this was absolutely a game changer going from a single modem device or even something like starlink that can just drop out just kind of randomly at times it doesn't happen when you're on a dual modem so that's what's really cool now the the pricing for this is $4.99 so if you were to do a Duo the starting price for the hardware is going to be $4.99 now that is a big difference if you were to go out and purchase this device this would be about $9.99 um and some of the newer models are $11.99 so you're getting this more than half off if you were uh you know if you were to look at this to purchase this outright so it's a great way to get started uh in a dual mode on device if that's what you're looking for now I wanted to take a quick minute and talk about data plans now data plans are going to be something that is just kind of constantly changing we always see carriers going through different plans and they that changes basically the wholesale side so if you are watching this video kind of a hot minute later definitely check out the latest information I'll post here on pricing there's a link there that takes you to the live pricing page we always keep updated um but this video if you're watching it in September 2024 sometime close to that this is going to be the information that should be pretty accurate uh we'll start with the solo so the solo has three plans you can choose from the first is 100 gigs and that is going to be $100 pretty pretty straightforward uh there is a 300 gig plan and that is for $159 a month and there's an unlimited plan at $1.99 a month uh so those are your three plans for the solo now for the duo it has two plans and remember for these plans they are dual modem so you're going to have two active connections with both of these plans the first is going to be a 500 gig plan and that is 1999 and there's an limited plan and that is $249 uh with both of those speed Fusion is included um and with everything here warranty and all that stuff is also included in these devices so that's kind of the price spread um as of today for these two devices there is one huge feature we haven't touched on yet that absolutely needs to be discussed and that is starlink integration rink connect is compatible with starlink and is specifically designed to be a plug-and playay starlink solution now what I mean by that is you can take your starlink you can plug it directly into the WAN port and you will then immediately and automatically add that as an active internet source to your roam link device on a Duo and you ad starlink you adding a third source of Internet to this device that will automatically be added to your speed Fusion tunnels and designed specifically to help you with that bonding this can be a huge difference if you see those starlink dropouts on Zoom where everybody freezes for a couple seconds this will actually pick up those throw that over sell when starlink is trying to figure out which satellite it's on and then immediately pick you back up uh where you left off without you even noticing it had to do stuff in the background uh so this can be a really great option now specifically if you are looking to add R link to your starlink setup um the best options are going to be the duo it's got the upgraded processor for that last and final thing is I wanted to give some thoughts on roming connect here at mobile mus have my testing with it overall and expectations and I have been very very pleased kind of seeing what we've been able to create with roming connect uh for the rvr I so I meet so many people on the road that just get confused or have a hard time setting up their devices and that's been kind of a stress point for them or overall has been stressful to manage and the whole idea of rolling connect is to completely remove that stress point and and concern about your internet with access to all four carriers you're going to have internet just everywhere it's going to be hard for you to find a place where it doesn't connect anymore and that could be a good or bad thing depending on what type of RV you are so that makes it really easy there's also now zero like software setup you have to manage if you go buy one of the uh systems right offline you are going to have to worry about setting up your inter your Wi-Fi and setting up your access to the back end and there's a little bit of configuration it's not that bad um but if that's something that is concerning and you just you can't do it Um this can be a really great option where literally all you have to do is plug it into the power source and you can get online so we're really excited that we're able to bring a peplink solution that is designed to work in military grade applications and out at Sea this is what Carnival cruise lines are using to stay connected is this peplink hardware and bring that down to uh a normal rver someone like myself and bring this technology down that's really solving a lot of the in the connectivity needs that we're all experiencing if you are a member of mobile musthave uh you get your membership discounts on these so you'll get your 10% off the hardware fees and then you get $10 off a month off of the data plan fee uh that is um as of right now it's a $200 annual subscription usually the math works out to be absolutely worth doing that so that is a great option now if you have any questions about R link we have a couple options one is I'm fascinated to know what your questions are if you have something specific about R link connect or anything we talked about in this particular video leave a comment below love to engage with you there a lot of people have the same questions you might have so leaving a question in the comments down below might help someone else get their answer too and I do my best to kind of keep up with those um so definitely leave a comment down below too if it's something more involved or more engaged or you just need more help with something specific maybe for your use case please reach out to us on email here is info@ mobilus have.com that is a great way great way to reach out to us but some people just like talking on the phone and really want that personal connection too we have that option as well I'll put a link here on the screen um you can talk. mobil.com you can go to there you can schedule a time we will call you based on what works best for you and we will set up a consultation and we'll talk basically through what the difference between Ro link and internet bundles are and do I need a roof antenna and what's based on my kind of RV what might be the best option for you we're here we're here to help you uh definitely reach out if you've got those types of questions as well if you have any technical questions about how the stuff works definitely reach out to us on email and that probably a better place for us to kind of go back and forth and explain maybe more detail if you had any questions that way too all right guys thank you so much for hanging out with me on the video can't wait to see you guys all connected on the road bye [Music]", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2024-09-16T15:25:29Z",

{"id": "p0E9gPikL80", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "_KCvY7vpmuknMs1u_cP7EFyjLGA", "transcript": "there is a new mobile data carrier option available for those of us in the RV and travel space that works on every cell tower has prioritized data High gigabyte data options and so much more and that's what we're diving into today welcome to roelink hi guys this is Andy from Mobile musthave in this video we're talking about the new wireless network that we at mobile must have created called roelink I am really excited about this video as this has been a project we've been working on for probably a year or so and just finally kind of bringing it out into the open is just like turning in a big final exam for us here at mobile must have but not only that we feel like this is really solving a big problem and a big gap we personally have been experiencing that this is now solving now in this video we're going to go over a lot I want to do a deep dive into what is Rome link how it works key features and functions and all that kind of stuff so I will break this video up into different sections down below uh so feel free to click through that if you need to jump ahead or want to skip back to something that's going to be your chapter markers there so first let's talk about what is ROM Link Wireless um and some kind of some details there so rink Wireless is called is an mvno a mobile virtual Network operator so it's an official Network operator now we don't have and own any of the infrastructure we are going to be working off of existing infrastructure um but we manage all the network stuff after that so how many gigabytes are in plans uh what plans are available are they throttled that kind of stuff um what's great though about R link and one of its first key features is it works on every uh Tower so we're on Verizon towers AT&T Towers T-Mobile towers and US cellular towers so you the coverage you get with one plan is going to be extensive you can't get anything better than that not only that remember this is now 5G and LTE connectivity so you can park under trees inside covered buildings and stuff like that and still get coverage with this particular plan so that is a huge benefit here with also being our own dat our own network carrier we have a lot of flexibility in data plans and throttles and all that kind of stuff too um everything I'm saying here is going to be relevant as of basically Q3 so September um of 20 24 that said a lot of this is probably going to change as we get feedback based on what kind of plans are available or people are looking for so definitely go to rink.com if you want to see the latest information um about anything we can talk about in this video so the first category I want to talk about is what is ROM Link wireless and what does that mean and and how are we saying we are a ress carrier well rink is registered as a mvno a mobile virtual Network operator so it is just going to as official as mintmobile as boost um what are some of the other ones that were out there Metro PCS stuff like that stuff that ran on other networks those are mvnos R Link Wireless is exactly the same thing register the same way all of that uh now the networks that R link runs on is very extensive so it's Verizon AT&T T-Mobile and us cellier we use the towers for all of those carriers to get you connected but as soon as your data hits the tower we are managing basically the traffic throughput so the throttles and the gigabyte speeds and all that kind of stuff that means it's very very flexible and mobile must have has a lot of control over basically what that Wireless plan or carrier is so that's the great news is we have a lot of control over it and we can provide the best service for rvers which is our main goal and travelers and boers and stuff like that that uh we can so that's what's really excited about roic Wireless and why we fought so hard and kind of created this network for us now let's talk about some features and benefits within R link I I have so many I've got to keep them on my phone because there's there's just too many to go through um around what Rome link is and what Rome link offers the first is going to be prioritize network access this means you're going to have the fastest speeds available from the tower there's no nothing slowing you down there's the Network's not slowing you down the networks not saying anybody gets Data before you do you on R link are going to be the prioritized kind of data stream so that means you stay connected faster at those faster speeds and if they're going to slow someone down they're going to slow down probably the carrier direct speeds first um and you're going to be the last one slow down now there are going to be times where this network might be a little slower if the tower is super saturated um that we can't do anything about that Tower is going to be slow but you are going to see the faster speeds last the longest with that higher with basically the highest prioritized data on that Tower we've already mentioned this too but you're going to have unbeatable coverage with ROM link we run on the Verizon AT&T T-Mobile and US cellular towers so as long as you are in cell range in general you're not having a particular plan as long as you are in Tower in range of a tower you are going to be connected which is just been mind-blowing as I've been traveling around the summer testing this plan uh next is designed for mobility and I say that is then you can use this in motion without any extra charging it's just LT and 5G just like your phone you can use it in motion you can use this under trees you can use this inside buildings uh it is much more flexible as far as how it's connected just like your phone is connected to a a cell service so is roaming it runs on the same technology uh depending on what you're putting it into you might actually get way better coverage if you're using a roof antenna we've sold a lot of those or you're using like a window mount antenna you don't want something permanently installed or even just the peplink pep links have four times the antennas that a phone does coverage wise so you can get some really good coverage with r link for better than what you're used to on your phone uh all of our data plans including R link will come with us-based support so if you ever have an issue you can't get something connected uh you can reach out to mobile must have and we will get you sorted support is included as long as you have an active plan with ROM link R link also is available over eim or physical SIM card this is greatly expanding the accessibility to the r link network if you have a device a peplink device that was purchased probably within 2023 and 2024 most of those are eim compatible so that means you can order a ram link plan and within a couple hours we can have it activated for you completely remotely if you have an older device or you just want a SIM card in general too that's fine you can buy your R link plan order a free sim card with it have it shipped to you and then you can have Rome link available via VIA the SIM card uh both have advantages the eim can be instantly activated which is fantastic uh the physical Sim is great because you can move it between one device or another if you have multiple uh pebbling devices or you just you move around a lot uh that is also an option so both are free you can go eim or physical Sim they're both included uh but just something to keep in mind and last is flexibility so there are no contracts with ROM link it is purely month-to-month you can sign up one month and turn it off the next there's no annual contracts or anything there's also a 7day money back guarantee uh now you got you can't use a ton of data and then say you don't like it because that doesn't make sense but if you don't use a lot of data and you're within your seven days you can absolutely uh say you don't like this anymore and return it for a refund so we're all here about customer satisfaction making sure that what we say is true in these videos is actually true um as we've doing you know we travel ourselves this is what we do to stay connected this is the same technology uh we expect and and hope you guys are enjoying as well now let's quickly talk about plans and pricing my quick disclaimer here is this information is probably going to be the one that changes the most out of this entire video um as this might change seasonly based on what we have available to us um also and based on feedback from our current subscribers is what is they're looking for um and all that kind of stuff so I'm recording this end of August 2024 um as so that's the that's the date on this video if you're watching this quite a bit later definitely check out ring.com for the latest information uh as of today we're going live with two main plans it is going to be a 100 Gig plan for $100 and a 300 gig plan for $159 now remember this is prioritized data this is all carriers uh there's a huge list of benefits from this um and so yeah so we're really excited about launching with these particular plans these two plans will work on every peplink router you can do that with eim or with a physical Sim depending on what works best for you so those are the plans available today now I do have two additional plans available but there is a hardware limitation here if you have a dual modem device that was purchased 2023 and more current um it most likely will work here's the official list uh I'll put on the screen um and these are going to be Fusion Sim compatible routers we have Rome link available plans with larger uh gigabyte options so a 500 and an unlimited plan option are available with these particular uh device options now these larger plans will still run um some data through R Link Wireless directly but we are also able to provide larger amounts of data through other networks and sometimes carrier direct plans that are offered through Fusion Sim it's all still virtual um Sim technology it's all still remote now what's great about the 500 and unlimited plan is it is going to be a merge of kind of both roam link and carrier direct plans carrier direct plans are great because you can get really close to actually true unlimited options in some cases and you can get that then on like let's say the unlimited plan uh but then you get the benefit of having available Rome link data for when you're in a place that might have kind of low coverage and you just want to stay connected you can then use R link to stay connected in places that are a bit more let's say sketchy on the carrier coverage side but then when you're in a place with good coverage um and you just need a lot of data maybe you're like a YouTuber that's uploading a lot of data like this video I will use something that has a lot more data available and that's when kind of fusion Sim is great to kind of plug in if you want to learn more about Fusion Sim I'll link a video here it's not the main point here but you do have basically for this video you've got four different plans you've got a 100 Gig a 300 gig option and then if you have a fusion Sim compatible device you also have access to a 500 and an unlimited plan option we'll do more about Fusion Sim plans later if you have questions about that please leave a comment down below and we'll definitely make sure we cover that in a future video now a lot of us watching this video we're going to have already purchased our pep links and have our bundle set up with the roof antenna and power and we're just looking for kind of the latest and greatest best data plan um and that's what R link is for if you're looking for either a supplemental data plan or a primary data plan ROM link might be in probably is going to be your best option based on coverage and data and all the things but there's a lot of people that might not have a peplink um and are still looking at ROM link and looking at the best way to get basically a full internet package a complete solution per se and that's what rink connect is let's talk about rink connect for a few minutes so rink connect is as I said is a full plug-and playay hardware and data plan solution um that it comes fully configured so you don't have to worry about setup you don't have to worry about configuring a device or anything all you have to do is take it out of the box plug in the antennas plug it into power and you're all done there is a way to scan basically to get on the Wi-Fi if you're on a phone or a tablet and it will automatically connect you to R Link's Wi-Fi um but if you have a computer and need to do it the old school way it's on the back of the router too uh the Wi-Fi name and password and that's it there's no configuration there's nothing you need to do you just need to put it on power put it behind something on the TV or hang it up on the wall license secure now you're all set up with rink Connect Now rink connect does come with a small uh upfront rental fee uh and then it is the same monthly price as the rink Wireless plans uh so all the plans we talked about earlier in the video exactly the same price um for this although there is a different page if you want to learn more about Roman connect I'll link that here now last in this section I wanted to share some of my personal feedback based on rink as we've been traveling kind of throughout the Midwest um the last couple months uh with rink testing it as we travel around um I have been very pleased with rink it has kept us connected everywhere we've gone and the speeds have far exceeded every other plan even starlink that I have on board um it is actually to the point where I am going through way too much data too fast because the speeds are insanely fast and incredible on rink it is almost too much of a good thing um there have been multiple times I've have tested 700 down um or 600 00 down and I'm in the middle of like Montrose Colorado in the middle of nowhere getting 700 down on a 5G connection uh so definitely too much of a good thing there was one day I went through 10 gigs alone I didn't even think I was using the internet and we went through 10 gigs um so I say that as in there are lots of things you can do and yes it's great to have a fast Network um and get 700 down it's super impressive to see on your speed test but that means you could be going through data really really quickly um and so something to keep in mind of uh the other thing that's been great about rink is I am typically parked under a tree it has been very hot out here in kind of the the Colorado mountains so we have been dying for shade this particular summer and I would say three uh weeks out of four in a month I find myself under a tree you can see I'm even fight in the sun now um and so starlink for a couple months I literally just turned off um because I couldn't use it where I was parked um and so having Ro link and having a stable 5G LT connection has been really nice to not even really be concerned that starlink is or isn't working now I am personally running on a br2 so I am running a 5G connection um and that's where I'm seeing if you're going on an LTE router something with like a cat 12 I'm still seeing upwards of 100 megabytes a second um on cat 12 or like just regular 4G LTE speeds so you are still seeing really really strong fast speeds on LTE even without 5G and that's why I mean rink is just going to be really something that's beneficial to people that need good coverage and need decent speeds where they go but yeah almost definitely too much of a good thing with the speed test because I was recording some videos and going through 10 gigs of data just doing speed tests um to kind of get some coverage and footage and and stuff for social media so um definitely watch that video where we show you how to manage your data best you can with ROM link and get all to it we are super excited that ROM link is here and available now to be used if you are interested in signing up for any of the plans I've linked a bunch of pages below I'll link

now the trio speed Mount is a flat Mount uh for the starlink Gen 3 antenna this is different than the uh Trio flat Mount you've seen earlier but made by the same company um but this is going to be the speed Mount Edition now the main difference is this is going to be ultra low Pro profile there's not going to be any wind getting up underneath the mount or a lot less wind um but it uses all the same accessories so if you uh want to learn more about the accessories I'll link a video for those as well um but this is going to be a quick guide of basically how to install it around your antenna how how to kind of connect everything and then a few tips and tricks about it now like I said this is the trio speed Mount so this is going to come in basically four main kind of parts that you have to put around your antenna it makes shipping really easy and cheap overall so it's great you can do that it is four screws it is not a complicated install by any measure but there are a few tips I wanted to pass along before you get too far along and have to redo or undo it like I've had to learning um this particular product overall uh couple things I wanted to show is before we get this there are like water runoff holes um I'm going to show this on my phone here so you can see what that looks like and this allows like once the antenna is there so no water will sit along the antenna overall um it has a nice Groove It kind of attaches into and there are pieces to it that uh there are numbers so from my point of view and I'll switch the camera here you've got one two three on the right and four on the left that is going to be how this thing kind of pieces together um it comes with the four bolts you need to connect everything and with the little hex driver you need as well now the first tip I'm going to give you is do your mounting bracket first because once the antenna is installed it is so close to the bottom you can't do any screws or anything um quick review of our accessories you have the suction cups these are heavy duty suction cups you pump the air out super super duty you've got more of the permanent adhesive ones um you have uh the magnet mounts which is advised for this particular Mount and then you have other things like swivel or basically a direct install the problem with this one is if you do something that is permanent you can't get the antenna out or it's almost impossible to get anything up because everything is basically on the underneath so doing something like the magnets where it just will suction down and then you can pick the whole thing up and redo it if you needed to or gosh the the starlink had a war warranty or something you never know if you do something permanent where you're really sticking and adhering something down uh that would be harder to get it up so for today I'm going to go with the magnets that just slide perfectly in here but you can if you needed to do one of these other options as well they will all fit in here um but I think the Magnum mounts is really where this one is designed so all right so at this point I'm going to install all of my magnets okay now that we have all of our magnet mounts installed I'm going to spread these out just a hair and drop in the starlink now it is important to get the orientation correct you've got on the second corner piece is where the cable Dropout is so you want that to be where the cables going um and then I always found it easier to start actually with number three and push these in and then go number two or number four it doesn't matter really at this point just because of the way the little uh flaps are and then number one just slides in easiest then since there's nothing going behind it and now at this point you're going to take the included screws the bolts are already inside the frame and just make sure everything is nice tight and connected together okay and there you go so now we have everything attached it's not going anywhere and man this looks really Sleek on the top too because you just have the total white finish so that looks really really sharp uh now I'm basically I think I'll take it to the truck and let's see how it sits on my rooftop so I will admit I already see one potential problem with just my particular demonstration is these particular ridges um they might prevent well no look at that so overall even on The Ridges it sits quite well it is popping up a bit on this side if I got it on a ridge it might sit better so again something to consider but this is what it looks like fully installed it is definitely lower profile uh if you compare it to the flat Mount that they originally came out with um and you can see here this is where the cable is going to come out of so that would be the back of the antenna looks really sharp it is you know on the ground you would have a hard time seeing this especially if I centered it man these magnets are so strong they're hard to get up and yeah that just looks real sharp Up on the Roof uh but that's what looks like you can see how hard it is to get up it is possible to get it up um but it it just it's it's really seamless now the holes are great because they will like I said allow water run off there is four on each side but this is what it looks like installed there you go and just final thoughts I will do I'll show quickly here a comparison of what the flat mount looks like on the roof and then you've seen what this one looks like just if you want a comparison of kind of the height differences um and just the overall comparison I think it's just it's a fair view um if you guys have any questions about uh the starlink mounts here the trio flat Mount or the speed Mount or any of the accessories we talked about in this video we are here to help we have a support team and customer service team that is ready to answer any of your questions you can reach them during kind of 9 to 5 Eastern hours or 9 to 6 Eastern on chat uh that is going to be just

to travel with starlink really low profile and I think it really opens the options uh for what you can do with starlink you can now put it anywhere even on the top of your truck all right guys hope to see you all on the road bye [Music]", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2024-08-29T21:25:43Z", "channelId": "UCE9KnGK2TcpXLlIi5cQfGvg", "title": "Low-Profile Starlink (Gen 3) Vehicle Mount - TRIO Speedmount

{"id": "Ix2dQWu5v-4", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "uCiwyie2LSFPWllIvEqDgY8QrU8", "transcript": "hey guys Eric with mobilus have.com and today we're going to talk about DC powered options for starlink high performance dishes there's a lot of stuff on the market we've cut through most of the BS done a bunch of testing and have options for you to get your starlink high performance dish powered without using an inverter come along with us I'll tell you all about [Music] it now today's video is going to cover the starlink high performance fixed Mount dish now that's the larger dish that is known because it can be mounted on a RV or marine application has kind of a wedge Mount to ensure water goes off of it and it's designed for inmotion use if you're looking for DC power options for another dish like the standard starlink dish or the actuated dish or the new mini dish that came out hit the Subscribe button and make sure to click that Bell we are going to be coming out most likely with some additional op options for that as well but today we're going to cover the HP dish now I installed my HP starlink dish over a year ago and it's been a GameChanger for me in the mobility space in terms of receiving mobile internet I pair it with my Cellular Connections with my peplink router and that allows me to have starlink but also be able to park under a tree and because it's fixed mounted I don't have to set up anything it really is the perfect mobile internet solution and again subscribe cuz I'll do a video of my latest 2024 2025 internet setup because it's been a few years since I did a full walkthrough of my setup I can drive down the road using my HP dish there's nothing to set up I'm not going outside I'm not running wires through slides or Outdoors or tripping on them or any of that stuff that we see common with traditional starlink users I also because I pair it with a peplink router which is a cellular enabled device I plug my starlink into the peplink and now I have cellular and I have starlink and they can be used at the exact same time by combining those connections or one at a time depending on how I want to use the internet what that means is I can drive down the road I can go under a bridge I can park under an overpass I can park my RV under a tree my starlink goes out and I don't notice that the internet is out because it automatically fails over to Cellular conversely if I'm in a low cellular area and there's no self signal my starlink takes over or I'm able to use both at the same time and it just means that I feel like I have reliable home internet use one of the major disadvantages in my opinion about the starlink kits in general is that they require AC power the same power that comes out of a wall socket in a traditional home now larger RVs and most RVs actually nowadays will come with inverters that will actually take power from a battery a 12vt battery and step it up to wall power that's fine and that can work but you're in inverter has to be on in order to power your starlink and in our opinion internet is something that sort of should be on all the time especially if you walk away from your RV and you want to monitor stuff or you've got you know remote access to lock the doors or whatnot you want to know that your internet is up even when you want to turn off your inverter to preserve some of the power in your house batteries that's really why we feel that the starlink needs to run on DC power in an optimal fashion for Mobile use in order to run the starlink high performance fixed Mount dish on DC power we've have two different options that work for different use case scenarios we'll call one of the kits the cut option uh meaning you got to cut your starlink cable and we'll explain why that might be something you want to do and then our second option is the no cut option where you don't have to cut any of the factory starlink cables to get your dish running on DC power before we talk about the various kits we're going to kind of give you a summary of what to expect in terms of how you're going to wire this regardless of which kit you pick they have very similar wiring and setup instructions other than that final cable that goes up to the dish now the starlink high performance fixed Mount dish uses or can use a lot of power especially if it attempts to enable the snow melting feature on the dish when that that occurs the dish can operate north of 250 it's actually 280 to about 300 watts of power when it Peaks at its maximum power usage now the dish doesn't typically use that much power but it is why traditional kind of power over ethernet Solutions like just plugging your starlink into a Poe switch or something will not work it's a technology that needs a lot more power than you see with traditional networking applications because of this we need some beefier Tech to get things going now the first thing we need to do is we need to have a step up converter and what that does is it steps up the power from your 12vt batteries up to 48 to 56 volts which is what the starlink dish runs on all DC power if you're in a marine application or if you've wired your RV to run on 24 volts you're in luck our DC step up and converters will run on either 12vt in put or 24volt input and output the same required 56 Volts for the dish to power on and operate in DC mode one of the things you may notice that's different about the mobile musthave kit is we run our DC stepup converters at 56 volts not at 48 volts just about everyone we've seen out there on the market is running a 48 volt step-up converter because quite honestly they're cheaper to buy and they're more readily available we special order 56v converters because that's the upper range of the voltage that's accepted by all of the the accessories here and by the dish by going to the upper range of the voltage we're ensuring more that if there is a longer run of cable or if there's a slight voltage dip for any reason the dish isn't going to reboot itself and knock you off the internet so we use a 56 volt step-up converter um technically you could use a 48volt step-up converter but the most important thing to note about these converters is they have to be um of the correct wattage um or amperage to operate properly now a standard one that you might see on eBay for 15 bucks or something is probably going to be about 100 to 150 watts and as we said before this dish is going to operate 250 to 300 watts so you want to be above that now the the converter that we've sourced is a 280 wat converter and this works great with the starlink HP fix Mount dish I've been running this converter and this setup for over 3 months in my bus and it's been working flawlessly so it's a great setup that we've tested so that you don't have to now as part of your purchase you get detailed wiring diagrams and access to our support department if you have any questions but at a high level what you're doing is you're going from your 12 to 24volt batteries to the input side of your power stepup converter and then your 56 volts outputting to one of your starling link adapters we'll talk about that next and then you're coming out of either the cut or the no cut kit into the dish and that's it we'll also get into wire sizing and recommendations towards the end of this video so make sure you stay tuned but now that you understand what a stepup converter does converting the voltage that your battery runs at to the voltage that your starlink runs at let's talk about the different options for how you can DC power that starlink high performance dish starting with the no cut option which you see here there are three main components that come into the kit first you have what's called a Poe injector and this is injecting power over ethernet into a standard ethernet cable it's actually not standard this is a category 8 cable we'll get into that in a minute but essentially all it means is it's very fat with a lot of copper inside of it that can transmit all of that power that the dish needs and this cable does come included in the kit everything is labeled as you can see here and it shows you where you put your voltage input your 56 volt input from this converter and it will come right into these standard inputs down below now this also has an integrated surge protection mechanism that will protect uh the equipment from surge as well by grounding right here with this ground screw down to the chassis ground in the RV or marine application it's a nice touch there to protect everything in your kit you're bringing your power input into this side and then over here your Poe is going to Poe which is labeled to Poe on this adapter now what this adapter is doing is it's converting your standard ethernet cable Port here an RJ45 Port over to the starlink cable that comes down from the roof on the HP dish that's what this box does the net effect is quite simple you uh plug in these cables right here your Poe matches up to your Poe as you see here down from here that will go up to your starlink dish this is your power input from your DC step converter and then here where it says Lan that will go to the WAN Port of your peplink router and you're Off to the Races running yourself on DC power now it's important to note that DC powered kits like this are designed to work with thirdparty routers uh typically like peplink routers this is usually a setup that's designed for someone who's going for a bit more of an advanced setup but there are pretty entrylevel routers from peplink the the B1 um is is an example of one that's at a very low price point you know sub $300 price point and can give you the ability to combine multiple Starling dishes add cellular down the road and a bunch of other options the b15g is uh little a little bit more money but adds a 5G cellular modem and then you can do all those things I talked about earlier like combin starlink and all that stuff now why would anyone want to go with an option that required you to cut the cable in your starlink dish which um obviously you can't return it and you can't uncut a cable um so honestly the vast majority of folks are going to want to go with the no cut kit it's simple you don't have to cut anything you're Off to the Races and you can run DC power but the the people that are going to be interested in the cut kit might be folks that are not going to be happy with the 75 plus feet of cable that is included in the starlink dish High Performance Kit as of Summer 2024 they've upped the length of that cable to accommodate certain customers probably in larger yachts and other Marine applications but for van lifers and other folks in um in RV applications all of a sudden you've got this massive cable that's about as thick as an old K cable TV wire like an RG6 cable for anyone over 30 and um and if you've got 30 plus feet of that that's bundled up somewhere because you didn't need it it's just a lot of stuff to try and bury in a cabinet that's really where the cut kit comes in so what's included in the cut kit well this box is virtually identical I mean it literally looks identical um other than the color of the anodized aluminum what you're going to get here instead you still have your land port here that's going to go out to the router and you still have your Poe Port here that's going to go up to your dish but you're missing the adapter that's going to convert the cable end uh of this unit up to that dish but in replacement of this you're going to get this now this is a category 8 um termination end so once you cut the cable and you carefully remove the eight pinned wires that are inside of it you can actually open this up and without any special tools it's one of the kind of really cool things that we noticed in this kit you can open this little adapter up and press down each of the wires on this punch down terminal that's inside of this kit and then once you've got them into that area you can lock them down with this little lock kit here that'll push them into locking into the terminals close this and complete yourself with your ring this has got to go onto the cable before you assemble the entire thing and the net effect you take off this little safety cover here is that you now have a standard ethernet cable end with the correct pinouts to plug yourself right into the poe input here to go straight up to the dish so this is a way for you to get rid of all of that extra cable and still DC power your Starling fixed Mount roof dish whichever option you choose is really up to you both of these kits are available at mobilus have.com we'll put links Down Below in the description and you can kind of pick whichever one is best for your use case but now we're going to go on and talk a little bit about kind of wiring considerations and how to get all this stuff working choosing the correct size wire can be confusing for folks and it can be very confusing to understand how to wire all this stuff especially in a way that can be super safe now a big consideration in your installation is just how far from your battery Bank your house battery Bank are you going to be placing all this stuff and as a general rule you want to place this as close to your batteries as possible while we understand that if your batteries are all the way at the bottom of the coach or boat and the dish is all the way at the top you may have some challenges so you kind of have to work it out based on the length of the cable and what your installation requirements are I'm going to go with sort of a general worst case scenario of you being between 25 and 30 ft away from your battery Banks where you're going to be installing that stuff and as a result I'm going to recommend some larger wire than you may be used to seeing at your kind of local you know auto part store now this stuff we don't sell wire at mobilus have.com but I'll put links to where you can pick up some wire the marine grade specific wire that we'll talk about in this video and uh it's very it's pretty inexpensive right now so it's not going to break the bank too much depending on your installation requirements but if your batteries and these boxes can be closer together and you can run more of that starlink cable that would be a better option because the starlink cable runs at that 56 volts Which is higher which means it can go further on a thinner cable all the other stuff in your kit is running at 12 volts or maximum 24 volts so that's going to need thicker wire the lower the voltage the more resistance the bigger the wire you need to prevent heat and a potential situation where you could put yourself in a in a dangerous situation where a wire is melting or something like that so again we're going to be talking about worst case scenario now for my installation what I have done is I've run8 gauge marine grade duplex wire so what you see here this is actually 10 gauge 10 is a little smaller than eight I ran eight so eight gauge is a really good middle-of the road size wire that'll let you go from your battery Banks to a remote location up to about 30 ft and still give you uh enough power to run something like a starlink high performance dish and a few other low uh consumption devices like a router or something else that that uh wouldn't you know take that much you know a router typically is like 15 watts or something like that so very little power this little handy fuse box here we sell at mobus have.com this little clear cover comes off and you'll see that there's uh positive Terminals and negative terminals here and then these are all positive and these are all negative for secondary Branch circuits to come off of so just giving you the high level you'd come off your batteries you'd go into this is rated for 100 DC amps at 12 volts so I'd likely put an 80 or 100 amp inline fuse on my 8 gauge wire right down by the battery that's going to protect the wire all the way through the walls and then I'm going to plug into this and I've got my Negative black wire here and my positive red wire here and that uh is going to fire this guy up so that I can add secondary fuses from here off to things like my DC converter so for my DC converter I would do uh a 30 amp um fuse at 12 volts if if I was running 24 volts I would cut that in half cuz my voltage is higher so my amperage is lower you don't have to get crazy with all that but that's how that work so I'd run a 15 amp fuse if I had a 24volt battery system and that would go into the input on my converter here now that would uh allow me to then have five spaces available here for other stuff so as you can see with pictures of my setup I've got you know my router and other uh 12vt things that are all running on this little fuse box what I love about this is I also have red lights here that will pop on if it notices that one of my fuses is blown that can be really handy I also power cooling fans off of this um so if I've got like a warm cabinet uh this just having a little load Center that's what these are kind of called Somewhere remote up where all of my tech stuff is has been really helpful and it's uh it's a very effective price point especially if you're going to go through the hassle of running this cable uh anywhere far from your battery bank now the starlink HP dish requires a lot of power and this DC converter uh can consume a lot of power with a maximum output of around 300 watts and because of that the manufacturer has included some Power Protection Systems that have actually caused quite a few problems for folks on our Channel who plug this thing in to like 11.9 or 12 volts and it doesn't turn on and they think it's broken it's not broken uh but it will not turn on unless it notices a minimum voltage of north of 12 volts I'll put the specifics right here um and note that it will also turn off if it notices a minimum voltage so if you're going to install a DC system and you want it to work well and you want it to not create heat on these wires or a potential issue you want to make sure that you have adequate batteries you know you got to run healthy Good batteries batteries and you want to make sure that you're running adequate wire from those batteries to these accessories and properly fusing everything as a final fail safe if you don't do that and you have too much voltage drop which will occur if your batteries are not healthy if your batteries are dech charged or if you ran too small of a wire this little guy won't turn on uh and the reason for that is to protect you to protect you and your kit it also means that if something were to go um you know you're drawing down your batteries and that same battery is used to start your generator this will turn off it will also turn your starlink off but it will ensure that you don't come back to a fully Stone dead battery because you forgot to turn off the starlink kit as mentioned before we have full wiring diagrams on kind of how to set this up how to set up the cut version and inside of each of these kits you get a small wiring diagram that kind of gives you the overview of how that works as well but we recommend check out our wiring diagrams that are included um at support. mobilus have.com because

{"id": "LBoAyyL2O8s", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "CIw3c1mjxgsMhk1sla33ZzXU4cU", "transcript": "peplink multicarrier TurnKey internet that you can use with eim or with a physical Sim it's here it's called Rome link it's mobile mus have's new wireless brand come along with us I'll tell you all about [Music] it hey folks Eric with mobilus have.com and I am so excited to tell you guys about Rome link I've been working on this for years so I will get right to it okay at the core what is rink R link is multicarrier uh internet that works on all of the carriers inside of the US Verizon AT&T US Cellular and T-Mobile I have roaming agreements with all of them and it works with all peplink devices we previously launched a version of our multicarrier plans called the M series plans and we will be continuing to use our Fusion Sim technology to augment our Rome link product but R link is really the flagship that is taking over our multi-carrier internet solution so how does Rome link work and what really is R link we are operating as a true what's called mvno or mobile virtual Network operator meaning our name is right next to the signal bars just like you'd see with like a mint mobile or something like that and we are managing the traffic everything from basically when it hits the cell tower on all the way out to the internet is managed by mobilus have.com by investing heavily in developing our own mvno and all of the relationships and stuff required to do that it's not fun uh it allows us to give you a better product Rome Link Works via physical Sim uh meaning we'll mail you a Sim one of these mobile mus have branded Sims or via eim which we can activate via in control as long as you have a valid in control subscription that's a limitation of peplink in order to use the eim technology at the time of filming this you need to have in control uh it's not a limitation of R Network or um of Rome link but that's just something to note but even if you don't have an eim com compatible router you can use their physical Sims and that'll operate and get you connected to R link plans are always changing but at the time of launch we're offering up to 300 gab of data on any peplink device uh on our Rome link data plan so no matter how old it is where it came from if it's got a cellular modem in it you can activate R link and get up to 300 GB of monthly data uh per SIM card obviously you could get multiple Sims if you want to Stack above 300 gigs if you have a fusion Sim capable device meaning a Transit Pro a br2 um a the uh the balance 20x uh we've got a full list of devices that are uh capable of supporting Fusion Sim that unlocks our 500 gbyte and our unlimited data plans as well so lots of options for everybody you might be curious to know what all these boxes are what's with the boxes are you selling routers as part of R link Yeah we actually are we are launching something called R link connect which is a fully managed platform it comes with the Rome link data plans like we talked about you can pick the plan that you want and and you get a rental router as part of that purchase there is an upfront um device rental fee that is typically less than 50% of the cost of the router that you're getting and then you get access to the Rome link data plan and we manage the router for you we're going to do a separate video on Rome link connect um which I can link to right there if you're interested in R link connect but it's a way for you to get access to these data plans get a device that's fully set up that you don't have to figure out anything about that's ready to go out of the box and that you can return when you're done with it one last thing about Rome link connect is if you do keep it for 12 months we will give you that router free of charge it's a nice plus and then it's unlocked at that point you don't have to use it with ram link Service uh although you can continue to if you want but you can go ahead and go anywhere you want with that device and it's yours to keep with Rome link your device and the cell tower work together looking at signal strength and a number of other factors to understand what network to best put you on if one Network's not available it will automatically fill over to another Network and there's nothing to do now if you have an issue with a particular Network and you're spending an extended amount of time in an area and you want us to steer traffic to a different network because you're having connectivity problems we can do that we're not steering traffic just to steer traffic for folks that would clog up our support department um but if you're having an issue where you're seeing speeds that are unacceptable we can stare you in another Direction device itself does a really good job of making sure you're on the right Network I've been driving all around making sure I have connectivity and it's fast uh our network is set up extremely well and it's very fast we are um working with the cellular providers in that they are providing the cellular towers but as soon as we're done with the radio frequencies and we're past that initial point then we are taking over the traffic there and it's running and operating on our Network that means we have our own ex our own APN we route our traffic through our own IP addresses out to the internet um there's a couple reasons why that matters it's it means that it's not really possible for the cellular providers to deprioritize our traffic so what I'm finding in our rink plans is they are extremely fast often times much faster than um some of the kind of unlimited plans that you see direct from the carriers that are always subject to deprioritization but also that they just really work extremely well in a variety of different areas because of that multicarrier functionality we expect these plans to be incredibly popular we're endeavoring and saying on our website that if you purchase it by 2:00 we will look to activate that device same day uh worst case it's in within 24 hours we'll get you activated on an eim profile and we as always we'll get SIM cards in the mail if you order by 2m to get to your destination and you can pick whatever shipping preference is best for you based on how quickly you need that data plan Rome link comes with our no questions asked 7day money back guarantee we ask that you just keep your usage to under 20 Gigabytes that's more than enough to try out the service give it a shot see if you like it and with Rome link there are never any contracts and everything is month-to month you prepay for your month you're good to the end of that month and you can cancel your subscription at any time with Rome link we're also offering Travelers the ability to pause your subscriptions and lock in the rate that you have from the time of purchase so you know we you know some carriers say you can only pause you know once or twice a year we let customers just pause whenever they need to pause it it's perfectly fine your bill will essentially revert to a $10 a month plan and uh the service will not function function until you tell us that you're ready to turn it back on but you lock in your rate you don't have to worry about reactivating anything and you're good to go for that $10 a month pause plan rate we're super excited to launch R link with a number of different plans from 100 GB ranging all the way up to unlimited uh if you do uh have any suggestions for us if you'd like to see a different plan now that we have control of the network it's very easi for very easy for us to build plans as long as they're economically feasible so we're open to suggestions if you want to reach out and have any suggestions about something that you don't see on our store R link will pretty much for the foreseeable future that I can think of always be about mobile internet uh we're not a telecommunications company we're not looking to do phone uh type traffic or anything like that we may open up uh Rome link Beyond just uh peplink devices CU we can technically run them on phones but not right now what we want to do is we want to get the network launched and we're really comfortable with peplink Hardware we know it works we know it works well we know it solv so many problems that people have regardless of their network if they're trying to use a phone for internet connectivity or a tablet it's it's just not the way that we think you really should do it if you want to have the internet work like reliable home internet so if you want a lowc cost solution look at ROM link connect if you already own a peplink device check out ROM link and the M series data plans with rink um there's just it's it's every carrier for one low cost with no contract and a lot of gigabytes at a very fast speed as always thank you so much for joining if you have any questions about anything you can reach out to our team you can hop over to mobilus have.com start up a

{"id": "QcnZ9vtH7cE", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "s087nPZOX1s7Bg4-CH14pDLCg3o", "transcript": "hey guys this is Andy from Mob musthave in this video we're going to go over the trio Mount accessory options that go with the trio flat [Music] Mount now if you haven't seen the first video that we talk about the trio flat Mount itself what it does and how it works with the Starling gen 3 definitely go check out that video I'll link it here in this video I wanted to go over the five main mounting options you have with the trio flat Mount um to give you kind of a better understanding of really what your options are now the trio flat Mount has been a great accessory for the Starling gen 3 dish this is the one with the kickstand um and basically it allows you to mount it in much more places in a permanent or semi-permanent option so you can remove the kickstand that comes with the starlink dish and you place the trio Mount basically right where that kickstand is now how you Mount the trio Mount to something is what this video is all about there are five main options we're going to go through I will put chapter markers below if you need to jump to a particular one that you're looking for or want to go back but that's what we're going to go over here so the first one I'm going to go over is the one I already have installed on the trio flat Mount um in front of me and this is going to be the magnet Mount option it is four round discs that are basically screwed right through the trio Mount frame itself and they are high-powered magnets um I drove around with the starlink working on the top of my truck and it stayed on perfectly through highway speeds and was uh a really surprising option they were actually quite challenging to remove not impossible but they are not going anywhere is the main point there definitely a really good option now the second option with the magnet mounts is to add the mounting discs you're still going to use the same EX act magnet feet but the mounting discs will be four circular metal discs with an adherent VHB basically tape on the bottom you can stick on something that's not magnetic or like a rubber roof I think that's a really good option if you're going to install something on like like a fifth wheel or my RV that has that TPU roof that way you can stick those four circles down and then adhere this really anywhere you want even if you're on top of an Airstream and want to do it that way you can use those metal discs and get same kind of functionality of this magnet Mount without having a metal surface there's a few other options as well though uh the next one is going to be a little bit more of a permanent installation with these landing pads or Landing discs these will Mount directly onto the trio flat Mount as well but they're they're not as removable the only way to really remove these is either to pull up the tape or to unscrew your Mount if you really wanted to move it much more of a kind of more permanent installation um these also come with the release lever since there's no way to really get the antenna up and to get access kind of underneath it you need the release lever to release basically where the trio Mount connects into the stand itself so it will come with the release lever so you can get access um to remove your antenna if you ever wanted to bring it down if you're parked under a tree where it's currently Mount wanted to move it that's a good option there the next option is going to be the suction cup now you'll notice these are a little bit more expensive but these are some serious suction cups they work really well they are they're not like just kind of stick and go you're actually going to put these on the surface you are looking for again the top of a car would be a good example or maybe Marine applications might be good and then there's a little pump you're going to use that pumps the air out of where the suction is and then of course there's a release valve as well if you want when you're ready to release these so you get four of them and then you use the same screws to mount it to the base of the trio Mount itself this is a really good option too if you're looking for something um on a non-magnetic surface that is still smooth um this could be a good choice just make sure whatever surface you are using your suction cups for are going to be designed for that so whether it's it needs to be like a solid paint finish uh glass or or like a a smooth metal I know some people are using suction cups on the fiberglass like on the RV behind me me and it can work if you have the right polish or the right finish on it but they also can kind of lose their suction over time so just make sure you're on the right surface if you're going to go with a suction cut Mount the next option is going to be these through bolts and while although they're quite simple it's just basically a long bolt with washers and nuts it also will come with the release lever the release lever is important because you won't be able to get underneath the starlink antenna itself to release it from the mount if you ever need it to move it service it warranty it whatever reason so the basically the fancy stick is going to allow the perfect angle to release the tension of the trio Mount and the antenna so you can remove that if you ever needed to and the last one is going to be these swivel mounts um pretty clever in the sense that they will again Mount directly onto the fleo mount the trio Mount but they are going to allow a lot more of a curvature so if you're putting it somewhere like on the corner of an Airstream maybe that's your only spot due to solar panels or something and you really got a strong curve uh these mounts will allow these this basically this to swivel so you can get a really rounded shape if you want that then you you will can attach these to the magnet mounts or anything else so this isn't necessarily a complete solution these swiel mounts but they're a good mid inum if you're looking for something else and know you've got a curve from a curve standpoint this is a semiflexible but not really it's pretty rigid overall which is good um so it has a little bit of a flex to it if you're trying to get it on something that's got a slight curve but if it's a pretty decent curve you're definitely going to want the swivel mounts to really give you that overall flexibility if you guys have any more questions or want us to look at an install and see which options we suggest just reach out to us on chat or shoot us an email at info@ mobilus have.com and we're happy to give you our guidance on what might be the right installation type for you with the trio Mount option since I don't have a way to show like a permanent install I'll show you with the suction cups what the release lever is for and basically you're just going to push it up underneath there's a Groove and all you're trying to do is just kind of pull the tabs that hold this down and I find if you just kind of push forward a bit more that's what releases it the plastic is flexible enough to to do that without snapping um which is great because the starlink one is really rigid and breaks pretty easily the kickstand version uh but this is great and then it comes right off and you can see the suction cups didn't even falter with that and then to attach it it's all about sliding the start Ling back in you'll hear it click again not going anywhere so just been pushing this in and I just kept slowly inching this forward until it released and then boom yeah I'm just checking all of these to make sure that didn't impact them and yeah they're all nice and thg still so just like that now I'm going to release the starlink antenna again slowly just release it Forward I pull the starlink itself just kind of forward off the mat put that here on the truck and then to release the suction cups it's just kind of pinching the sides poof poof and poof so there you go and just like that all done now if you've got questions on any of this or want to learn more or have a specific maybe detailed question please reach out to us we have a full support staff that is here and ready to support you uh with any questions you might have on the trio mount on the starlink mounts anything you have on we have on the store you feel free to

{"id": "dzFc9snIVqk", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "S623z3qVfIAUR4_279zmhoX7sUk", "transcript": "hey guys Eric from mobilus have.com and today I have some exciting news we have been working with blue for a little bit and talking through whether or not a 10in water filtration system would be of interest to customers it's not for everybody but it's pretty darn cool and it comes in at a very very low weight so it's definitely a true blue product come uh along with us I'll tell you all about it [Music] hi everyone thanks for joining us and uh this right here is the uh the ARX series you may have not seen this as much on mobilus have.com WE focused pretty heavily on the Mr series which was uh the full stainless series but we'll talk about this anodized aluminum version that is kind of where blue is going in the future and you're going to start to see more and more of it at mobilus have.com this one right here is the ARX uh XLT uh kind of like XL because it is bigger and this is the first uh filtration technology that blue has taken on that brings in a 10-in filtration technology filter so we're talking about the same level of water filtration technology that you experience in the 5 in filter systems just brought up to the 10in in height for those that don't know when you talk about 5 in or 10 in we're talking about the height the diameters of these filters are the same and uh they're basically a 2 and 1 half inch diameter filter so none of that changes so bigger is better right I need bigger filters that's better well blue really has kind of blown up and exploded in the RV Market because anyone who has a big water filter knows it's heavy and annoying and a pain in the butt to change and we don't necessarily use as much water in the RV systems as would be kind of beneficial for a big filter like this so the vast majority of rvers really are going to actually be better served by a 5 in filter by the time that filter gets used for you know a period of 3 to 6 months stuff like bacteria can actually start to grow on the filters it due to lack of use and it's a good idea to change out your filters anyway so for the average rver that's sort of just using what we would consider average water use in an RV the 5-in filter is actually better but if you're a heavy water user uh this can benefit you you can kind of get a bit more um gallons overall out of your filtration in a system like this it's not going to create like a groundbreakingly larger amount of flow um the 0.2 Micron it's kind of like a sheet of filtration material and the water's got to pass through it so it's not going to like create a much faster pass through but you will get a little bit of filtration Improvement I think with a 3/4 in garden hose you could see about 5.5 gallons per minute on average out of this system versus kind of like 4. uh five or so out of a 5 in so you could get a little bit better um on the pressure side especially with larger hoses but um it's really going to come down to your water use and how many gallons per week or per month you're really putting through this system to determine if you want to go with the XLT we'll have more on the nitty-gritty about that stuff on our listing page but we want to spend a little bit of time just talking to you about what's included with the irx and some of its specifications kind of to start one of the big amazing things that I talked to Corbin and blue about when he was designing this was our experience with some of the competitive products that use stamped steel um and how heavy they were um the the kind of like top competitive product that we see and you can look at the listing page to to look at comparative pictures uh is around 28 29 PBS for that de for that device it's heavy um and when you're trying to like lift it up into a a storage Bay or something and you do that every single week for or every single day depending on how much you travel it kind of adds up and it can kind of tweak you out so one of my big things was I was like Corbin I want this thing to be light and that's a big part of why we see anodized aluminum here which is much lighter but also we're maintaining the stainless steel where the water is really you know touching what you drink or what you're close to so we still have our stainless steel um filtration canisters we still have our awesome quick uh connect system so this is fully integrated if you have any existing blue technology um but we are adding anodized aluminum and the result is we're talking like I think it's 11.8 lbs check the specifications but it's under 12 lbs so it's less than half like a lot less than half of the weight of the competition it's also small um if I look at just the the uh the housing here it's coming in at just under 15 inches about 14 and 3/4 by uh a smidge over 13 probably 13 and a quar if I'm giving a little bit of wiggle room there and widthwise about 6 and half inches so it's I know it's sitting right in front of me on the camera so it looks big but in terms of a big fulls size 10-in water filtration system this thing is coming in pretty Compact and uh I like what I'm seeing moving on to some of the other accessories we've got this handy bag here this is machine washer um and it can be used you can use the filter what with the bag on which is pretty cool so there's there's little ports right here that you can unzip to allow the hoses to come in and out and then up here at the top you've got a little removable um foam insulating and padding pouch at the top here um which can be really nice um this bag actually can help um if you're like getting really kind of close to freezing or just right at the freezing point to insulate your water system to keep it from freezing we always recommend folks it's pretty simple to disconnect your filters and bring them inside if you're going to have a frost or freeze event so don't risk it because that's not covered under warranty but the bag does provide some insulation so that's a nice touch it's got these little mle um I think that's how you say it uh loops on the front kind of like a military style Loop so you can attach uh things to it and then this uh velcro patch I was like what do I you know I'm not going to like put my like American flag patch here or so I mean I guess you could um but what I thought about was if you get velcro strapping you can actually like stick your hoses to this and it can create a really nice kind of compact thing to kind of put everything away or your accessories so it actually did make a little bit more sense and then you've got this nice handy pocket in the front as well where you can add additional hoses and whatnot to give you kind of a a um a just a handy single place to put everything again it's machine washable if you leave this thing out in the rain it couldn't get a little grimy it's cotton um um and a polyester but I just throw it in the wash and it it comes back pretty nicely moving on to other accessories you obviously get your filter wrench this is how you remove the filters and there's notches all around here uh where you can get attached to those filters and then you can remove them remember when you're looking down at something it's going to be reversed we've had a lot of folks sitting there looking down wrenching going I'm going right it's like no you're actually going left because it's upside down so just keep that in mind I oftentimes will actually put my bag down and then put my filtration system on it like this and actually uh start and hand loosen my filters this way just so that I know the orientation and the Direction moving on to filters you're going to get three filters the uh longevity the 0.2 Micron and the tasty all pre-installed we had them color coated so you kind of had um you know different colors for different filters we were trying to simplify stuff but that's actually created some isues at the manufacturing plant so we said you know what let's just get back to whites and we'll label them so we'll make sure that the labels are on the front of them and they also are physically distinct and look a bit different I've actually got them lined up here in the correct order of where the water flows so this is your longevity you can always kind of tell a longevity filter because it's got these ridges and it really doesn't have any caps on it it's basically like a feels like a like a piece of uh you know rolled up cotton paper almost um it doesn't have a lot of tech to it because really what it is is like a giant filtration uh sponge for like big sand and stuff then you go to your 0.2 Micron which you see here uh you can kind of see these like horizontal cuts through it that's kind of a Telltale nature and then it's got a very broad uh silicone seal here to make sure it gets really strong contact to the filtrational housing and then last with these kind of rounded tops because this canister is full of carbon you see your tasty filter and this is for Taste and those are all included if you're on the fence you're not sure should I go with the 5 in or the 10 in um for the vast majority of folks that are you know rving with two people I would say go with the 5 in if you've got a large family if you're like Andy from our team uh he'll probably migrate to the 10inch uh it'll get him some more filtration life he won't have to change out the filters as much uh with his uh family of five now in that RV uh plus the dog and a cat so there a lot of stuff going on in there a lot of people drinking water so he'll probably go with this model um if you want to get really down into the technical stuff we actually now have this which is a new um really cool accessory from Blue and it's a digital water meter and it's going to actually manage the flow of water and give you a readout of how much water has passed through that hose into your RV system so technically you could pick one of those up first if you're on the fence and monitor your water ation and then decide uh which of these systems you'd want to go with after just keep in mind that that's a quick connect system so you're going to need the associated hoses that connect up with quick connects if you want to use that uh that water meter but it's a really cool accessory that's also um available and works with all of the Blu tech line as always if you have any questions you can reach out to me and our team you can hop over on email and go to info@ mobilus have.com you can hop over to mobilus have our website

{"id": "nBU4LWfkkvU", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "qKsEZMUld2iA9PU3YLpA0mU-HaM", "transcript": "hey guys this is Andy from mobile must have in this video we're doing an equipment upgrade in a class [Music] A now I'm actually really excited about recording this video as it's a new one we haven't done before we've done a lot of installs from scratch going all the way up to our full like bundle installs where you've seen us the roof antennas starlink and then the routers inside um and I'll link a couple of those if that's really what you're looking for this video is more focused on how to upgrade your equipment or some ideas to upgrade your equipment if you've started maybe at a baseline level and are then looking to add 5G or add starlink or you're trying to add and grow your existing connection set this might give you some ideas and that's what this video is about today now the rig we're working with today is a 2019 tiffen Zephyr uh it was a gorgeous rig and I appreciate John for letting us come in and film as we did this install Forum um but what we're what John had before is basically our Essentials internet bundle it is going to consists of a peplink br1 mini um and then he has a 5in one roof antenna uh a pointing roof antenna installed and then all the power was basically already installed all up front uh now some of the new changes he's done since going with ar bundle is he's wanted to add starlink to his mixup so he has starlink in places where cell might not be reaching um and he wanted to better integrate basically his starlink experience into the peplink um and it became pretty clear to me that with a brand new device that was out from peplink this is a good opportunity to one not only show you guys this device and how how it can fit in how it can be installed but it was the perfect device for what Jon was trying to get out and what he was trying to do with his existing kind of setup JN came to me with like two main concerns he was trying to overcome one was uh just general Wi-Fi issues he wasn't having enough Wi-Fi outside of his RV when fully connected so he was trying to stream with that outside TV and just get better connectivity when working outside um but he also wanted to get a little bit faster speeds as he was doing a lot of work with his photography and just wanted more out of the system um and he was on LTE he was on a cat uh 7 router before so moving to a 5G you're going to see a big boost in that to tackle both of Jon's kind of challenges here I broke it into two different kind of sections so first is we're going to do the install of the b15g that will help one get the starlink integration get a much faster speed out of that you'll get the full capacity of starlink and then two it will help um with faster upload speeds when not using Starling because you now have a 5G connection and he's going to be using our new M series data plans which work on all Carri so it's one data plan and you can it just works on any network based on what's available in your area the second is is we're going to bring in an access point move that Midway back in his RV so his Wi-Fi just has a better range as it goes through some of the metal structures of the RV sometimes Wi-Fi range can be challenging depending on kind of what your RV is made from and how that's all structured now compared to other install videos we have done this one has to have been the absolute easiest as all the hard work was already done for me couldn't ask for more all the power had already been run uh all the antenna cables had already run the antenna had been installed for goodness sake and all the ethernet cables that he wanted had already been put in place this was really much more of an equipment install swap um and then getting that additional access point to work um you much more than like our physical antenna installs which again if you want to know more about that we've got lots of videos there too now in the beginning it's pretty straightforward we're just going to remove the old equipment that um we're not going to need at this point and going to be working on mounting the B1 5G it fit perfectly in his front cabinet here it's a very thin kind of lowprofile router it's different than the mobile routers in the sense of its kind of body body design and style but it's still a very slim and Sleek profile router that will work on DC or AC power the only thing the B1 5G Pro does doesn't have that some of the more mobile friendly routers will have is that GPS functionality so just keep that in mind if that's something that's important to you um for us we also didn't want to really permanently Mount anything by adding new holes into any of his existing kind of cabinets or um wall space so we went with uh kind of a heavyduty velcro strip that John had on hand already and this allows him to basically remove the router if he wants to ever actually put a physical SIM card in it or just put it up and down depending on if he needs to do any work behind the cabinet it's not permanently installed to where it's causing any damage it's very easy to take on and off since we're not doing any particular antenna installed in additional to what's already there we can just take the existing antenna and plug it directly into the router as well and of course power is right there uh so we're just going to plug it in now this install is running on AC power uh this is a Tiffin it's a 2019 tiffen Zephyr so it has dual inverters it's got everything you need so we don't need run 12vt in this particular case so we just ran it off the inverter this makes the install of this B1 uh 5G just look amazingly easy as it was it just was perfectly placed right in this cabinet everything was right there now I will take one one moment to note here about the antenna that we've Cho that was already installed and the b15g the antenna isn't necessarily the perfect pair the antenna that was pre-installed is a pointing 5in one uh antenna that's going to have two cell two w Wi-Fi and a GPS our new router the b15g is going to require four cell two Wi-Fi and doesn't have a GPS but we still want to make sure we can utilize basically that antenna when we need it if we're somewhere on the edge of service um and maybe you're covered under a tree and you still need that cell connection you can still use this antenna to uh sell your leaves to the antenna and then plug in two of the regular paddle antennas that will come with the router so that can be an option if you're trying to kind of Jerry rig it with some something that's already existing uh that could be a really great option to keep the install very minimal with the install of the B1 complete uh we are then going to basically Power It Up plug it in and get starlink working as well I like doing this specifically at this point to make sure I'm only working on one piece of equipment at a time so I want to make sure the B1 is plugged in I'm getting the right Wi-Fi uh we've got starlink connected correctly uh and all of that's kind of merged in so we'll plug it in we get power we're going to wait for it to come online and then we're going to do our configurations for John so I will set up the Wi-Fi networks as he likes it now if you're connecting starlink directly to your peplink make sure you go download the starlink module basically inside the the peplink dashboard and that allows you to see and control the starlink directly from the peplink device and also optimizes the traffic from starlink into your router so it's really important to do that as it kind of optimizes your speed and connection if you have any questions about configuring your your peplink in general and our general tips and tricks we have a full guide on this too as I won't go over it here as the guide is always updated with our best practices but definitely make sure to check that out if you have any questions about your peplink configuration and what we suggest when we set up pinks for customers now once the b15g is all completely configured that's when I'm going to move to the access point now I had preconfigured the access point before coming to this install um and we have a full video guide on exactly how to connect these access points to your particular peplink device uh we have it for if you've got an AP controller like this one does or if it doesn't and how you can connect those two uh so I'll link those videos description or above depending on how you're watching the video so you can see that link as well U but with this already configured really all we had to do was plug in the access point where we wanted it I could had configured this particular access point to work off of mesh as it was going to be impossible to Rite more ethernet cables and Poe down we just didn't want to make it that complicated so the b15g is plugged in and has power we're going to plug in the access point anywhere you want within Wi-Fi range and that is going to broaden the Wi-Fi network so we specifically put it in this closet EC and right behind and like kind of below that closet on the outside is where those additional TVs and other other devices he was trying to get connected to the internet and was having some just general Wi-Fi problems he was also having Wi-Fi issues all the way in the back of his rig because it was just going through the kitchen and going through closets of metal hangers and he was just having just general distance problems uh so this will allow that basically the Wi-Fi will just get a little bit further back uh with the access point kind of preconfigured all it really was was finding a plug plugging it in mounting it where John wanted it and just kind of letting it sit there for 3 or 4 minutes until it came online found the b15g Wi-Fi and started broadcasting it was really really quite a simple upgrade for us um and the improvements were drastic so when we immediately started just doing testing for everything we did a speed test we connected through starlink through the WAN port and we were immedately seeing you know huge huge improvements on the internet speed now the access point 2 worked perfectly you can go into a lot of different areas um of the peping to check which devices are connected to which access points all that so we were doing that to make sure the right stuff was connected and we were getting decent speeds through the entire RV now the last exciting thing about this is John was going to be moving to our M series data plans uh this works now on all devices so we've had M series out for a while was pretty limited on the devices it used we've now been able to open that up to all peplink devices we sell uh if you it runs on eim if you're if you've bought a newer device in the last year or so uh that has an eim capable that's great if not no worries it also will work on a physical Sim we can send you but these M series plans are it's M series for multicarrier plans so one plan one subscription you can pay for depending how many gigs you want but it'll still jump between any all major US carriers so one plan and you can get access to T-Mobile Verizon and AT&T depending on what's available in the area what he was excited about with the M series plan and adding that to his setup is he will now have Wi-Fi no matter if starlink is set up or not uh they plan to use starlink as their primary for data as it gives them about a terabyte a month um of usage but when it's not set up or you're under a tree or you're in a place where starlink might be slow because everyone's using starlink uh you can now switch over to this cell connection it'll pick up whichever carrier is available in that area and keep you connected even if you just didn't get Starling out that day you're parked under a tree you're in motion whichever whichever uh why starlink is going to work for you that particular time the cell will just be there as a backup um and this can be something you have just automatically roll over or something you can manually configure when it's turned on and turned off uh for M series there's lots of different plan options if you want a lower gig more emergency plan like 100 gigabytes a year all the way up to 100 gigabytes a month you could do that uh we also have much bigger plans if you needed something that's more like an unlimited or 500 gig plan depending on what you're looking for we have different options in this M series lineup uh so you can check all that out on our website at mobilus have.com mseries what made me most excited about this video is at the end of the day I had a very happy customer and John was very excited about his internet speeds and how reliable things were just overall it was working better for him that is always our goal here at mobile must have so if you are having an issue or you have any questions or trying to figure out how to get a setup similar to this for your own setup please feel free to give us a call uh you can chat with us on our website shoot us email whatever your best form of communication is it works for you can start with email then we can call

{"id": "Bxmhbswsql8", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "RURDjRa1bI9GEURcIvZgQlgGUqc", "transcript": "this is a major announcement peplink has just released the new B1 5G router this is looking a lot like a good choice for mobile connectivity come along with us and I'll tell you all about [Music] it before we get started on the B1 Pro I do have a minute that I'd like to ask from you to talk to you about something that I'm worried about with the B1 pro peplink has made thec decision to sell this device on Amazon using something called Amazon FBA which means fulfilled by Amazon that means peplink sells it to Amazon and Amazon sells it to you Amazon is not a peplink dealer in the sense that they don't have support and they don't have the ability to give you any support their options are for you to either return the device or for you to contact peplink and pep Link's support is lacking they typically use dealers like us to bridge the gap what we ask that you do is if you're interested in buying this on Amazon please click on the Amazon buy link below so that you're buying it from us it still ships from the Amazon warehouse It's still Prime it's still all of the things that normally are what you'd expect from Amazon you're just buying it from our Amazon store which gives us the ability to support you and give you warranty support on the device if for any reason on Amazon you do see a listing at a lower price than our listing just reach out to us I'll make sure to get that corrected and give you a price that will save you an additional $10 to the lowest price that you see there all right so let's get to it so the B1 5G shares a very similar chassis to the balance 20x but other than the physical characteristics on the exterior there's really not a lot of similarities between these two devices it's pretty much a complete overhaul I'm going to Rapid Fire some kind of highlevel specs at you about why this is a big deal and why it matters so much then we'll dive a bit deeper into what's in the box and some of those key features and what they all mean to you first off the b15g at its kind of core is designed to be a multi-wan router or a multi- internet solution and it comes together with a lot of really awesome features right out of the box right out of the gates just kind of talking about what is probably most important for everyone and what's on their mind is that this has a x62 second generation 5G embedded cellular modem that modem is going to give you a Max download speed of around 3.5 gbits per second and about 900 megabits upload you can check the spec sheet for the exact details but that's a blazing fast second generation 5G modem that's going to support things like AT&T's Andromeda spectrum and give you that much needed carrier aggregation that you can use with multiple 5G simultaneous streams from those cell towers all that means is it comes down to giving you faster upload and download speeds with the second generation embedded modem next you've got two integrated Wan ports wired Wan ports and peplink is really realizing that in addition to embedded cellular people are using a lot of different Technologies while on the road or in a mobile office or in a mobile command center whatever to stay connected so they're giving us a lot of wired internet options if you're using this in a home office or a branch office location these wired ports could be cable modems multiple redundant cable modems or if you're in a more rural setting or if you're on the road or if you're in a marine application these could be starlinks more than one starlink uh this could also be a T-Mobile home internet connection if you're looking for just a high gigabyte very lowcost option you don't get to use antennas and a lot of stuff with those but it can be a really solid backup and you start to round yourself out into like oh my god I've got so many connections here you've got your embedded 5G you've got your two uh wired W sources here technically right out of the box included in the licensing you can turn one of these land ports into a third wired Wan connection with the virtual Wan license included in speed fusion and then on top of that you've got a USBC Port here which allows you to tether a USB modem which could include a cell phone if you're interested in doing that or you could look at a Max adapter from peplink which will work a little bit better and it gives you the ability to hook up an external antenna but that could give you two 5G connections and uh two wired or up to three wired connections so multiple starlinks or multiple external connections all in a system with an embedded 5G that can then Bond all of the these connections together for an unbelievably stable connection to the internet that brings me to my next really big kind of high Lev feature update there is a very fast processor in the b15g this little guy supports up to 400 megabits of throughput with a speed Fusion unencrypted connection that's that's pretty quick that's on the level of speeds that we were seeing out of our Pro Series uh modems like the transit Pro so I'm very excited to see that level of processing power why do you care about processing power well first off yes this is a gigabit router so you can it will support up to a gigabit of throughput uh so if you know have gig speed cable modems you want to plug into it it will it will throughput all of that and it will do it easily we've verified it's a great little router but when you start to combine multiple connections like the 5G and starlink or multiple starlinks and you're putting them all into a combined tunnel that you're going to use so that any one of those connections can get disconnected and you won't lose that important Zoom call that requires processing power and 400 megabits of total combined speed in a tunnel is a lot it's going to get you what you need you're not going to be bottlenecked by that processor even though you're getting this at a very low price point for your local connectivity the b15g includes Wi-Fi 6 so you're getting that later technology Wi-Fi that does a better job in kind of dense environments where there's a lot of Wi-Fi like campgrounds and marinas so Wi-Fi 6 is included as well as two wireless antennas that's dualband Wi-Fi so you get 2.4 GHz for long range and 5 GHz for faster speed with that new Wi-Fi 6 technology now they have also included the wireless access point controller in the b15g which means you can add with this particular model up to 30 secondary access points anywhere that you want either with wireless Uplink doing a wireless mesh or if you run an ethernet cable from one of these land ports to external wireless access points with optional licensing you can actually increase that up to 50 external access points but if I was going to run a 50 access point Network I might go with a bit of a higher-end router but that's just me but it is doable all right so I've rapid fired a bunch of kind of highle stats at you uh just so you didn't have to watch through a ton of the video to get every little thing but now we're going to slow things down and give you kind of more of an overview of the router and everything that's going on since this is a first look video talking about what's in the box for a second you're going to get your b15g mobile router and an included 12volt power adapter that uses the micro Molex connector this router will work from 12 to 30 volts DC power and yes you can combine it with our DC fused power cable which are optional to wire this directly to 12v in addition you're going to be getting two updated Wireless Wi-Fi 6 antennas and you're going to be getting your four small cellular antennas that are the new updated 600 MHz to 6 GHz 5G antennas you'll also be getting a peplink branded bit of wire management here that you can see in yellow orange and you'll also be getting a Sim injector tool one thing to note on the power cord is that they did include a European optional power cord adapter actually a global power adapter so it not only includes the USA plug but it will include plugs for just about everywhere around the world and Asia and the UK and all of Europe so you're covered there that included AC power supply is a 120 to 240 volt Auto switching power supply so you don't need any DC or AC step converters to move around globally and operate this device last of course you get that small tiny little get started guide that helps you understand where all the antennas go and how to get the modem initially powered on looking at the unit for a second on the front here just going briefly we've got our standard complement of uh status lights so we've got a status light obviously solid red when it's booting up uh solid green when it's active and running and blinking green when it's rebooting or going through a firmware update just nice to know kind of what's going on there a Wi-Fi status light here that'll let you know when the Wi-Fi is on uh that's the local Wi-Fi not the cellular and then a cellular status light here blinking when it's trying to connect solid green when it's connected we've got our two Wi-Fi 6 antenna ports here using the standard RP SMA with the pin note that that keeps you from accidentally installing the cellular antennas which are uh SMA not rpsma these ones do not have a center pin that reverses so please just make sure that you use the right antennas on the right ports there but going back to the front we've got a new updated style of SIM tray here for installing the Redundant two SIM cards that will uh be associated with the 5G embedded modem here uh it's it's a tradeoff I really wasn't a big fan of the previous Style on the balance 20 X where you needed a screwdriver to remove a plate from the lower side but in this case you're going to need a paperclip or the included Sim injector to get access to your Sims here so it's it's the newer style and this does take the Nano 4 FF size SIM cards here it's very similar to what you see on the side of phones to be honest over here we've got our USBC Wan Port this is not for powering the device this is for connecting up a tethered phone or hotspot device so that you can control a second modem from within the peplink management interface turning the device over we have our four cellular antenna ports again SMA ports here that will correspond with the embedded 5G modem and then we've got our four Lan local area network ports and then our two Wan ports here past that we have our four pin micro Molex microfit Molex connector for our DC powered in with our negative and positive DC labeled as the lower two pins and then up above we have ip1 and two for machine to machine communication like GPO communication which is something that you can do with this device if you're looking to control something externally with those two Ex two additional ports um additional information on that will be dependent on firmware support and other things but they have built that into the hardware uh right out of the The Gates Again mentioning it that the Lan ports are assignable to WAN ports you get one virtual Wan Port right out of the box with your Prime Care subscription but technically you could add additional licenses if you wanted even more Wan ports to daisy chain additional internet sources moving on to the side here we've got our kind of standard lock Port here for desktop locks if you want to pick one of those up on Amazon they're basically just computer desktop locks a turn key there and that will secure the device to whatever you attach it to and then on the bottom here we've got our standard serial number information but we've also got two mounting ports here so this can be mounted on a wall using some screws that are not included so big question that our customers at mobile mus have are going to ask is does this support Fusion Sim and can I use Fusion Sim or mobile mus haves M series data plans uh in this device and that's not to be fused with eim data plans which you can go get directly from the carrier and possibly in the future if you're watching this video we may have Asim data plans as well but as of the filming of this we do not the short answer is that the b15g supports eim it supports physical Sim through those physical Sim ports here uh and it does not support Fusion Sim technology at this time but there is a little bit of a caveat if you were to plug in a device that did support Fusion Sim like you were daisy chaining an existing Transit uh Pro device that supports it or a uh more more realistically I would say one of these Dome devices like you can see right here a dome 5G that device supports Fusion Sim and many customers especially our marine customers may be interested in using this as a cement a Central Command and center for the internet if you have something like this that supports Fusion Sim you can install this up on a mast or up on your roof and then with a single ethernet cable come down and plug into the WAN Port here you need to add a Poe injector to power this but that's quite easy and with Synergy mode you can daisy chain this device and have this one control it all on a single dashboard as if the modem was embedded if you do that with Synergy mode the fusion Sim compatibility in this modem will pass through to this and allow you to use the fusion Sim technology so it's a nice touch but Fusion Sim is not supported in the embedded 5G modem at this time so the big question I'm sure that's on most everyone's mind is do I go with a br1 pro 5G at a $9.99 price point or do I look at the b15g uh which has a lower price point do I care about the pro series and what's it going to do for me that's a tricky question for folks in the RV and the Marine Community because this device is technically not considered a mobile router this is considered a Soho or like a small office home office Mobile router that's really what they positioned it towards so from a temperature perspective you'll find that this is much more rugged and the case and the entire way that this is designed is designed to dissipate heat much more effectively than this particular case now that being said we've seen a lot of folks use the previous predecessor the balance 20x in RV applications and they've done just fine with it spec-wise I think you're good to about 100 105° which seems actually pretty low if you were going to use it in any type of like mobile application but we live in climate controlled RVs so for the most part this can run pretty well because we're in the RV and we're we're not going to be wanting it to be 100° inside the RV although be careful in some of those upper cabinets you may start to run into challenges with a device that's not designed to be in that mobile type of environment moving out of the environmentals for a second and just looking at them head-to-head the Gap starts to narrow a little bit the B1 uh 5G basically the same processor as in the the br1 pro 5G so you've got that 400 megab bits of unencrypted speed Fusion throughput that 1 gbit firewall throughput so they look pretty similar there as of the time of this launch and check this cuz it may change but they are both equipped with the x62 second generation 5D chip they both have Wi-Fi 6 and um the the B1 5G starts to shine when you look at number of ports so you've got the Dual the two Wan ports on this device you have a single Wan Port here yes the ports are aign but with the pro 5G you just have fewer ports in general so you may end up having to add a switch or something in the future so they are very similar devices today in terms of what they uh can do but keep an eye on the br1 pro if they do any type of generational adjustment to improve its um settings that might start to separate them a little bit but right now the B1 uh 5G is an exceptionally good value if you can tolerate the fact that those heat characteristics are not going to be really allowing it to be in as harsh an environment now I want people to understand that just because your RV is cold or climate controlled when you're in it remember you may be wanting this to operate when you have your RV in storage and if you're storing it somewhere hot that could be a problem for you and all of your critical system monitoring tools that allow you to keep an eye on your RV make sure your power and everything's working are not going to monitor too well if the core Communications component your router goes offline because it overheats so just think of that as a consideration when you're deciding between these two devices that are largely very similar what but with very different price points

I apologize I am here with uh Shai and charity from dash of Adventure they're an influencer that has been helping us with some stuff they've had peplink gear for 7 months but look up there you can see they have a pre-installed roof antenna on their rig they've had our parac antenna in a box for 7 months and they haven't gotten it installed so we thought you know what this is what a lot of people are going through where they don't have uh an installer and they just don't want to get up on the roof and do an install so we're actually going to give them our new base camp solution which allows you to connect that factory installed roof antenna that has cellular antennas in it up to your peplink gear come along with us I'll introduce you and we'll get [Music] started also before I go inside I like like to do speed tests just to kind of see where I'm at I only have a Verizon cell phone with me but look at this this is what I'm dealing with here download is kind of it's it's terrible but it's okay I can survive but look at the upload it's just unusable so this is part of the reason why I'm here hi guys I'm here with Shai and chair charity from dash of Adventure uh you guys are awesome on Instagram super cool and I know your channel is kind of blown up so we're growing a little bit little bit out of time but hey that's all about the journey welcome to the club so definitely check them out they're in a fifth wheel which we can tell you guys a little bit about um but you've been in the pink solutions for a bit of time now you've been pretty happy with the internet we have yeah it's been really really reliable yeah so their their pep Link's kind of placed right behind a television um it's a little scratched up it's been sliding around a little bit but it's doing the job so it's been working and we think we can make it work better um one of the things when we were talking we found that you guys actually have a pre-installed roof antenna on your rig that has cellular antennas in it and we gave you a cell antenna a while back and it's been sitting in a box for a little over six months right so fact yeah that is super common it's like when am I going to get this installed who's going to install it can I trust them drilling holes in my roof it's like a little scary so a new product that we have at mob mus have.com is called the base camp and the base camp allows you to take your pep link like you guys have just about any model we'll give all the models in the description but just about any model and hook it up to the existing roof antenna so do you have one of these antennas that's a lot of people are going to know if you look around on the inside of your RV and the roof you should see something like this it may not have this blue sticker on it they've started adding these recently cuz people didn't know what this was to kind of uh show you that it's there me it should look like that if you unscrew it there will be wires down below and we're going to get the install all going all right before we get started some tools that you'll need a pair of pliers these are wire strippers that you don't really necessarily need but just a pair of pliers that can help you attach the little wire Taps um a multimeter is very handy you could also use a test light but a multimeter is a great tool to help you find where your 12vt power is positive and negative these are available on mobus have.com um I'm going to use a razor blade but this is sort of optional just to help separate the wires and and then a screwdriver but you'll probably see me up there using a power screwdriver because it's easier I'm supposed to tell you that you should turn check take you know take the fuse out before you do all this work and then put it back in after uh which we're not doing uh but it's really up to you in my opinion the worst thing you're going to do is blow the fuse in the middle of the install and if you don't have spare fuses it could be a problem for you so I've done this a few times so I'm pretty comfortable doing it with without taking the fuse though [Music] all right so we're done with the install uh here I'll show you a quick speed test of what we're getting we're getting North the first one I did I got almost 150 now we're seeing like 115 down and uh a little over 50 up which is really good I didn't film before we started the connection but my Verizon phone won't even connect it's got basically no bars we're in the Florida Keys at uh what's sunshiney RV Resort Encore park lots of folks have been here they can attest that connectivity is difficult here um and we are seeing really really fast speeds so one thing I noticed is you guys have one T-Mobile unlimited plan that you love and it's working great Y and um the second modem in your peplink is not really being used right now right that's correct it's it's not being used at all right now so it's good until it's not good that's correct yes so another thing we're going to get you guys set up with is a m series virtual data plan so that's basically something that you can connect to Via the cloud and that will fire up on your second modem sweet so since you guys uh are pretty happy with the internet solution and I'm not I'm thinking you don't really want another bill MH yeah we'd like to save some money we're going to go with our our oneyear and annual M series plan that really you pay for it annually but it works out to like27 $28 a month so it's not terribly high but it works with all three cell carriers so you get Verizon at& and T-Mobile and it automatically will switch between W that's great and we can put that in your second modem you can just leave it kind of disabled or in priority too so you it's put there when you need it so if you travel somewhere and T-Mobile's bad for whatever reason we can fire that into first position and and that'll be a good backround yes we love that perfect well I'm sure you guys will check in um as well directly on your channel over the period of time and we we'll continue to to keep connected awesome sounds [Music] great [Music] oh", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2024-04-03T13:15:05Z",

one of those big box camping stores and they sold you a little Gateway that didn't work so well and you ended up going with a pepwave device or you've been thinking about going with one of our pep wve devices but you want to reuse that roof antenna without getting up on the roof we've got a solution for you come along with us I'll tell you all about [Music] it this is Eric with mobilus have.com and we've got a new product for you to show you this is called the base camp and the base camp is not a mobile router it's actually just a highly flexible and dynamic enclosure designed to allow you to connect peplink mobile routers like the ones we sell at mobilus have.com to existing Wine Guard roof antennas that have embedded cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity now the claim to fame with the wiard connect 360 that you see here this is a 360 plus V2s those are the ones that have the cellular connectivity or if yours has a 5G logo on it that will also have cellular connectivity but some of the older ones don't but if you've bought a rig in the recent couple years it's probably going to be pre-installed and you'll know because on the roof somewhere inside your RV you're going to see one of these that says Gateway required and that basically basically will allow you to internet enable that roof antenna now if you have very very light needs for the internet the gateways provided by the manufacturer might be up to stuff for you um we've been friends with the folks at wiard for for years now they've showed us their products we've seen them at trade shows and honestly they're really great people they focus on getting a really really solid OEM antenna to the manufacturers that does a ton of stuff at a really low price point and that's why you see this thing on just about every RV that leaves a factory it seems like inside these domes you have a TV antenna and depending on the model you have either two or four cellular antennas and we'll get into why that matters in a minute and you have one Wi-Fi antenna typically from the manufacturer's perspective it's really easy to get all that stuff all in one antenna stick it on there take up less roof space spend less money and give the customers a lot of checkboxes in terms of features so we get why they're popular is it the best antenna out there no but would it perform probably better than using a pep wve with like the little paddle antennas that are included with them yeah it actually would we've tested it and it it improves the performance especially on the cellular side significantly what else is really cool about these pre-installed antennas is underneath that little Gateway uh cap that you see there is 12 vol BT pre-wired pre-installed power so from an installation perspective that's what base camp is going to allow you to do it's going to allow you to do a really really clean pepwave install without having to get up on the roof okay so now that you understand what's pre-installed in your RV let's talk about base camp and kind of what it is at its core base camp as you can see here is it's essentially a highly Dynamic inclosure with an integrated cooling system designed to allow you to use those Factory pre-install antennas up on the roof but to pair it with one of our Advanced Mobile internet routers powered by peplink this enclosure is designed to utilize the majority of the popular routers that you see in our mobile internet bundles you don't have to buy a whole bundle necessarily if you get base camp because you already have the roof antenna and down the road if you wanted to replace that roof antenna with something a bit higher end you you can reuse the same hole in the roof and this will all be reusable so base camp is a great kind of first step if you want to try to use the factory installed antenna and kind of go from there starting kind of at the entry level you got your max br1 mini uh cat 7 uh that can fit right in there fits in perfectly gives you plenty of room to hook everything up and that's a great entrylevel choice of router you've got if you want to hop into the 5G territory the Max br1 Pro 5G that hops into there as well I've got some antennas there that kind of show you how that will Mount into the box and if you want to look at dual modem technology you can look at the transit uh Transit Pro here which also will fit right into that box and give you dual LTE capability so you can do single 4G single 5G or dual 4G all inside this small enclosure and you get everything that you need to connect this up to that roof antenna BAS Camp is designed to screw right up into the ceiling when you remove this small cap you'll pull the wires down you'll use the included TTS to connect up to that pre-installed 12volt wire usually it's in a loop some manufacturers actually install it with this connector coming right out of the roof which was provided by wiard and you can plug that right into base camp no taaps required other manufacturers have a loop of cable up in the ceiling and because of that Loop we included taptap which will allow you to tap into that wire without cutting it and then we include this pigtail right here which lets you connect right up to the taaps really easy all you need is a simple pair of pliers to get this all set up no wire strippers or anything like that base camp will then cover the hole that you have uh exposed with this cover and the wires will go right through the hole in the bottom of base camp and it will cover everything up you screw the whole unit up with the included stainless steel screws and we have installation instructions and wiring diagrams to cover everything about how it all gets set up inside we've also included wire management cable tie offs at each of the main corners and Center points inside the box so for those folks that really want to get the wiring looking really nice and clean you've got spots for that and we've included a few zip tipes as well to make sure you keep your installation nice and clean moving on to what's in the box you get the base camp enclosure that includes the ultra quiet cooling fan and a uh cover on this side with a dust filter as well it's kind of a nice touch you've got stainless steel Hardware on all these fan enclosures and you have all of the mounting hardware to mount your router into base camp and then to mount base camp up to the ceiling um all stainless steel Hardware throughout the kit next you've got these adapters these are um SMA to MCX those allow you to connect up to the leads that are coming from the bottom of this antenna I'll show you a closeup here they snap right onto those included cables and then they will screw right into your peplink mobile routers cellular ports you get two of those included in the kit we'll talk about if you have a 5G version of this in a minute but you get two of them included in the kit and there's an optional way to go into a four leads system if you have one of those 5G units on the roof next you have your two Wi-Fi adapters 90° Wi-Fi adapters these are rpsma so a little bit different reverse polarity and these connect up to the wireless ports on the back of your peplink always keep an eye on that center pin and they allow your wireless antennas to reside inside of the box I'll talk to you a little bit about why we're not using the wireless on the roof in a minute next you have a small little wrench here it's a little mmh branded wrench that is for tightening your SMA connectors your antenna connectors we've provided this wrench it's actually purposely built and it's made out of plastic on purpose to ensure that you do not overtighten your SMA connectors and possibly break any of the solder points on your device you'll see there I've got it where it's actually going past as soon as you hit the right amount of torque it'll slip off the nut to prevent you from breaking anything next we've got a small power pigtail here that allows you to connect up to those ttap connectors if you need them for your installation again wiring diagrams for everything included with the purchase all right so let's talk about the Cellular Connections for a minute and kind of give you an idea of what you have so you know what you want to pick up if you're interested in one of these kits if you pull down this little cover and you pull down the wires you'll see a power wire that's going to be a thick wire and then you should see three small kind of thinner antenna wires I'll give you a close-up here of kind of what they look like those little antenna wires you may have five of them up in there instead of three and that's going to tell you the difference between whether or not you have this model that you see here which is the 360 plus V2s or if you have the 360 plus 5G if you have more cables you have the 5G variant the reason why that's important is only if you have a 5G pep wve if you're looking to buy a 5G device or a dual modem so basically the br1 pro 5G or the transit you'll want to pick up the optional adapter kit that's on the listing to give you two additional cellular uh adapters that go from the SMA to the MCX that just ensures that you have all the kit that you wanted we wanted to keep the price point low for folks because we think the majority of people actually have the lower antenna and don't really need those connectors and those connectors are quite expensive moving on to the Wi-Fi side of things I've kind of pre-installed here those little 90° adapters that I was telling you about the ones that are included in the kit and then these are the factory installed the factory antennas that come with this device and this is how it would actually be installed for use you'd actually have the antennas right there installed and as you can see there they fit nicely inside the case um you'll always use those 90° adapters with any model that you pick even the transit we'll talk about the transit last because it has a few quirks in terms of how you install it but um most folks are going to use the the br1 pro 5G or the mini we think so we want to focus on that to start so with the Wi-Fi by using these supplied antennas that come with the pep wve you're now broadcasting Wi-Fi that's not cellular cellular is going out to the cell tower that's what's using the antennas up on your roof Wi-Fi we're keeping inside the RV and that's because that's where your devices are your devices are not outside they're inside so we want to broadcast your Wi-Fi from the inside now you do have a Wi-Fi antenna again not cellular you have one Wi-Fi antenna in this roof kit so if you wanted to use it and the only real use case for wanting to use it is if you want to pick up Campground Wi-Fi and use that as your primary internet source or if you just you use the internet a lot outside of your RV like on the patio and you're like I want to be able to broadcast from the roof as well no problem on the listing page there is an adapter that looks very similar to those cellular adapters but it's different in that it has a reversed polarity pin on the middle for the Wi-Fi connection that's why we sell it as an accessory in its own bag so folks don't mix it up I'll show you a little closeup here of the difference between the cellular and the Wi-Fi they look very similar as you can see there but this adapter it's not not too much money will allow you to connect up to the Wi-Fi on the roof if you want to take advantage of Campground Wi-Fi or improve signal outside of the RV if you do want to take advantage of that optional Wi-Fi adapter and connect up to the Wi-Fi and the roof antenna the way that would operate is You' use that adapter to connect to the Wi-Fi antenna coming down plug that into one of your Wi-Fi ports again we have wiring diagrams for everything but then the other Port would connect up to one of these antennas that would stay in the box that way you were broadcasting from the box inside the RV and from the roof outside of the RV to give you Wi-Fi in both of those locations so big question we get so but I want to get 5G and I only have this lower end antenna what do I do well you could replace that antenna and give yourself a a true 5G antenna but you're not you're not totally stuck so we've got a solution for you these devices we've worked with peplink to enable a feature inside of them called two antenna mode two antenna mode will disable two the final two ports on the device and allow the device to operate with just two antennas instead of all four being needed that works out well if you want to connect the V2s antenna to the peplink br1 5G it's going to have uh less carrier aggregation less ability to work as effectively as it could with the cell tower as if it had four antennas but we've tested it with that antenna and it works really really well and it performs and gives us great speeds we were getting well over 100 megabits in just about all the locations so you can use that br1 Pro 5G with the lower and Wine Guard antenna um and that's in the detailed instructions on how to enable to antenna mode now for my Transit customers those folks with the dual modem device those people you know who picked up that it's a great modem or router we use it because it allows you to connect to more than one carrier at the same time and we absolutely love it first if you have the 5G version of this roof antenna simply pick up those two optional adapters and you're Off to the Races select the transit version of the enclosure and you've got the right antenna with two additional connections this has four cellular antenna ports if it's the 5G version so so does your router connect them all up you're good to go if you have the 360 plus V2s variant of the roof antenna and you want to use it with the transit you'll notice on the listing page there's a Transit version of base camp and the transit version will include knockout ports like this so that you can actually use your additional antennas in uh sticking right out of the case I'll show you a picture of it um there now the reason why the antennas are sticking out is because this particular particular model uh router has six antennas in it there's just a lot going on and it's highly dense and you don't have those antennas up on the roof with the V2s we wanted to make this box very modular and work with everyone even if you had the low antenna on the roof so the way this is going to operate is you're going to have two antenna connections to your Transit one on each of your modems up to the roof and then you're going to have your other cellular antennas protruding out the side of the base camp all available to be mounted up on the ceiling and that's going to give you the ability to have both modem 1 and modem 2 and the low-end roof antenna and the benefits of getting up on the roof and having a cellular antenna out there on both of your modems base camp like most products on mobilus

{"id": "HQOLKZdW1Lw", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "okWIbeB76jQ2txbSYug6mGyA1E0", "transcript": "hey guys this is Andy from mobile must have in this video we're going over one of the coolest new accessories in the Starling space called the trio flat [Music] Mount now this is a super cool accessory that is new to the mobile must have store called the trio flat Mount now this is designed for the Gen 3 starlink antenna the one that has the kickstand this replaces where the kickstand is currently mounted in so now you can mount your antenna flat on basically the top of any surface this really can open up the way you use your starlink antenna if you have that gen 3 version as you can basically kind of permanently mount it to a surface if you want to and it's not forced to be in this current portable State what we really like about this particular Mount is its durability overall it's made out of Asa plastic so it's super strong holds over 100 PBS on the frame it's designed to to operate at high speed so if you're putting it on top of your vehicle it will work that way and has very flexible mounting options uh I've got one of them on here but there's a couple overall which we'll talk about in a minute now this video is going to go over a couple different details about this Mount overall so if you need to go back or want to go forward or look at any particular summaries I've timestamped everything in the bottom of this video so feel free to kind of jump ahead if you need to and and really the key thing about this is its flexibility with its mounting options so let's talk about that real quick the mounting options come in a couple different flavors I'm currently sporting the magnet mounts because I was using this on top of my truck and it just basically magnet it right to the top of my vehicle super easy to use very slim and low profile as you can see here as I'm holding it um and that is just one particular option you also can get basically Pock looks very similar but has a VHB tape on the bottom so if you want to to adhere this to the surface like the top of an RV where you have more of that rubber roof that could be a great option too now there's another option which is a combination of both those it's going to basically be the magnetic feet but they go onto Landing feet Landing paths as they call them that have a VHB so you'll have four of those pads for each of these magnets you can stick those to let's say the top of an RV top of a plastic like Jeep roof or something like that or a boat and then you can adhere this then to those feet so you're just dealing with those those little four circular feet on your roof there's no holes being drilled there's nothing like that but you still have the the benefits of the magnet being able to stick this down and remove it as many times as you want um but you're also not drilling any holes and it's just it's very flexible so I love that particular option if you don't have a magnetic surface already now those are great if your surface is relatively flat but if you have something that's super curved there's another option for that that has kind of like a pivoting point on this that you can use and there's also a suction cup mount as well if you want suction cups but I really do like the magnets with those Landing feet if that is something you're looking into uh the last mounting option is really the most basic which is basically just going to be bolting it through these particular holes so there are four holes which you can see the the screws in here you can just screw those directly into any particular surface you want as well so if you really are just know you're going to go right in or you already have like a custom rack on your roof and do your own custom Mount totally possible basically the mount is just going to have an opening here for a bolt and then the mounting options just have the bolt and that mounting option included but if you wanted to come up with something custom and you wanted to just do a through bolt for that that is totally impossible as well all of those options are available on the listing page as as kind of cross sale options so if you want to learn more about each of those you can go to listing page and it kind of explains all of those in detail too uh and we're getting more in more pictures uh as we can as this is such a new product for us now let's talk use cases real quick as I think this has a lot of um interesting use cases as I've been playing with this over the last week or so the most obvious is you can easily put it on top of any vehicle especially if it has a metal roof you can put starlink on there and you can have high-speed starlink internet anywhere that vehicle is of course you're going to need to have power to it somehow I know my truck has a built-in inverter when it's on but you could run this on one of those remote batteries you know that's got inverters built in or if you've got like an actual solar system like we do and you have 12vt power you can run that on that now now obviously for RVs this SK is interesting because now you can put it right on top of your RV and you can mount this just kind of similar to a high performance one um and you can just kind of mount it on there it kind of solves this moving star link or taking it on up and down on a pole you can kind of eliminate the whole pole concept altoe as this now is just really easy to flat surface and you can leave it up there if you mounted this behind like your air conditioning or something where it was reducing a lot of the direct wind that really too could be interesting to just have up there all the time the last category that makes this really interesting is Marine so if you have a boat and you're near Coastal uh you can install this in a lot of different ways I'm sure you guys can see those options already on top of your boats whether on top of canopies or just kind of it depends on your boat there's so many different options um but you can install this in a lot of different places in the Marine aspect to get the starlink working and stabilized on Deck so that you're not constantly moving that around or trying to pin it to anything um this will keep it connected there is one thing I want to point out if you are used to the Gen 3 you have this already or are are looking in the Gen 3 the Gen 3 when you first set it up will try to tell you it needs to be aligned accurately to the sky so in basically when you turn it on you you flip the kickstand out in the app it has you point the antenna in a certain direction to try and get it to perfectly line up with satellites and that is for Optimum connection according to starlink uh this obviously you can't do that with right because wherever you're mounting this with and wherever you're parking your vehicle it's kind of locked in it's also not at the kickstand um kind of angle where you're pointing it potentially in that Northern Direction typically we've been testing that too just to see if there's really any big impact and have not noticed a huge speed impact if any with it not being uh perfectly aligned per se on the starlink app you will see a warning that the starlink is not ideally aligned we saw this a lot with the Gen 2 one too for those who had modified her taken out basically the arm that allowed it to Pivot and turn uh while it wasn't optimally you know angled in a certain direction it would still work a lot of times so just because it's going to come up I did want to do a quick quick comparison between the Gen 3 and the flat Mount High Performance antenna from starlink that I have installed on my RV now the trio flat Mount is a great option for mounting it does solve a lot of the issues um I personally have experienced with the Starling antenna mount here um you can see it's in the middle of the campground space the kids have kept throwing rocks on it like it's not a great experience to just kind of have it out so putting it up and mounting it away from traffic is great but it's still not really designed for that that in motion high-speed use we haven't had any issues with it but if you're really looking for something that can withstand that um that is what the high performance dish is all about it comes with the correct hardware for it the install Kit is very different because it knows it's going to be in most motion it's going to be roof mounted and it's really designed for that application the other thing too is with a high performance you don't even need the starlink router if you're going to a peplink right out of the power it comes with what the power module it comes with Ethan that goes right into the peplink I've never even installed my starlink router with a high performance it just goes directly into the peplink with this one you kind of are in this wiring nightmare between the power adapter then into the router and then putting the router in by mode than to get it into the peplink don't get me wrong the peplink still makes it better than the starlink router but you're still having to do all these extra steps which you completely bypass with the high performance so the high performance is still going to be my go-to solution and it's better performance faster performan this better field of view there's a lot of advantage to that but if you already have the Gen 3 and you're looking to fix some of the issues you're having with it the flat Mount the trio flat Mount can be a good option for you last part of the video is I just wanted to talk about how to integrate your starlink into your peplink so you get the best of both worlds you get the you get the failover from space if you ever have cellier that knocks out but if you ever parked under a tree or don't want to move this around uh you can have cure instantly pick up when your when your space Internet isn't working either um with this gen 3 it's really pretty easy as they have two land ports built into the router itself so you can just run an ethernet cable right from the starlink router directly into to your peplink Wan port and now you basically can use that Wan Connection in your in your dashboard as you would anything else you can drag and drop it up and down based on if you want it on or not you can now use it in speed Fusion for ciliar bonding so you don't have dropouts and all that cool stuff you get with a peplink so starlink becomes basically just like another carrier just one more option to stay connected you have cell you have space internet you have Wi-Fi as Wan you know with those pep links you can pick and choose the best one for you you can Bond all those together for ultimate connectivity lots of different options uh for my particular RV how I wired this all to work I've been testing the Gen 3 so I've been keeping it very flexible in its positioning so I have the cables basically running out my Water Bay I already had an opening you know the water bays are open outside the cabinet I did have to drill a hole in the top of my Water Bay to get into my regular basement storage compartment where I had power and then I had run an Ethernet to my peplink so I have all the starlink kind of brains in my basement Bay next to my Water Bay I've then run the ethernet out of the water Bay into you know out to wherever the antenna is that's how I had it set up for the gen two and then now the Gen 3 that I've been testing uh and the pep links are always installed where they have been right behind my TV inside uh very easy access to the roof for my roof antenna installs and it was just basically running an ethernet cable to those goes through the basement so for me it was it was easy it was a little bit tricky but it wasn't too complicated it just took me kind of an afternoon to figure out how to get wires from from one room to the other if I was to do a roof install of this it wouldn't really be that much more challenging um we have iotech options if you wanted to just leave an ethernet cable up there for your starlink to use when it's plugged in into you know into that that installed position you could have an ethernet cable up there run through iotex you don't even have to modify these cables to do through a watertight cable solution I would run that down through an existing patch I already have on my roof for solar and for my other internet cables and then honestly I have powered everything right where my pings are that drops right into my P ping cabinet now if you have any additional questions or something I didn't cover come check out our shorts we have YouTube shorts we're going to be covering more topics on this particular flat Mount showing more of its installs we're also going to be doing those on Instagram so you can follow us there if you have any questions feel free to leave a comment on this video or the other videos about this we'll get back to you but if you wanted to do something more intimate why don't you give us a call we can walk you through some of the great features of these mounts um you can even chat with us if you're more into the the computer messaging you can do that too and we are

{"id": "5POUGKLo1Fg", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "R--nkjPk8OkUsSlYp6YAUvYgIiE", "transcript": "hi guys this is Andy from mobile mus have in this video we're talking about our new M series multicarrier data plans and where and who are they best for and kind of how does that fit into your connectivity [Music] options I wanted to do a quick video talking about our new M series data plans these are a multicarrier data plan one subscription get access to all three major carriers and really how does that fit in or what are the options and how does that work into your general connectivity plan as you might be moving around we did an overview video on the technology how it works uh so if you want to learn more about kind of some of the deeper sciencey techy stuff I'll link that here Eric did a great Deep dive into that on kind of our launch video on all of this but I want to talk about more about who these plans might be good for and how we see them really working into a good plan to stay connected and be connected kind of more consistently so to just quickly go over the core technology it is basically one virtual Sim plan that you're buying and it has access to all three carriers so one subscription and you have access to AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile data plans uh based on what you buy on our website is how many gigabytes you get access to so the most popular plans right now are going to be an unlimited data plan which which is really popular it's truly unlimited there's a 500 gigabyte per month plan and a 100 gigabyte plan um so 100 500 and then unlimited we also have pay as you go plans which I'll talk about in a second but for the monthly plans that's we're talking about here um so you can buy 500 gigabytes let's say for example we'll talk about the M500 if you buy that plan you pay a monthly fee $49 at launch is the price and you have access to 500 gigabytes a month and this plan will kind of rotate to whichever carrier is available in the area you're in so if you're traveling between a lot of different destinations constantly moving and not sure what network is best at a destination you're going to this could be a really good option because it will change if you don't have coverage in one or there's better coverage in another it will automatically switch to what is there from the sake of marketing standpoint it does not necessarily find the fastest one that's not really technically possible yet um as if it would have to constantly be disconnecting you from one network speed testing one disconnecting speed testing another um that would be the only way to find the fastest and that's not really this is this is really going to make sure you're connected to a network that has availability in that area so if you really aren't sure which carrier is best and you're going to different places this can be a really solid option because now with one plan you do have access to all three major networks that have coverage just about everywhere in the US that there is cell coverage in who are these plans best for for they can be a really good match for everybody um if you're a high user a high gigabyte user you're going through a lot of gigabytes of data like I am we're uploading videos a lot we're doing a lot of conference calls for things that are very data heavy uh the unlimited plan can be a really solid option there's no real cap to that plan unless you're abusing it but there's no real cap to it you can go through a terabyte of data pretty easily and it's not a big deal and you still get coverage across all carriers uh if you're a lighter user and still working an M series like a 500 might be great or if you're really just wanting a backup plan and you know that having access to all three carriers is good maybe 100 gigs for you is enough all M series plans currently are designed to be a secondary supplemental plan per se so they need to have some way to be online already for the Ping to get this virtual cloud-based SIM card it can't connect to the cloud magically with nothing so there has has to be some sort of connection to it uh so they're designed to be a secondary plan something that's adding additional coverage for you uh there is an option that's in beta right now where you can use a peplink eim built into the product um if you want to use that to reach out to your M series it's in beta I have to say it's been working well uh but we're still testing that so reach out to us and see if that might be a good plan for you you could be online with an existing data plan and the M series is a great second plan to ad you could be online with a a very basic 50 gigabyte 50 gigabyte card from a carrier that's maybe really inexpensive and you really want to add a lot more usage this could be a great way to do that use our plan use your primary and then your your 50 gig plan maybe is a way just to get online uh and that could be your backup there's lots of different ways you can configure this for those of us working on the road working as we're traveling around the M series now gives you a lot of flexibility between all your carriers and still the high gigabyte uh low cost kind of per gig that we are all been kind of hunting for now I wanted to talk about the pay as you go plans at launch and this is as of February in 24 uh we have two kind of starting pay as you go plans they're very different so I want to talk about each one one is going to be an unlimited 7day pass so what that is is you have unlimited amount of data you can use on it and the pass is good for seven days uh and that could be great for a long weekend trip maybe a week a week trip out if you're not traveling full-time you can you can buy it sequentially so if you want to do seven days and seven days maybe doing a two week trip that is possible too you're buying access to these three carrier plans this multicarrier plan um and you're just buying it for seven days with that price uh there's no subscription to it once your seven days is up your seven days is up um but if you if if that's something you're looking for we thought that'd be a great option for those that aren't always traveling full-time uh seven days at a time could be a great start the second one is even more interesting and it is a annual plan um that is 100 gigs but is good for 365 days so it's good for a year and this is a really interesting plan because it comes down to less than $30 a month and this is where this backup plan comes in so if you're ever in a place where your primary plan isn't working and but it works most of the time you found out and you really do want to back up plan where you're like well I've got to this one place they only had AT&T and I primarily travel with T-Mobile for example this plan could be really what saves a day if that's what you're looking for so again this is purchase upfront and then the plan is good for one year no monthly bills you just onetime purchase and then the data is good for a year if you use it all upfront that's fine if you want to just you don't use it till the end of the month that's fine too but you have a year to use the 100 gigs of data now one last thing about this is device compatibility not all pings are going to be compatible with these M series plans the best rule of thumb I've got for you is if you have a multi modem device uh so a dual modem device it's going to be like a Transit Duo Pro and a br2 pro so that's got two modems in it four SIM card slots those are going to be the ones that are compatible with this uh out of the gate now there's uh a couple older Transit Duos those might not be compatible so just check the listing um it lists exactly the model model numbers that are compatible any most of devices that are dual modem sold in 2023 should qualify uh just depends on which specific model you picked up at that time so if you have any questions you can go to mobile must have uh you can click at the the sell your plan page and at the bottom uh you can find the M series listings so you can just search M 100 and you can see a list of all of those devices too there are a couple exceptions like if you have a peplink dome which is basically a big dome that had a router and antenna all buil those are compatible some of the more Enterprise level ones the mxs are compatible as well again the full listing is on the site the surprising device that is compatible is the uh balance 20x that is a very inexpensive device that has optional dual secondary modems so if you're looking for a device like that that could be a good option too okay this video is already longer than I wanted it but I wanted to give a quick option overview talk through some of these M series plans what might work for you if you had questions I kind of want to dive in deeper thank you guys so much for joining me out here at my campsite and I hope to meet you guys all on the road [Music] bye", "snippet": {"publishedAt":

aggressive price point is this something you care about come along with me I'll tell you all about [Music] it so pink is kind of known for their cellular embedded multi-wan mobile routers right so they have cellular modems inside of them this product is different but it does have some tricks up its sleeve and it could be very promising for the mobile internet Enthusiast the B1 is essentially the replacement for the Soho series of entrylevel uh routers from peplink and for those of you familiar with the peplink line you may say to yourself that this looks a lot like a balance 20x and you wouldn't be wrong this is essentially built on the balance 20x chassis or plat form to a large degree the B1 at its core is a multi-wan router so it is a prime care device meaning it has the licensing for Speed Fusion built into it and it has multi-wan or multiple internet sources that can come into it out of the box you'll see right on this side we've got Wan one and Wan 2 so we have two wired ethernet ports and because of the changes to pep Link's licensing as of some of their later firmwares you actually get a virtual Wan third Wan that you can apply to one of these four Lan ports or kind of local area network ports that are typically normally reserved for plugging in your computers and other hardwired devices but with this out of the box you get Wan one Wan 2 that are licensed forever and as long as you keep your Prime Care subscription up to date another one of these ports can be unlocked giving you a total of three wired Wan sources and technically you could add more with additional licensing beyond that so for what this is launched at which is a $299 price point you're talking about a multi-wan router that technically is capable of bonding more than four wired internet internet connections that's pretty insane sticking with the WAN or Internet inbound side of what you see on this device I'll flip it around for a second and you'll see a USBC Port here and thankfully that is not just a that's not a port for like powering the device which we've seen in some other devices like the transit this is a Wan port and this allows you to tether a large number of devices by plugging them in with a USBC cable maybe you're tethering with a phone or more you know like a mobile hotspot that supports USB tethering or um you can use pep Link's Max adapter usb Max adapters that plug right into that and those are nice because they have um external antenna ports and can really kind of round out your setup a bit more effectively than a hotspot but that Wan Port um there that USB W Port means that you can add cellular to this device so you get a lot of expandability there moving on to the other side of the device and I apologize if I call it the balance in this video I'm just used to these balance uh products being in this form factor but this is the B1 on this side we've got a WiFi 6 um dual Channel Wi-Fi configuration built into this so Wi-Fi 6 is a newer Wi-Fi technology that sort of the more traditional Wi-Fi 5 which has worked great but Wi-Fi 6 tends to work a bit better in congested campgrounds this is not connecting to Cellular networks Wireless here is broadcasting locally inside your RV to your devices but that Wi-Fi 6 technology can help you a bit in congested areas we're really gladly upgraded the Wi-Fi technology in this device the B1 also packs an integrated wireless access point controller so you can take external uh access points from peplink and manage them all on the central dashboard here um external access points can also support mesh technology um so that they can hand off to different devices for additional coverage or technically they can provide you a different additional coverage in areas where you can't run an ethernet cable we like to see you run an ethernet cable from here to an access point because it'll run faster and better but if you're in a pinch and you have a dead spot and you can't run an ethernet cable this can manage an access point wirelessly so that from here this Wireless can repeat to another access point and all be centrally managed from the AP controller as we said before we've got four wired ethernet Lan ports here for your devices and those with licensing can be converted to WAN ports for additional functionality on this side here we see that peplink is continuing the trend to move to that micro Molex power connector so we've got our four pin power connector here and uh this is going to support the 12vt input and direct wire input for vehicle applications if you're interested you can pick up a direct wire cable kit that peplink makes or you can pick one up for mobile mus have ours is a bit cheaper and ours includes an integrated fuse now peplink includes the ability to use um these two IP ports on the top for additional gpio functionality so there is some additional stuff you can do with those two second wired ports but most people just use the lower two down here for power and AR cable can save you a few bucks and get you that integrated fuse if that's what you're looking for just rounding out the physical aspects of the device nice on this series chassis you do have the integrated mounting applications down here so you can screw Mount this right up to a wall um so it does work quite well for vehicle mounted applications and lastly you've got a lock over here uh which is kind of your standard desk lock if you want to uh secure the device further on the front you've got your standard uh lights you've got your status light that'll be solid red when it's booting up blinking red if you've got kind of a problem and then you've got your Wi-Fi light as well that'll tell you when your Wi-Fi antennas are enabled in your broadcasting Wi-Fi and then last you've got your paperclip reset button on the front there if you want to restore the device back to factory for those of you are wondering what this little tiny hole is above the USBC Port it's actually a screw hole that allows you to secure in the USBC cable with a proprietary cable that peplink includes with their Max adapters so you can use a standard USBC cable but if you do pick up a Max adapter it's going to include a locking screw at the top that's going to just ensure that cable doesn't come out when you're on the road so is this a mobile router well the answer technically is no when you look at this device it is not technically hardened or kind of designed for the rugged in vehicle applications and uses that you'll see with like the br1 pro or the transit series but if you're in a you know marine application or in a motor home application like this we typically are living inside of these devices and they're climate controlled so the you know temperature fluctuations inside are more than fine for a device like this to operate I've been operating the balance 20x and other devices like the B1 for quite some time in an RV and I've had no issues with lockups or freezing even though this is not technically considered a vehicle mobile router so who is this device for that's a big question uh it comes in at a lower price point and it has a lot of features but it's lacking that integrated cellular modem and if you were going to add a 5G Max adapter that's quite pricey you would probably be close to at the price of a a br1 uh Pro 5G so who's this device really for in my opinion the people that are going to benefit the most from this device are people with existing wired internet connections probably the most popular ones being T-Mobile home internet which you can use with a mobile router like this and starlink starlink with an ethernet adapter or specifically the New Gen 3 dishes that have ethernet ports finally back on the routers can be put into bypass mode which means that the included starlink router will essentially just hand off the internet to a device like the peplink B1 as of the latest firmwares with peplink you can use starlink with these devices and they will actually show up on the peplink dashboard with starlink logos and they can allow you to get access to various Starling features through that dashboard console I don't tend to use a lot of those Advanced features it is kind of nice that it'll actually show status indicators like obstructed or other things related to my starlink but the point for me is that a device like this takes my starlink which is essentially a standalone device the internet connection starlink can use is starlink so if you park under a tree if you're in motion or if you're doing whatever your your internet connection's down when starlink is down with a multi-wan router like this you can take starlink and integrate it with a USB Cellular Connection or with something like a T-Mobile home through an ethernet port or with a regular Hotspot through USB or Uplink through an ethernet port and now you can start to have a central device that's providing Wii that you would connect your devices to so in my case this thing would be called RV Wi-Fi right so all my devices would connect to RV Wi-Fi and then the router could help me pick whether I was using starlink team mobile home internet or whatever else I've got plugged into these Wan ports and I don't have to run around to all my TVs and all my devices and change the Wi-Fi from starlink back to this to this to that you don't have to deal with any of that when you get a Central Command Center like this you can manage all of those various connections at a very low price point now I know I'm going to get this question so I want to make sure I cover it could we Bond or connect two starlinks together with this device and get additional bandwidth with two starlinks now if you're willing to pay for two starlink uh connections the answer is yes you absolutely could have starlink one and starlink 2 connected inside of this mobile router um by default if you did that and you connected devices up to the Wi-Fi and you enabled both starlinks here the device would load balance the starlinks meaning some devices would go out the first starlink some devices would go out the second starlink now if you're looking to combine them together the integrated speed Fusion technology can Bond them together into one more redundant resilient connection that can give you additional bandwidth as well so should you go out and get two starlinks cuz you don't love the reliability of the starlink that's not the direction I would go starlink could potentially give you more bandwidth if you have a ton of users or you're hosting a big Music Festival this could be an interesting option for you but but if you're looking for redundancy and you want to get a more reliable internet connection I would look to balance this out with another internet connection like a Cellular Connection now I know we're known kind of as the mobile internet people but the B1 is really a device that is going to be extremely popular for small Branch offices and I'll probably be using these inside of my home offices to give me additional redundancy in my connections I could absolutely see this being used as an office where you had a reliable internet connection maybe you wanted to add some additional bandwidth with a fiber connection or a cable modem or multiple connections where you just wanted to kind of beef up that Voiceover IP system or give yourself additional redundancy using that speed Fusion technology so this is just a killer router in terms of a multi-way router for the price point that you could use in a home office or kind of branch office application additionally I think that would be very popular for Rural Home Folks uh if you're in a rural home application maybe you've got starlink and uh the starlink Wi-Fi is not cutting it for you and maybe the starlink bandwidth is not cutting it for you in this situation you could pick up a device like this you could add multiple starlinks or you could bond this with a cellular connection that you could um either you know get a a fixed kind of Wi-Fi router from a cellular carrier or a small Hotspot with the USB port to give you cellular backup um you could honestly back it up with a DSL modem or something like that if you're in a real really R roll application but you have options here and additionally you can now you know get a peplink wireless solution integrated into your rural home application so maybe you've got a larger house and you need three or four access points to cover it all you've got your starlink you're relying on that starlink internet but that single Wi-Fi 6 access point or Wii five if you've got a starlink Gen 2 just isn't cutting it and if you have to then integrate an OB Orbee or one of these other Wi-Fi Solutions you've just got a lot of different management consoles to deal with in this particular case you'd be able to integrate your multiple you know starlink or cellular Solutions and your wireless access points and view them all on a single pane of glass or dashboard to help manage them I definitely see this being pretty big for Rural home and small home office and branch office office use the B1 is eligible for membership discounts and if you don't know about our memberships I highly recommend you check them out at membership. mobus have.com you get discounts on pretty much everything at mobilus

{"id": "Pnu71erNFRA", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "wnkyUwMiaJvujUWVbpIXSmcGpF8", "transcript": "SIM cards may just be a thing of the past with our new M series data plans see that device there it's online no SIM cards installed come along with us I'll tell you how I did that and what it means for [Music] you now for a while now peplink has had devices like this which is a remote Sim injector that allows you to put SIM cards in this device and then serve them up to other devices on your local Network like a peplink mobile router like this one so this has existed but the technology we want to talk about today is different it's called Fusion Sim and what it allows us to do is take SIM cards that are off in a Data Center and remotely inject them in two peplink routers now why do you and why do most customers care about this with Fusion Sim technology we can now take the data plans that we've been known for for quite some time and we can put them in our data center and then remotely provide them to our customers which can streamline access to data plans and give you access to multiple carriers for customers looking to travel with multiple cellular carriers that is something that typically in the past meant you had to get data plans from each of the carriers now with our Fusion Sim technology you can purchase one plan from us or naming them the M plans M for mobile basically and that plan can give you access to multiple plans inside of our data center so that you can get connected to all of the major cellular carriers but only pay one amount per month so who are these data plans really kind of going to be optimal for and in my opinion a great person for the M series Fusion Sim data plans are customers that have one data plan but are just looking for a backup maybe they go to locations where they're like oh I really you know I might need um you know another carrier and I just want to have something and because we're able to create multiple M series plans including smaller ones with less than you know big data caps like we've seen in the past we can bring that price point down to get folks backup data plans to their primary plan that can get them access to all of those carriers without breaking the bank as part of the M series Fusion Sim data plan launch we're actually running a promotion which will get you not just the M series plan but any data plan at mobus have.com a free month of data with a router purchase so if you've been on the fence you're not sure if peplink device is right for you maybe this plan sort of piques your interest and you're thinking oo I can really improve my starlink by adding cellular and a multi-wan router that can help when I'm want to park under a tree that's a great way or reason why the M series plans would help if you're a starling person and you want it to work better this is a this is a great option for you but what you're getting is a month of free data at with that router purchase that gives you a chance to make sure the device is set up you talk to our experts support team and if it's not for you you got your 30-day return you know policy and you can walk out the door I'll provide some links Below in the description to show you the collection of M series data plans that we're launching with and they're pretty similar to our other plans and that they are broken down by the amount of data or gigabytes that you get in each plan one of the big things we wanted to see out of peplink is the ability for the customers to see how much data they've used and how much data is remaining right on their dashboard and we're happy to present that as as of launch as of right now you will see the amount of available data right on your dashboard as you can see there like all data plans at mobilus have.com there are no contracts with our M series Fusion Sim data plans so that's a nice plus you can cancel any time and now activation is significantly simpler because we don't need to get you a SIM card while you're on the road so typically we can can activate in a matter of hours during normal business hours for customers that need connectivity second it's important to know that not all mobile routers support Fusion Sim the fusion Sim technology is primarily designed for multimodem pink devices so this is a ubr series which is um one of the devices but there's also the transit Duo uh Pro that's very popular um the transit Duo original from years ago does not support Fusion Sim it's a new technology ol but the Dual Pro that we've been selling for over 18 months or so does support it the br2 Dual 5G will support it as well and the balance 20x and the balance series routers will support it as well some devices that won't support it uh the the br1 mini um the the MK2 the br1 5G unfortunately that's a super popular device but because it's single modem it doesn't support Fusion Sim now why is that well the device is not magic and fusion Sim's not magic you have to have a connection to the internet in order to talk to our data center and go grab that Sim connection so peplink left out uh the technology and a lot of their entry level or single modem devices because they figured well you had to have an internet connection to begin with so why would you use Fusion Sim because you can't use it unless you're connected so H we're not going to use it we're working with them in the future to have them included in more mod models mainly because a lot of folks are using starlink now for either their primary or backup internet connection so you could go out and get a SIM card and use it in a single modem device but for right now the devices that I listed are the ones that are supported if you have a dual modem device but you don't have a current data plan um you're covered and we are launching with a included eim data plan it's different than Fusion Sim eim allows the router to talk directly to the carrier with with without any data plan or internet connection to get you online and peplink has eim data plans that we're including in our Fusion Sim data plans just a very small amount of data because all you're going to use it for is for the device to turn on go talk to the fusion Sim server grab the Sim and then place it in the device uh but what that essentially means is that if you don't have a connection out to the internet we're going to give you one as part of your monthly fee so you don't have to worry about it now in the interest of full transparency it's important you know a few things because we suspect we're going to see more Fusion Sim providers as time goes on and the technology evolves and develops because it's available to really any peplink dealer now mobilus have.com has um utilized a tier 4 Data Center and multiple pieces of redundant Hardware to build out our Fusion Sim platform we spent well north of $250,000 on the infrastructure buildout and we have multiple uh redundant what are called Sim Farms um basically pieces of Hardware like this but they have redundant power supplies in them and then we have multiple SIM Farms so they're redundant to each other meaning any one of those Farms can go down and we can still serve up SIMs to our customers because of my background in it and what I understand for building redundant Technologies and data centers we did quite a bit of that in my previous company we've built this to be highly redundant and resilient we use a data center that's known as a 59 data center which means 99.999% uptime so they're very serious about making sure you're you stay connected the reason why I mentioned that is it's just important if you are looking at another provider for one of these Fusion Sim data plans that you check what's going on because technically I could put this in my basement and call it Fusion Sim and host it to customers and that would not be the same thing a lot of folks ask us why our plans are a bit more expensive than some that you see out there well first off Fusion Sim you're not really going to see out there really anywhere because we're the first ones to develop it but it's important that I mentioned to folks kind of why our plans are a bit more expensive the first reason is we include peplink support in our data plans if you're having a problem getting connected or you're having a general problem with your router we include that support as part of your data plan so that's worth like 10 or 20 bucks a month in our opinion to give you access to a us-based technical support technician who's pepling certified and can really help you get through whatever challenge you're dealing with additionally our plans come with our guarantee meaning that if the plan is ever unavailable for any reason there's a problem there's a shutdown with a carrier whatever we will guarantee that we will get you into another plan within 24 hours now you may have to pay for exped shipping if you need the Sim in 24 hours we'll get it in the Box in 24 hours for you or we'll give you your money back for the previous month of the plan that had the issue so you get a guarantee you get the integrated support and you get the knowledge and understanding that you're working with somebody that knows what they're doing with these peplink products lastly you're getting data plans that are not for tablets uh there's a lot of plans out there that I could load my sim Farm up with that we can figure out how to get working with peplink devices would only cost US1 maybe $15 a month for unlimited data that we could resell to our customers I see a lot of people doing it and they're violating the terms of service of the cellular providers and in my opinion it's kind of like shoplifting if people are doing it it means that everybody PR everybody's price is going up because the carrier networks are getting abused at a very low price and it's causing a lot of problems not to mention those plans constantly get shut down so a big differentiator why are Plans cost more is we don't sell those plans every plan that's available at mobilus have.com we've not only tested but we've verified and we've ensured it's a router plan meaning it's designed to be working in a hotspot mobile router or data device as always if you're not a member I highly recommend you check out our memberships at membership. mobilus have.com the M

{"id": "Lsp-elF1nHY", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "5czpDfjWh9mLgrvI4Vo6DT5gawI", "transcript": "hi guys this is Annie from mobile mus have and in this video we're going over the MR2 water [Music] filter thank you so much for coming back to the channel and checking out another one of our videos in this video we're going to go over the Blue Tech MR2 two-stage water filtration system this is a product I'm very excited about as it's been something been talking to Blue about for oh gosh three years now um and I'm really excited they were able to kind of mix the best of everything we have from Blue into this system so let's first talk about what the system is kind of overview some specs How It lines up with the rest of the lineup from blue with the MR3 and the ARX and how all that fits together so you can get a good idea of what might be the right filter system for you uh and I'll give you some of my personal experiences um after that too so first all let's talk about the specs of the MR2 so this is going to be your MR2 it is a stainless steel uh housing overall very lightweight very compact it is a two-stage filter it's going to go to The Taste filter first and then the patented 0.2 micron filter that is going to be in the second stage you have the Quick Connect system which is honestly one of my favorite systems overall and everything is stainless steel so you use the very quick and easy um like little really like a post if you needed to change the filters now mobile must have is also putting this in a bundle so if you wanted all the accessories like the splitter uh you want the high pressure high flow pressure regulator and all of the hoses you can get all of that in a bundle or you can just buy the filter housing and the two-stage filter itself it will come with filters pre-installed uh and then we have more you can buy if You' like extra filters too the MR2 will also come with this bag it's Al it's included it's makes traveling really easy uh you can also open the sides and never take it out of its travel bag to use at a campground I've noticed in colder temperatures like it is now here in January uh this will keep it a little bit warmer um it's not freezed it's not heated or anything but just having in the bag if you're at like that freezing point this helps it last a little longer uh before you have to pull it in to quickly review the filters in here so you are going to have two filters you're going to have the main taste filter and that's going to take um it's going to really focus on the taste and smell of the water pulling out a lot that chlorine like taste and flavor and smell um that's just going to be its main thing it's also putting a little bit of particles back into the water going to be carbon to kind of neutralize anything that's in there then you're going into your safety filter and that is your 0.2 micron filter that is designed all around safety you're taking out viruses you're taking out bacteria I'm going to put a display here of everything um that you see a lot in water so this is really what you want now if you are new here and you haven't seen stuff I'm going to link our main kind of launch video for bluek we go over a lot about the particles and what's taking out so I'll link to that here but this is really important if you're comparing this to uh one of those inline kind of blue filters you're going to see like the they're literally blue um those are about a 20 micron filter so you might be taking out sand um and they really don't do much after that this is a 0.2 Micron so it's 100 times better you're taking out a lot more now the expectation for how long these filters last it's really going to come down to how long you use them and the Water Source you're connected to if you're on a well that doesn't have a good filter you're going to go through these faster but for most um we're seeing about four to six months of full-time use if you're a seasonal RV you're going to probably once a season you will need to change these out but again it really can change based on your water source now I do want to do a quick comparison to the MR3 which is the one I currently am traveling with and you can see it is almost identical now this is one of my very first early production ones so I've been using this a lot so it's got a lot of weathering and it's just it's been used and I really loved it the really the only difference between these two is this third stage in the MR3 you're going to have a longevity filter and this is designed to make the other two filters last longer so for me as a full-timer as I'm traveling through through and using a lot of water with my five people on board having a longevity filter again it's just making these ones last a little bit longer since I'm using this so often uh I really love the MR3 and the MR3 is great this one's still very compact overall compared to other uh two or three stage filter systems but if you're not full-time or you just need something really small and compact this is where this MR2 comes in play now one thing I also wanted to show you is what I tested when we first met blue and all the testing we do here at mobile must have I tested their early early stage two filter system um this was called the R2 at the time it's a much older kind of frame design with 3D print it was great I mean I have holes in it from things dropping this thing is I got this in 2021 I think so we've put a lot of miles on this one and I absolutely loved it I really only needed two stage coming from one of those kind of standard inline filter that was 20 Micron I thought I was getting good water a two-stage filter was really all most people need the MR3 is great because you have that extra longevity but for most people a twage filter is really all you need again you're going to have that that taste filter and then the safety filter and that's really what you're going for um unless you're putting thousands and thousands of gallons and or you have a lot of people or you're full-time and really are going through that much water you might not need that third stage so going with a two-stage filter again I've tested this this is Road tested you can see how Road tested this one is um and that's why I really like having now an option for this MR2 this one get this two stage it's so small it's so compact it's so lightweight it's just really easy to move around now the MR2 has a flow rate of three gallons a minute that's what it is rated for uh now your RV probably doesn't have a fixture in it that is designed to go over three gallons a minute so while other filter systems might have a faster flowthrough rate I'm not sure that's really beneficial um you can look at your shower you can look at your sink most of them don't have a three gallon a minute flow anyways so there's no real benefit of getting 8 gallon a minute flow into your RV something at three gallons which is what your RV is rated for is really the perfect kind of happy medium there now there's a couple things we like to do around this so we I when I get somewhere I have the bundle for those whole things it's including hoses which we'll go over and the first thing I do is I will put on my splitter on the hose adapter or the SP it at the campground I typically have these connected so I don't ever have to connect them but then I'll have my high flow pressure regulator and this is what is not over pressurizing or over flowing really any of my Water Systems if I put too much water um flow through here it's basically like putting too much water too much air through a screen it's eventually going to start ripping holes through it so you really want to make sure your filters have the right flow through you want you want good flow right you don't want too slow of flow and that's what this comes into it's a high flow but it's going to regulate that pressure and that's why I have this these kind of sitting up in front of the actual system itself then we have a couple different hose options I just for a demo I have this 5 foot here uh we have a 25 foot and a 50 foot steel braided hose just like this one um you can get 225s you can get 150 I a 45 foot rig so i' just do 225s it's kind of perfect for us and then once these are all Quick Connect systems all the way through so once it is connected to the spet it's a Quick Connect into whatever you are on the SP side and then it quick connects right into the filter it's super simple and it takes you now seconds really to set up this entire system now what I like about these little kind of one meter 5 foot hoses I know it's the same I think they're 5 feet um this will actually drop from the RV so you go filter and then you have this quick connect sitting inside your RV already pluged pluged in and then it's a quick drop into the RV so it just makes connecting things really easy so the bundle system will come with everything you need to go from SP it to RV you don't need to have anything all ready for this to work the bundle comes with everything you need to get there again you can just get the housing but the bundle is so nice because it's just it's everything you need it's working everything is Quick Connect and the only time you're ever screwing basically something in is at the campground level and it's just it's really nice now one last great feature about this particular housing is it does have mounting of screw holes here on the back so if you had room inside a water Bay or any of those storage Bays you can mount it now whether you want to do that for storage or use just kind of have it always inside that is an option and that way you have a very flexible unit that could be outside when it's warm in the summer or in the winter if you want to keep it inside you can do that too now when you buy this particular unit it will come with a quick connect setup for each side so if you wanted to use an existing hose um and you don't want to get any accessories you can do that and you'll have basically the quick connects to put on those sides already that are designed for this system for my final thoughts if you're asking us here at mobile must have what might be the right filter system for you I think it really kind of comes down to your storage location and your storage space overall and how much you are using your water if you are going to a lot of different places the water is less clean you're doing a lot of usage of water again either a large family or just for whatever your lifestyle might be you might be going through a lot of water having the longevity filter is going to help these other two your tasty and your safety filter last a little bit longer it's taking out some of these bitter bigger particles before anything else is uh but it is a slight bit bigger still very small and Compact and lightweight but it is going to be that much bigger and now if you're really needing something small compact you don't have a lot of space like a truck camper or even some of those smaller bumper poles or Class B this might be a really really solid option for you now both of these do require your flow to have pressure so something that comes from a water spet house Campground City Water something like that if you are looking for a solution that you are trying to pull water from from like a pond or a stream because you're doing a lot of off-grade camping we have Solutions like that too and that is going to be called the ARX at this uh and I'll link that up above um so you can look at that that's a super cool product that ALS also does pressurize water so if you just want to pass through water to do filter like if you're at a campground you can do that too uh but this is going to be your main if you're mainly camping at campgrounds and stuff like that this is going to be what you want to go with one of these two super solid options all right guys if you have any other questions or something I didn't cover in this video please leave a comment down below we'll get back to you or it might be better for you to shoot us an email and we can personally kind of connect with you and talk to you about what might be the best option for you and your camping style you can do that at in o@ mobilus have.com if you want to talk to somebody we'll call you back we can set up a phone call consultation and review anything you need to there too and you can set that up at talk. mobilus have.com thank you guys so much and I hope to see everybody on the road bye", "snippet": {"publishedAt":

{"id": "nqjC-1-TvKA", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "_vN0Gf0D6hNaUjWyg7NApPQN9JI", "transcript": "hey guys Eric with mobilus have.com here and today I'm in the South and we lost power at our Campground due to these incredibly high winds that you can hear sorry about the audio it got me thinking about the fact that I haven't shared with you yet the portable water filtration system that I travel with and what I do when a park loses power which often means they don't have any water pressure So today we're going to grab some water for our rig out of that [Music] Lake [Music] now the vast majority of the time I'm camping and traveling with pressurized water systems meaning a hose hook up and I can turn on the spigot and water comes out it's a pressurized system and if all you want to do is use pressurized water systems the ARX may not necessarily be for you but if you want more flexibility and you want the ability to do what I'm going to do today in a pinch the extra cost of the ARX may be worth looking at if you're not looking at an ARX you just want to look at pressurized water filtration check out the MR3 bundles on our website which I'll link as well they're not blue they're just going to they're made by blue but they're not blue in color they're just stainless steel and they come at a lower price point uh for pressurized only systems though all right so let's talk a little bit about the ARX and what separates it from the MR3 now as you can see here if I give you a closeup of the ARX it has a pump in the middle here and it also has a mount here this is specific to the bundled plus version for a battery the the non bundle version still gives you the battery you can buy the battery pack um and you can power it with 12 volts but this gives you the mount for the battery and it comes in a full kit that's why we stock the bundle kit and I'll go into the full unboxing of everything you get in a minute but starting kind of just with the summary of the system itself you've got two filter housings here and you've got the pump in the middle for battery operated power now before we get into how to use the pump I want to show you here a picture of the system working without battery and without the pump enabled and as you can see there the water is Flowing freely through a pressurized system so for me I can travel with this system in my class a motor home know that I have that pump option available to me if needed but that pump can remain off the system will still pass through water meaning I can use it on a pressurized water source so it's incredibly flexible before we get into the specifics on the device I also just want to kind of talk about the size of the unit most systems that include a pump like this from competitors are north of 30 lb and this unit is around 12 to 13 lb it's Ultra portable Ultra small ultra light and still functions with the high flow high capacity 5-in filters that blue is known for that typically give us 3 to four months of use between filter transitions now if I'm going to be pumping water out of a lake that number obviously could change dramatically but I have options and that's what I love about the blue ARX system moving on to what's in the box well you get the ARX filter system that's great you get a small battery charger you get a battery housing and a battery that connects up to the system to allow the system to run portable if you want to connect it directly up to your vehicle you get a long extension cord here that will go right into your accessory cigarette lighter in the vehicle so that you can plug that right in and not worry about batteries you get your two filters pre-installed in the system and you get your 5in hose here that's designed to go into Open Water this is your in uh your inlet filter that comes with that stainless steel screens both in the fine screen and the more open screen it also includes a ball here to make sure that that the um inlet hose does not go to the bottom and suck in a lot of dirt it's all integrated into the inlet hose you get a 25 ftot Outlet hose which is great to get you up out of where your water source is and into wherever you need to go and you get the portable carrying case as well as a quick start guide to kind of round out the full kit and what I love about that small charger that you see here I'll give you a closeup on is that it has both the 12volt cigarette lighter plug on it and and the 120 volt AC power plug on it so it's highly flexible the ARX system like all Blue Water Systems has the Quick Connect system that is patented by Blue technology these quick connects are second to none you can check out all the reviews on our website people talk about just how amazing the quality is and there's plenty of stuff on Amazon that looks like this I've bought it it's not the same not even close to the same you're welcome to try to pick one up and compare them they're not even close the patented technology that blue has put together in these quick connects are awesome I've never had one yet to date fail on me and I've been testing them for over 2 years the Quick Connect system allows you to quickly get in and out on the water system without having to worry too much and they include adapter so that you can hook it up to a standard garden hose if you need an extension or something else so or you can hook it up to another hose meaning you can make a 25 into a 50 75 Etc and only pull out the amount of hose that you need when you're doing your setup it's a really cool system and it's all stainless steel which we love the ARX system and the ARX plus bundle that you see here specifically is a four stage water filtration system and you might be asking yourself if you just look kind of at this case how it can be four stage if you only see two filters here well to answer that question your first water filtration stage is actually your uh filtration system here that's actually designed to go into an open water source so there is a very fine stainless steel prefilter that's included in this hose which gives you your first stage filter now they've also included a less fine um kind of basically almost looks like a screen filter as well as an option that you can use if you're in really tough water situations where it's got quite a bit of sediment uh just be mindful that that's going to then allow more stuff down stream into your sediment filters so that may impact filter life but I love that they give you some options in this pre-filter kit next you've got your longevity filter this is essentially a sediment filter this is going to filter out big particles that are in the water that you're filtering whether it's pressurized or from an open water source and last you've got that NSF certified 0.2 Micron safety filter offgrid safety filter off- grid version of the filter here in the last position and that's only three stages so what have they done well they've actually modified this filter to also be a carbon block filter that's going to help with uh taste so this is also a taste filter this is going to help filter out um things that would commonly be filtered out with a carbon filter so chlorine taste um you know sulfur rotten egg smell stuff like that would also be included as well as the 0.2 which is going to cover you on the safety front from things like bacteria gerardia Etc 0.2 very very small 100 times smaller than what you'll typically see in a big box store and that's going to get you quite a bit more filtration so you can use water out of an open source like this talking specs on the system if you are pumping from a non-pressurized water source you've got about three gallons per minute that this system can output so it it moves quite a bit of water and the battery will pump up to 90 gallons of water on a single charge so quite a bit and if you need more water than 90 gallons I mean moving 90 gallons of water is a lot of water so I don't know if you really need to ever pump more than that but you can pick up larger M12 batteries if you want to extend that they make quite a few of them uh in those big box stores that will plug into this same adapter so that is an option as well but three gallons per minute and you also have the ability to pump up to 6 feet of vertical uh lift so if my water source is down there and I want to end up at the truck bed that 6 feet is going to also allow me to maintain that 3 or so gallons per minute pressure and still pump the water uphill now for me when I'm traveling I typically don't want to move my RV to go find a water source I move my pickup truck and I have a little 50-gallon bladder here this is not something we sell but you can pick them up on Amazon I'll put a link in a description of a company that I like this one I have they actually don't make anymore I can't find it but this has been a great water system for me and it just so happens to fit and sit in the back of an SUV be um or pickup truck and kind of lay out flat very very well so it's very easy for me to pick up water when I need to without breaking Camp I won't bore you guys by letting you wait and watch me pump up my bladder system today but at 3 gallons a minute I'm probably going to be here for about 12 to 15 minutes or so pumping that up to get my full 50 gallons of water that I'll then go back to my RV and unload people ask me how I unload the water once it's there do I pick up this giant 400 lb bladder of water no I don't I use a simple water hose and in my RV I have a water inlet that's at the kind of middle or top of my water freshwater tank and I use a hose connect it to the bladder and get the water flowing by simply using gravity and a siphoning system without the need for a pump now if your freshwater system doesn't have a water inlet in it you can usually look at the manual in your water in your RV and look for something that's called a Tre fill it's kind of a a term that was used in the RV industry a while ago basically what it will do is it will allow you to use the water pump in your RV to pull in uh water it's also the way most RVs winterize themselves that have a water pump so because if you think about it you put the hose to winterize into the antifreeze but instead of putting it into the antifreeze and sucking the antifreeze into your RV you're going to be putting it into the bladder and pulling fresh water into your RV so it's very possible to move from a bladder system back into your RV quite easily what else is great is everything is labeled on the system for in andout you see your flow directions right on the pump but you really don't even need that because of the Quick Connect system all male and female ends only fit in One Direction so you kind of always know that your inlet hose goes on the end it goes on because it's the only one that it fits on that's pretty much it there's my water flow and I'm honestly not in a particularly good spot out there um I'm going to reposition the hose before I get everything going for my 50 gallons of water and as you can see there it's as simple as that I don't have my outlet hose with me but the inlet's doing its job and I'm getting a nice steady flow with quite honestly a pretty terrible throw I'm probably going to throw that back out and get myself a bit more into Open Water but the system does an absolutely great job of getting me water in a pinch and making sure that water is safe to drink with that z.2 Micron filtration technology now as always you know no filter's going to protect you from everything if you're going to drink this water um you know you can you've seen Andy on our Channel Do It um I typically would boil the water first just as an added level of safety but it's really up to you 0.2 micron's going to filter out most of the common things you'll see in the US that are going to hurt your water thank you guys so much for watching my overview of the ARX plus bundle that I absolutely love during my travels the fact that I can use it when I'm in a pressurized water source and I can also use it when I need it in an off-grid application just makes it the perfect system for me while being super super small and portable at the 13 lbs it's pretty windy out here guys I'm going to wrap it up as always you can reach out to us at info@ mobilus have.com you can start up a chat on mobilus have.com or you can give us a call on our phone number in the top leftand Corner don't ever say I don't get out here and weather Rave the weather to tell you guys about new and cool

{"id": "hsNhI4zskz0", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "xL7XLMgJ1Tr3jKGrqmBBCHmrRpo", "transcript": "breaking news peplink has just released their new x62 5G version of the br1 mini entrylevel mobile router it's coming in at a very aggressive price point making it the lowest price point we've ever seen for latest generation 5G from a reputable manufacturer come along with us and I'll tell you all about [Music] it now I hate talking about pricing in these videos because pricing always changes but at the time of release of this video and of this device peplink is providing this whole kit that you see here for $499 inside of the US market and that's a crazy good price considering that if you were going to buy just the 5G module inside of this just the little modem it would probably be $200 to $300 or so on the retail market so to get the entire package with the mobile router with peplink with their software with their hardened cases with their accessories and antennas Etc is a really aggressive price point and we're excited to tell you about it now there are some limitations on this device it was actually designed for iot and kind of business applications but it does have a place inside of the mobile community and we'll get into that in a little bit Inside the Box you get the peplink mobile router with that x62 modem inside of it now you can always tell by the model number that you're getting in x62 by looking for the 5gn designation inside of the part number as this one has you get the AC to DC power adapter with the mini Molex connector this is good for 120 or 240 volt applications if you are a globe trout you get the four cellular antennas and these are the new 600 mahz to 6 gahz cellular antennas that peplink has released and you get the quick start guide included and a little roll of branded Cable Management tape as well the x62 modem inside this guy pops quite a punch at 3.5 gigabits of Max download speed and 1.5 or so gigabits of Max upload speed that's a ton of speed now the router inside of it the traffic cop that keeps the outside out and the inside in or your firewall as it were is going to provide a Max throughput of 300 megabits per second now if you're looking at the br1 Pro 5G that has a 1,000 or 1 gabit maximum throughput so this has a slower processor in it but 300 gbits is still pretty darn fast and faster than the speeds that most folks are seeing in 4G networks today and a lot of the 5G networks are kind of around that speed anyway I don't think anyone's going to be too unhappy if they're getting 300 megabits of download speed on a 5G connection with that said I'm not sure I would put this at the Hub of my remote connectivity setup as a road warrior or somebody who's really pushing the internet when I'm out on the road but we'll get into that a little bit it is a great entry-level device for folks that want to gain access to the latest 5G bands and you know be able to connect to the latest towers and the latest technology with that second generation 5G but they don't want to break the bank before I get into how I would add this into my setup and kind of where I think it fits for the majority of the mobile Community I want to talk to you about the device itself and some additional things to consider first it's important to note that this device does not have Wi-Fi in it so if you were going to try to use this as the Hub of your mobile connectivity setup you would need to connect your devices to the ethernet port with an ethernet cable now it's not to say you can't add Wi-Fi you could easily add Wi-Fi using a peplink access point or another branded access point if you have one um I personally would recommend adding uh if you're kind of going at the entry level price point you want to keep cost down and you just want to use the Wi-Fi and you're comfortable with you know 100 megabit 150 megabit Wi-Fi speeds which is pretty darn fast I would go with the ax uh mini access point it's got a very aggressive price point and it would put your access point in this device at like 60% of what it would be to hop into a br1 pro 5G and you'd have a pretty nice comprehensive setup but there'd be a little bit more involved in getting it all working because you'd have two separate components so it's just something to keep in if you wanted a more aggressive access point with the new Wi-Fi 6 technology look at the ax light it's a few bucks more but you get faster throughput and it does a little bit better in higher congestion areas we have videos on those products separately but I will link them in the video just so you know how you could add Wi-Fi to this device now getting into how I would personally use the device now we've been telling folks and we're still telling folks that the best router for us in our opinion to pick up right now is the max trans it pro which is a router that's $9.99 and we have some specials going on probably still going on now but keep an eye on the promotions page on our website now we've told folks that if you're looking for Reliable connectivity you're better off getting a dual 4G than a single 5G if you have a budget constraint and you want to keep that under that $9.99 price point now one of the best advantages of the transit looks kind of like this this is a Transit is that it has a very fast process processor in it and it can do a lot to control multiple devices so if you picked up a Transit device and you're thinking about man I really wish I could add 5G now in my opinion is the time because this little guy has a very aggressive price point and you can connect these together with a simple ethernet cable now that ethernet cable connects and then you can control this 5G with your existing Transit using something called Synergy mode and once you enable Synergy mode this device will effectively just pop up on the dashboard of this device allowing you to control the embedded 4G modems in here as well as your new 5G giving you a total of three modems for a killer setup you could have AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile all running at the same time as well as now have access to additional ethernet ports here if you wanted to add something like starlink or something else via those ethernet ports or landan ports that you can assign to WAN ports there's so much flexibility so for me and this kind of a sneak peek at a future video that you're going to see for our ATC Game Changer toy hauler this is actually my setup that I'm installing because I can get three cellular modems with this dual 4G and the single 5G for $1,500 retail MSRP as of today and that's significantly lower cost than the br2 which is dual 5G yes there's some trade-offs there's no USB ports here to add USB modems but for just a turnkey one and done I want to have access to all carriers and the ability to add starlink that's a killer setup for a killer price point it also means for customers that already bought a Transit that you now have an upgrade Pathway to get into a 5G device and still be able to use those speed Fusion technologies that let you combine all of those connections in into a single unified sdwan tunnel so that if any one of your connections goes down you still stay connected to those important phone calls Zoom meetings whatever so that in my opinion is where the mini 5G fits best it's a great entrylevel device that you can add Wi-Fi to and keep the price point significantly down below the br1 pro 5G but again you've got a little additional setup or for more advanced users this now is my go-to option for adding the latest generation 5G to my existing peplink setups using that Synergy mode technology this device is eligible for membership benefits so you will get a discount if you are a member and if you

{"id": "i0ZwLnTnhrA", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "BnPwINZkuYKVUuQYj_z6rxui0OY", "transcript": "sliding into 2024 peplink has released some new antennas Dash mountable slim antennas for interior mounting and easy use couple different options here come along with me and I'll tell you all about [Music] them hi I'm Eric with mobilus have.com and thanks for joining us so for folks that are familiar with the peplink mobile routers uh whether you're looking at like the transit series popular on our road Warriors the uh b15g which is our Speed Demon bundles or the little mini classic which we offer in our full-timer bundles you know that they come with these paddle antennas and these this is the cellular side we're talking about mostly cellular today but um these antennas uh will give you approximately two to three DB of gain or kind of like uh almost like boost I don't like to use the word boost but these will improve your signal and that Improvement is typically measured in gain now between two and three DB of gain is actually 100% of improvement of cellular signal so folks who have worked with these have kind of realized that this gives you quite a bit over this which doesn't really it has an antenna but it's very small and it's integrated into the phone which is what makes these mobile routers really popular even when you just use the included antennas now if you want to knock it out of the park I'm going to skip ahead and tell you to just check out our roof antennas those are going to be the best possible performance and those are going to be included in our bundles but for those who aren't comfortable necessarily drilling holes in their roof and adding an antenna or for those who want Ultra portability or just something that's going to give them a little bit of an upgrade from this I've got something to show you this right here is Pink's new slim line of interior Mount antennas now now this antenna is actually multiple antennas all in one and it comes in a different a couple different variants or flavors and It's tricky because they are literally identical in size and appearance but they have some very key differences before we get into the model designations and which ones probably for you depending on your mobile router application why would you want one of these well uh this is going to give you a uh a cellular kind of gain Improvement of I mean on the 40G they're claiming like 8 plus DB uh but they're in frequency ranges that are not commonly used in the US so I would say a safe number is going to be in the sixes so a six debel gain Improvement uh compared to the stubby antennas we talked about at the beginning being kind of more into the two to three range so this could be effectively like 100% Improvement in your cellular connectivity by simply sticking this effectively like to a window and just plugging in some cables so that's a very easy upgrade for folks that don't want to do a big roof installation moving on to kind of how you would Mount this well I believe it's really effective most effective if you mount it in a window um and if you look there's a little thing that says GPS mount up and out and effectively what you want to do is have the peplink logo facing out towards the outside and they've included this 3M dual lock um basically like velcro but it's it's better than velcro it's much more removed removable and it lasts much longer and it's really designed for being out in the UV um this is the same stuff used by the New York Port Authority for easy passes and it it lasts a very long time and it's very very strong to hold up an Easy Pass they give you a piece about a half an inch long and it it stays on there you got to use a razor blade to pull it off so I would actually say that this is about twice as much as you need um I would cut it in half and do a small strip here and a small strip there there and while not necessary it might be worth just picking up a little alcohol swab to prep the surface before you add this then the other side would obviously go on the window where you want the antenna mounted and you could click it on there and just sort of forget about it and leave it there or you could remove it during travel day if you're in a van or something where you're putting it up front in the driver cab area now just to note at least in the US you don't want to mount something like this in the driver cab area on your windshield or on your side windows while you're in travel mode uh that will most likely be a a DOT violation and that will uh get you a ticket so um it's nice that it's removable um for folks that have limited window space with some of our other model stick on kind of antennas we actually have seen some decent improvements by actually mounting this on a wall in the RV use a stud finder find the studs and you can mount this in between the studs uh facing out and this can actually give you some decent Improvement if you don't want to take up valuable window space uh I've seen folks Mount these like behind a television uh where their router is that was what I did back in what way back in my 2015 install uh and it worked pretty well so uh that is an option for you if you want to use this without taking up any window space so let's move on to model designations uh because they look basically identical but they are very different the 22g and the 40G have very different antenna elements inside of them the 22 2 G has two cellular antennas and two Wi-Fi antennas and one GPS antenna we'll get into what that kind of means in a minute but I want to stick with the high level for a second the 40G has four cellular antennas and one GPS antenna so no Wi-Fi in the 40G so which one's going to be right for you and why did they kind of make them up like this well it's kind of a blend right so the 22g is going to be best for folks that have an LTE uh cellular router that is a category 12 or below um cellular modem that's going to be a a uh LTE device that'll have two cellular antenna ports like this mini we have here cellular 1 cellular 2 right here on the top um and it's also going to give you the ability to have Wi-Fi uh in this antenna now why would you want Wi-Fi on your dash Mount well it would most likely be because you were trying to pick up Campground Wi-Fi using the Wi-Fi as Wan technology so if by mounting this on the window you'd have a better chance of picking up the campground Wi-Fi but for the vast majority of our customers they're most likely going to be looking at the 40G uh portable slim antenna and that's because it has those four cellular elements now four cellular is going to be compatible with our newer category 18 category 20 LTE devices and our 5G devices which all have four cellular antenna ports on those devices now you're going to lose out on Wi-Fi but for the most part the customers that are investing in the 5G or the higher-end cellular technology really aren't relying on Campground Wi-Fi that much anyway and that's why peplink made the decision to keep the body of this small um and delete the Wi-Fi from the 40G if you're one of our customers that has a dual modem device like this Transit here this is a dual category well it's a category 7 and a category 12 combo this is in our road warrior package the 40G will work for you you're going to use two of your cellular elements on modem one and two of your cellular elements on modem 2 and this can be a nice easy simple upgrade for this device to get you up and running if you're one of our customers that has a dual 5G device like our br2 and our ultimate Road Warrior device you're not left out you can absolutely use use these Dash antennas but because you have two 5G modems you need eight cellular antennas so you're going to have to pick up two of these and if you're going to stick two of these to the wall you're going to want them to be a minimum of like 8 in apart from each other so just keep that in mind so that they don't fight with each other for Optimal Performance if you have to mount them closer together it'll still work it's not going to cause problems it just may not be as effective and it may not pick up the cell signals as well for detailed specifications on the 22g and the 40G you can hop over to the listing page you can also just search slim on our website they'll both come up there and click the documentation Tab and that will give you the detailed documentation PDFs that include all of the graphs and performance information on these antennas I'm actually packing up these antennas and sending them over to Andy our antenna Guru at the mobile internet Resource Center he's going to be doing a deeper dive analysis on these to see exactly how they perform

{"id": "Z_ZghYdQn1o", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "_fB4yjyxmnYYEoZBc2wyR04F408", "transcript": "a lot of folks don't know that I've actually been working for the last 3 years on building a campground up here in New England and today we just received final electrical inspection approval it got me thinking about a common problem that all our viers face which is that air conditioners and other high demand electrical appliances sometimes don't work the way they're supposed to while we're on the road if that's ever happened to you or you want to prevent it from happening to you come along with me I'll teach you some stuff about RV electronics and power and show you some products that can help you with that [Music] problem now to help demonstrate what typically is causing those problems inside of an RV I'm going to do something incredibly stupid right now I'm going to attach 200 ft of extension cable to this travel trailer that has a 50 amp service on it taking things one step further I'm going to do something even more stupid which is I'm going to build these extension cables with eight gauge electrical wire instead of the six gauge electrical wire that would commonly be required for a 50 amp service now before we get started with explaining all this these extension cords are getting disassembled as soon as this video is over the only reason why I've put them together is to demonstrate what I've actually found common in some older RV parks or even newer RV parks that just haven't designed the park the way they should what we also see is that RV parks that have expanded over time oftentimes are using cable to get to further sites that may exceed the amount of distance that you should use that particular type of cable for at that rated voltage the result is a condition at a lot of ourv parks especially if those parks are under load meaning a lot of campers are using electricity where the power that's coming out at the pedestal is often times much lower than 120 volt when the power is below 120 volts a lot of electrical appliances especially compressors like in refrigerators compressors in air conditioners start to struggle because they're not getting the voltage that they were designed to have when they were built at the manufacturer the end result of this often times is that they run inefficiently they don't blow cold air they have a lot of problems or in some cases if the voltage is low enough the fan will just blow and the compressor will never start at all that can be common where you kind of turn on the AC and it just never gets cold and you're not sure why then you go to another RV park or site and it just works that's most likely because you had a low voltage situation at that park now your air conditioning not starting sounds pretty bad but that's actually the best possible scenario in this situation the worst possible scenario is that the voltage drops to a point and for whatever reason the circuit breakers are not tripping like they're supposed to we we're talking about5 to $10 circuit breakers that people are flipping on and off all the time not really the best thing to do with a circuit breaker but regardless if that breaker fails that wire because that voltage is low is heating up it's heating up in the ground it's heating up in your RV and it's creating somewhat of an unsafe situation you don't want to run any 120 volt services or appliances below that rated voltage and if you get below 110 volts it starts to get a little bit dangerous that's also known as a Brown out and it can start to create uh a situation where you could create a lot of premature wear on your RV systems or again worst case scenario a fire so what causes these situations and how do you avoid them well the best way to avoid them is to build the campgr properly and to not run wires that are too small too far it's really that simple but for us average rvers we can't really do that or control that we just plug into the pedestal and hope for the best but there is a way to protect your yourself with something that I'm going to show you right now this is Hughes autof forers voltage booster and surge protector Solution that's made and designed for RVs available in both 30 amp and 50 amp models depending on your setup we're not going to get into all of the specifics about electricity but starting with some Basics you kind of have two things that make up the total amount of power or wattage that you have available at the campground one is your voltage and the other is your amperage if you multiply your amperage times your voltage you'll get your total amount of wattage that we won't go too crazy into it but that's just something important to know the reason why it's important to know is because a voltage converter or a voltage booster has the ability to reduce the amount of amps and increase the amount of volts to create a safer situation inside of your RV now you may be asking yourself how do I reduce the amps I need 50 amps that's what I need well 50 amps of power in an RV is equal to 12,000 watts and if I turned on everything in my 45t RV like everything stove tops three air conditioners the whole nine I might get to 8 or 9,000 watts and that's honestly never really happened so the idea of having to need 12,000 watts of power in an RV is virtually impossible now that being said having low voltage can be very detrimental because of the reasons that I told you earlier so with the technology and the use of something called windings you can actually reduce that amperage a little bit and get that voltage back up to where it needs to be another common misconception is that these devices are somehow stealing power from other rvers and that because you have a voltage booster the person next to you is tripping their breaker and having a problem it's actually quite the opposite it by putting a system in place like this which is kind of like essentially a big Transformer you're stabilizing the power and reducing the amount of strain and heat that's on the wires coming out from the campground so you're not only protecting yourself and your equipment and giving yourself that search protection but you're putting less of a direct load on the campground as well by putting that box in between the pedestal and your RV the biggest benefit that I've found in traveling with the voltage booster from Hughes is that my air conditioners work so much more efficiently I didn't actually know I had a problem until I started using this and just found that they were blowing colder and all of my 120 volt appliances were just happier in general when I was using this the Hughes autof former voltage booster also has the ability to boost one or both legs of that incoming service so if you have an unbalance situation the voltage booster can help balance that out just creating a safer and more reli iable power situation inside the RV by adding that ridiculous 200 ft extension cord with the wire that's under spect for my service I have created a low voltage situation and what I love about the Hugh autof former voltage booster is that I can quickly tell I have this situation by simply looking at the lights right on the front of the device as you can see here I have a low voltage situation on leg one and the device is solving that by boosting leg one to make sure that I have 120 volts of power on both leg one and leg two meaning all of my outlets and all of my appliances have the power they need to run properly the voltage booster has the ability to boost the voltage up to 10% which is honestly pretty much every bad situation I've ever encountered is solved by a 10% boost but for a full list of specifications you can hop over to the product listing pages and click on the documentation tab the system couldn't be easier to use it's it's an inline system so you plug one end of the voltage booster into the 50 amp pedestal and then you plug your RV into the side of the voltage booster and that's it so what are the downsides of a voltage booster honestly there aren't any the only one that I can think of because I like to kind of cover everything for folks is it's kind of heavy I'll put the specs right there if you're in an ultr light situation it's you know it's a little heavy and that's about it I guess the only other thing would be maybe it's not necessarily waterproof they do make a rain cover bag for it which we have as an accessory and it could potentially walk away from you since it's an expensive product so they've included a lock and a chain with it as well so that's kind of a nice touch you don't have to buy the lock they give that to you for free but yes if you've ever been in a situation where you've had a low voltage situation or your air conditioners aren't working or you've had a brown out that's blown out appliances or other things this is the single best thing that you can do to protect yourself a search protector is great but it's not going to actively change anything that's going on with the power like the voltage booster and search protector can do this product and all products at mobilus have.com are eligible for our member

{"id": "t6jRr1KhqW8", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "pkKHNtjPWt6oZlOodC6rbe4fBhA", "transcript": "hey guys this is Andy from mobile must have in this video we're going to do an unboxing and kind of beginning looks at the pepwave mobility 82g antenna this is kind of a monster brand new antenna focused around 5G so let's kind of get into the unboxing and see what we [Music] find now this antenna has been a while in the works we've been talking to peping for months about this and it was designed very specifically to work with the be V2 Pro that is a dual 5G modem and um basically requires 11 antennas to really get up and running right out of the box this is going to be this antenna it is the mobility 82g so 8 cell two Wi-Fi GPS that's kind of how the naming convention looks so let me bring it closer so you can take a [Music] look okay now that we have everything unboxed let's take a quick look around kind of of what we've got with us so it comes with obviously you're going to have your big Mobility 82g antenna and then it comes with basically two cable nexts um for lack of a better term which we talk about in a second with installation and then it's going to come with a big sticky pad uhm pad for the bottom uh so just go over kind of the specs of this thing overall so I have a tap measurer if I look at the width of this thing overall you're at about 17 I if you can see that um but you're going to be at about 17 in across uh so it's a pretty big antenna but one of the big benefits is is you are 3 in off your roof so your total height would be well depending on your install type would be about 3 in so very Sleek overall if you put that on top of an RV roof no one's going to see it it's not even going to know it's there um very low profile you just got to have a spot for 17 in so that can be pretty wide now you're going to have 11 cables drop from the bottom um and there's two different installation types the first is going to be with one of these necks so the cables will drop straight off the bottom designed to go right through your roof um and then into a cabinet or something which we can talk about more in a second but that would be one installation type just basically flush mount straight down we have lots of videos showing exactly how that install can be done which I'll link up above now your other option is going to be a flush mount option I'll put a picture up here on the screen to explain it but you're basically going to have your cables go straight out the bottom and now you can flush mount it and have the cables drop in somewhere else this is great if you have another another cable drop like for a solar or something already pre-installed you already have a hole you don't want to put another hole in your roof you just kind of need this sitting flat and you want to drop those cables elsewhere uh so it really makes your options for installation much more flexible that particular mount can have two different options you can just adhere it to your surface if you wanted to use like a dor um or something just to put it right on top of your roof depending on your roof type uh or they have a magnet Mount option so if you have a metal roof or you'd want to put like a galvanized plate up there you can do that too and have it just basically stick right on your plate peping has done a great job giving us lots of different installation types based on what type of vehicle or RV we've got so I've been very excited to see that now for this particular unit I looking at a 6t cable length and that is the one that mob M have we at mob M have would definitely prefer 6 feet is a perfect kind of match of enough space to run cables and do what you need to sneaking between cabinets and making your cable length look good inside but also not giving you a lot of cable loss um overall the longer your cables are going to be the more cable loss and uh you're just going to have so keeping your cables as short as you can feasibly um is always important so the six foot variant is very very good um and one we would recommend if you kind of are on the fence about that uh overall this antenna is going to be very high performance um you're going to get very much extended range if you compare it to a peplink with its paddle antennas upright um I have to say like here at this particular Campground I'm in a Thousand Trails my phone on T-Mobile has no service um but T-Mobile through my peplink and through this I'm seeing four or five bars very very consistent overall kind of with performance that we're seeing uh so if you're looking for a way to extend the range and just get better signal in more places putting a roof antenna like this up is definitely the way to go now this one specifically is an 11 one as we've said so this is designed for kind of a dual 5G really future proofing your RV or whatever vehicle you're putting on in particular uh there are other options if you have a single 5G unit like a br1 pro um or a Transit that really is only like needing four Cellular Connections they have antennas that's going to be the the 42g from peplink and it's much smaller because you don't need to have all the surface area for that so depending on what you've got if you've got questions reach out now if you're looking for more information about this antenna how it's performing what we're seeing out in the field with it we are sending this exact antenna um over to our friends and partners over at the mobile internet Resource Center where they're going to be doing a tear down and deep testing and

what I was gonna do welcome welcome to the mobile mus have live stream my name is Dave I'm the head of special projects with us we have our founder and fearless leader um today's topic is winterizing your RV and what I thought was really really cute was I asked Andy if he could sit in on this and he looked at me and he goes well I would except the fact that I've never had to winterize my RV I just go somewhere warm I thought that was really really funny so here we are and and us as as you know Northeastern and colder cold weather rvers you know this is something you got to deal with right well I mean it's not all that uncommon believe it or not I mean I didn't winterize my RV for the first four years of having it so I can understand it it's obviously much more common if you live in RV y um but uh but yeah this year I'm I've kind of got the interesting Trifecta of owning a travel trailer that's a three- season travel trailer which means it's really not designed to be in the winter and I have it in the winter uh up in New Hampshire right now and then I have my uh RV that is winterized which normally is never winterized because we like Andy would take it South but uh we are staying up here with the family and I didn't feel like paying for diesel to heat the uh big bus for two months while we're here so we went for the winterization got it so so is it really you're winterizing in RV to sort just like the way you'd winterize a boat which is my language to put it away for the winter really right or or you using it are you winterizing it to make it survive the winter I'm still not clear on that because you know both so um you would winterize typically or you could even call it like put it into storage uh okay for a couple reasons right so if you have your RV in storage for an extended period of time and you leave just say common tap water in your water lines uh and you do not flush that water out before storing the RV within 3 to five weeks it's kind of a guess but personal experience tells me it's pretty close you will develop bacteria in those water lines and then you will start to smell and potentially get sick from things that are growing and living inside of your water tank and your water lines um and then obviously when water freezes it expands and when it expands things break so you if you're not going to have your are you win you know heated you definitely want to winterize it and and then same goes for just soaring it in general than whether you're cold weather or not that's of a separate thing yeah having your your lines uh you know your water lines in a in a place where they're not going to be um letting stuff fester and sit would always be a good thing yeah yep yep it's a lot easier to prevent bacteria grow grow than to get rid of bacteria growth yeah that makes sense you think about it's a lot easier to saave off an infection if you cut yourself than than to deal with it once you have one yeah and a lot of people have trusty trust you know for years people have flushed out their water lines with bleach okay and haven't actually realized that almost every single water system meaning water filtration system will say never flush bleach through me and most hot water systems including Aqua Hots that's a very common hot water heater yeah uh will say never flush bleach through that either so there's there's costic aspects to why bleach kills bacteria and it's also something that the manufacturers don't want to see inside of the water lines so oh I'll just run bleach through the lines and kill all the bacteria is not not always the best thing to do since the manufacturer could technically say that you would avoided your warranty by doing that y there are ways to do to do sanitation you'd use a non-bleach Water Sanitation right chemical that's out there to do that plenty of Marine and RV searches on Amazon will find all sorts of ones that are allowed yep but the alternative is what we recommend which is the viair stuff right I mean well so uh yeah if you don't want if you do want to winter eyes and you want to kind of get yourself ahead of the game uh and not you know deal with having to keep your heat on throughout the whole winter if you're not using the RV then uh you can winterize in two basic methods one is to use well three I'll say three uh one is to use air so blow out your entire system with air uh using a compressor we sell VI our compressors it's nice to have a small portable compressor that has the power of a big commercial not commercial but uh tractor I'll say compressor one that you'd get at Home Depot something that can keep continuously producing air uh which is very rare in a portable compressor that's definitely a VR thing you mean you can't do it with a little bike bike pump for some reason maybe like just little bubbles not enough to get the water out of your lines and then uh uh RV antifreeze which you can pick up just about anywhere you can buy it on Amazon although it's very expensive you can buy it at Home Depot probably the cheapest place out there I found or Tractor Supply those are my two go-tos for like 298 a gallon for RV antifreeze um or you can do a combination of both which is what I do um I we can get into why I would do a combination of both but uh there's those are kind of your three options yeah I was gonna say you could predict my next question there would be sort of why but you know yeah so I will I will try to not use RV antifreeze in as many places as possible because it tastes horrible and when you get it in your water lines and you try to get it out of your water lines there's a lot of mixed content on this oh you know I just run my my shower for an hour and it's all gone and I'm fine I was so when you try to get rid of rvn freeze so first of all when you buy it it's pink it comes in a jug which I have over there so I can grab one and show you um it uh is non-toxic so you could technically drink it so don't get scared I mean I wouldn't drink it but you could technically but it has a it has a taste to it that's unpleasant and chemically um and it creates bubbles in the water so you sort of know you still have a res a little bit of antifreeze in your lines because when you turn on the sink your whole bottom of your sink will just look like a cloud of bubbles that immediately dissipates you're like it's still there I flushed my lines for hours and it all is gone and then I come back a day later I turn them on and I'm like ah it's just like it's back maybe that's just my RV has like a lot of lines or something but um after going through that I definitely try to not use it in as many places as possible okay now with that said if you talk to the manufacturers of the uh kind of the larger or more high-end water heaters like Aqua Hots or hydr hot systems they will tell you that it is not allowed to Simply winterize those water heaters with air Alone um so that's why I don't just use air on our travel trailer I just use air I don't even bother winterizing uh with the exception of your drain lines so you can blow out all of your water lines and forget that underneath each of your drain lines there's a little P trap that's what it's called because it's shaped like a PE y so none of your water lines will be cracked next year when you get into the RV but all of your drains will be cracked so you'll just go and turn on the water and under your sink it all into your basement yeah yeah well you the the worst one that you could ever crack is your shower drain because it's impossible to get to so I was gonna say that that doesn't feel like a part you could easily get to without ripping out the entire yes I've done it it's right at least for me in my Integra it's right above the front drive Wheels by back by the motor uh and it was horrible was absolutely horrible they have since because of work I've done with them put in access door back there that was not there on my co uh the newer is going forward it is now because yeah we all had to figure out how to cut that hole um so saw all welding torch cutting torch kind of all the above I would say was it was a fun week um but yeah you want to avoid that so fair okay so we do have some questions right away here um let's see if I can remember how to put them up uh Vince Walker if you use a v a compressor to blow out the lines how do you deal with the washer and the ice maker good question so on the washer side um you're G to basically uh want to do two things the first thing I do is I dump a half a gallon or so I think the manufacturer instructions will tell you but it's usually around a half a gallon or so of RV antifreeze into the into the basket right and uh we we have an article that goes through my complete winterization checklist and you can save yourself some time if you do it in order so I'm skipping a ton of steps uh the most of the reason why you can skip is because this this antifreeze you're putting in the washing machine is going to go somewhere and you probably want to drain that so if you follow it in order it'll just be faster but um I'll put a link to the blog post here too right in the in the show note in the comments here in a second so you'll want to attach your your air your V air system you're going to want to make sure you've got your winterization kit which is this you're going to want to make sure that you're no higher than 40 to 45 PSI so you're not introducing a high amount of air pressure into your water system which could create leaks um that's why this is so important it gives you that ability to dial in exactly the pressure that you want to give to the system and then you're going to take your washing machine and you're going to put it on the spin rinse cycle it's it's one of the settings on every washing machine and if you don't have one for some reason open up the manual to the washer and look at winterizing because there will be a section on that because even if you're not in an RV you have to winterizer washer in a house it's a very common practice um a dishwasher would be the same but if you put it on spin rinse it's going to turn on the pump and drain and fill what was in the basket through the drain lines and it's also going to open up the water inlet for a minute and it's going to shoot all of the remaining water in those lines out of the lines into the basket and that's how you will uh will drain uh you'll you'll basically fill the uh washing machine's pump with antifreeze and then you will get rid of the inlets with air so that's a that's a good way to do that very cool very cool and then I guess this isn't really a question this is is more of a comment from Tim I've never I never winterize any of my RVs saying that I don't stay in an area where I need to I've stayed in an area that did freeze but just for a short time my tanks are heated so no issues so far yeah any any uh any life lessons there that we might be able to caution against or um yeah let me finish the first question he asked about the ice maker uh oh yeah yeah sorry I didn't I didn't realize yeah sorry I didn't realize you got to that so ice maker is kind of tricky if it's the only thing in your refrigerator um but it's also an interesting device in that it's um well long story short my refrigerator has a water tap on the front of it so when I have the VR connected I will run water through it I'm sorry I'll run the water with the air hooked up until air comes out but before I do that I remove the filter inside of the uh to the machine machine if you don't have a uh water out you may want to consider uh winterizing that with antifreeze and you would basically follow your manufacturer guideline for how to introduce antifreeze into your RV just there's it's different for every unit we can go into the high levels but usually you can use your water pump to basically suck antifreeze in instead of water yeah and then you would just wait for the thing to make a set of ice it's kind of a pain in the it would take longer but um a lot of people don't really take a lot of time to winterize their ice makers because the ice maker little quarter inch line like doesn't really crack I mean that's I don't take my advice on that but it's very squishy and expandable the PVC they use so it's not the end of the world If it freezes basically is what I what I'd say well and and the ice maker itself is designed to freeze stuff so it's sitting in a freezer yes right exactly it's kind of good at that yeah I would I would say it's yeah that would make sense it's kind of hardened against I one I always always forget about and I'm gonna sound like such a snob saying this is the dishwasher yes my RV has a dishwasher I kind of don't need I almost missed the cabinet that my dishwasher was in meaning it's not the the best you know Appliance but you do need to winterize it so just make sure you follow those instructions very very similar pour a bunch of antifreeze RV antifreeze not car antifreeze um and not the other thing to mention is it's not boiler antifreeze either like an Aqua Hot uses something called boiler antifreeze totally different than RV winterization antifreeze which is the cheap stuff you buy at you know Tractor Supply or Home Depot that won't kill you if you happen to drink it even though it doesn't taste very good yeah I don't know what would happen if you would drink glycol anifree the stuff that's in an aqua hot but probably not good no I all I know is I've I've through life mistakes and other things tasted antifreeze by accident that wasn't great um but it didn't taste very good it made you spit it out pretty quick yeah it's uh it's I don't know yeah it's not good yeah the um the key thing oh that does bring me up to another question though we get all the time um which is do I have to to winterize the Aqua Hot system like because you have these little radiators all over the RV they're basically just little blowers they're very similar to a house where you have a radiator on your baseboard these just have fans on the back of them and they blow over a smaller radiator since you don't have as much baseboard and people always are like but how do I winterize that and I'm like you don't have to winterize that that's full of glycol antifreeze so you never have to touch the the hydronic side of your your system you only have to touch the hot water side which is what you'd um hop in your manual and and check your hot water heater winterization so just mechanically thinking that through it's not exchanging hot water it's not running hot hot water from your hot water heater through all of those little radiators it's a separate system that's using a heat exchanger perfect EX exactly yeah there's a whole different uh antifreeze that's in there that prevents corrosion and also if you would not want to run like City water through that it wouldn't last very long if you did so definitely never just go oh I could throw water in that it'll be fine it's not GNA work I mean think about like water cooled PCS and just just even that small of a thing and the the crazy bacteria that goes in those and that and they're circulating they're they're not just stagnant yeah I mean these circulate but um yeah and you can if you use distilled water and you use a concentrated glycol you can do that obviously but um I've just I saw one person use non-distilled water with glycol mixed and the stuff that came out after a year was very Brown like instead of pink he's like yeah it happens every year I'm like it's not supposed to and probably didn't smell great either I've had mine in for three years it's not that color uh so so yeah definitely keep an eye on that so do do you have any um life lesson slash other stories of of things that have gone wrong from not winterizing your uh your RVs in the past or um I've been really lucky um but I can tell you that I did meet one person who forgot to blow out their aquahot system and it was about a $5,500 repair and I won't even call it a repair because he got a salvaged aquaa and replace the whole unit so there are some very small um coils inside that unit that are not serviceable they're like welded right onto the to the body so uh yeah it's it's it's virtually like you're never going to damage your Aqua Hot in a cold environment situation because you simply have to turn it on and you'll be fine even if the rest of the RV freezes your Aqua Hot will keep itself warm it is a heater um so don't worry about that but yeah like don't leave your RV completely parked and stored with an aquahot that hasn't been winterized like and you can flip on the electric you don't have to flip on the diesel burner and it'll still keep itself plenty warm but that's been one of the worst uh little simple easy ones a lot of people's outside showers there's like on every almost every RV there's this thing that no one uses very often except for to like wash down sewer hoses and stuff they call it an outside shower it's more like a just yeah it's an outside faucet and they are I don't know my outside faucet leaks and I'm like uhuh I know why it leaks and it's because when you're in the middle of a winterization procedure that just always gets forgotten because it's like you're out there you don't really it's like what what I don't need to you you just don't think about it because you don't use it very often so yeah that makes i' say the word of wise is before you start make a checklist and think about anything possible that can consume or produce water I meaning consume would be a drain produce would be a tap yeah yeah I mean there's a lot like I mean washing machine ice maker is a good one refrigerator in your uh refrigerator I a water dispenser water dispenser on your countertops are very popular especially in the early 2000 models um uh obviously your standard sink shower outside shower some coaches now are coming with outside water spigot so like you want to hook up a hose somewhere that's a big one especially with like the toy haulers because you like want to hose down your ATV bike yeah yeah that makes sense um or off yourself after dirt biking yeah you know exactly and no matter how many times I winter eyes I can't tell you how frequently I get ready to winterize and at the last steps have forgotten to remove my water filters so there's nothing more fun than having brand new water filters and then running antifreeze through them because they're toast so you've just spent 50 bucks on a set of filters and they're gone so um now P inside for no reason if you have an exterior water filter like our mr3s you're safe safe because you're never going to get antifreeze that far down down line but if you have a one that's fixed mounted you know one of the first things you want to do is take filters out before you uh before you winterize but put the casing back on otherwise you fill up your right well yeah defin yes you take your filters off then you put your empty cases back on or else they will you will shoot antifreeze or air or whatever right out that system that's not uh pressurized or that's not you know what they say right Common Sense isn't that common so you know better to disclose yeah it's not a question of what will go wrong when you're rving it's just a question of which one's going to be first and you know I think we've all probably the first one that everyone does is they hit their head on this bottom of the slide that's like your initiation until you've done that you're not an rver and then uh from then on it's uh just a you have the scar visible there or you know it's hilarious like I've been doing this long enough where it hasn't happened to me in years uh but I am backing out from underneath areas of an RV that have no slides like that's just how I've I'm conditioned to never stand up within three feet of an RV without yeah because it hurts in sailing terms so on when we used to deliver sailboats and car top them we would have these extra long roof racks that go past the edge of the the door cells to fit the boats and the first time you get out of your car and stamp stand up into that into that the end of the Tulie rack and that's that's a memorable experience that right pass exactly I swear I think I still have a dent up here somewhere after I did that I sat in my car for a good five minutes and just was like I need to think about my life choices for a second while I get my br us to what my name is so you know but that's too funny um yeah so we I so I've got the complete list on Winter Rising yep but uh I mean I think a couple highlevel items would be you know make sure you find how to drain your freshwater tank that's that's a kind of a first initial one you're going to find find some drain uh either in a compartment or all the way underneath where it's just a little petcock that's going to allow you to drain that tank um from the low point of it so it actually drains all the way Mak exactly then a lot of RVs most RVs will have something called a lowo drain which is a another petcock that's basically sort of connected to all of the freshwater lines there will be two low Point drains a high and a low and that in theory if your RV is leveled and you opened up your faucets everywhere would allow all the water to drain um out of the RV because everything drains to that low point but I say in theory because it's just not true there's just too many bellies in too many different pipes in too many areas where the lowo drains really don't do what they say they're going to do um which is where you get yourself uh into either wanting to complete that winterization cycle with just antifreeze or if you're like me to do it with uh with air and for me what I do is I do the entire system with air um and we you know we've got an article that goes through it but essentially you're using the V with the winterization system and um you're going you know faucet by faucet and you're you're blowing out all of the different lines both hot and cold until you're really just seeing Air at each of those locations um I first initially keep all my faucets closed open up my low points blow everything out the low point just because it puts less into my graywater tank that I have to then dump again and then I close the load points and I open up each faucet and that gets almost all my water out of the system um which is uh an initially kind of the the way that we we end up doing it and then once I've got it out of there I'll actually um go back and I've put those steps together for my every bus is a little bit different but I'll do my o hot at the very very end and only use so I'll basically tell my RV hey suck in some antifreeze because there's a I just turn a couple knobs and it basically turns my water pump into a suction system uh that will pull an antifreeze but then I'm holding the trigger on my outside shower waiting for that pink on the hot water side so I know it's going to go through my Aqua hot but it's not going to go through the rest of my lines yep okay okay but yeah that's just a way that's worked for me so that I don't have as much antifreeze it also means I don't have to buy five anree I can get the job done with one and a half or so okay okay um in in terms of timing just because and I have no sense of time for how long this process should take the first time you do this it's going to take longer but how how long would you think it would take to do all this I think it's highly dependent on the if you have an Aqua Hot system or not if you don't I'm not even going to make it about the aqua hot it's it's almost like the comp if you have it's very unlikely that you have a dishwasher and a washing machine if you don't have an aquahot those kind of will come together but you know nowadays with newer RVs they're actually probably doing so long story short if you have a larger RV I'd give yourself two hours if you have have a smaller RV i' give yourself an hour and if it's your first time I would double that sadly just because why not do it slower you're probably making your initial checklist you know you're you're gonna find you're gonna do something wrong you're gonna have to double check it I mean I just did mine two weeks ago and then had to come back the next day and do my washing machine because I forgot and you've been doing this for a long time at this point I haven't done winterization that much just because we were usually living in it but yeah it was it's not like just it's not muscle memory for me yet what I love is that my peplink system allows me to log into my Vega touch and turn my heat on so when I realized that I'd forgot I didn't really care I could use my phone to just fire up the heat in my RV again and then I went back to winterizing it again the next deck very cool very cool um yeah I I I I'm not coming up with other major questions that are coming out of this I mean I think that that article was really comprehensive I can say that only because I edited it for you to take out some of the typo stuff but yeah I mean I'd say if I could come up with a couple things that I know I've done wrong one is don't forget to flush your toilet there is water in your toilet even though it's not a faucet so step on that pedal until you see air coming out um uh make sure you dump a gallon of antifreeze down your toilet because you don't want whatever's in there to freeze solid are no fun yeah I mean look you you did clean out your tanks before you started this process so they're clean but nothing's ever that clean so uh and then make sure you uh dump a a fair amount down your your shower drains and your other drains to protect your graywater tanks most of the problems happen on the downstream side on the drains because people forget that they got to add they got to add antifreeze to the traps yeah um and if you come back from uh leaving the vehicle for like a long time just remember that when you're dewinterizing if it smells like gray water and kind of a poopy smell it's because all of your traps and your RV have dried out so there's no longer any liquid in your traps soting creating that vapor lock yeah yeah the exactly once you get a little that's why every when you get into an RV that's been sitting for a while and it smells like gray water it's not that you have a leak or something went wrong it's just that the The Vapor Barrier on your traps is gone because the liquid evaporated so yeah once you get everything going again it'll come back to normal oh that's that's why you have screens and windows to air it all out afterwards anyway right I mean yeah exactly so do you have any plans for travel for this uh for this winter once we get through the holiday season yeah we're we're in a heated family debate about if we're going to Vegas or uh Florida and uh my little one is gonna be four years old uh next year so getting into the Disney well it starts to complicate my life from a where does he go to school perspective so we will most likely be more on the like four to six month travel schedules not the six to eight month travel schedules so you know my wife's like let's go to Florida I'm like you want my last trip to be Florida I'm like and I'm a dad with kids who want to go to Disney so I'm gonna be in Florida for the next four years anyway yeah it's gonna be an annual trip for a long time based on my brother experience and and you know but uh driving to Vegas is is no small feet when it's easier for me driving than it is for her holding two small children while we're driving so I see both sides of the uh the coin so we'll see where we end up um which which which is saki voting for um Vegas or Florida do you think uh I don't think I don't think he cares but I think he would prefer Vegas because that means he gets to eat three hours earlier I like it for those of you who don't know saki is Eric's cat who is personality he's a tour to four in of himself he should have his own Instagram at this point and in uh 45 no he's got one more year so he's gonna turn 19 in April and then he'll be 20 the year after if he decides to Grace us with his presence that long he doesn't seem like he's going anywhere doesn't look 20 but yeah he's no I mean the last time I saw picture of me doesn't look any different than when I took photos of him 10 years ago so just a you know do do a lot so I guess you last a while when You' kind of just keep it simple yeah yep well Vince Vince uh did give a followup just thanks for the info um he did have a question how how much how many gallons of RV antifreeze you typically want to buy for you know a Class A or large RV uh for a large RV I always buy five or six it comes in a six-pack at Home Dep um and you that would be if you're going to do a full winterization including all the lines uh you can cut that down by two to I I can get away with two gallons if I use air um but I'm always a little more generous with the drains that's where I use most of it not the lines because I'm just like a I just want to make sure there's enough in the because I have mass rating toilets and I'm like how long is that masterating discharge line like I flush it once was one one enough flush did I get all the way to the end so I'll flush it twice and there goes a gallon with two big flushes so um so yeah I think that's but I can't imagine going through more than five honestly I just buy the sixpack because it's easier to carry than five and then I usually have yeah it comes in like a cardboard box yep cool very cool but yeah if you're using air it's it's one one to two Max I'd say on a regular travel trailer you don't need it for anything you're just using it on the drains yep and you're done like you're all set um on a on a larger one maybe two two to three tops but yeah I would just I don't I prefer using air 100% of the time I just think it's so much easier to dewinterize when you've got air rather than antifreeze yeah just a lot less liquid to deal with I would think yep absolutely so uh just one other point to mention is that the four 400 and the 450 so those are your kind of larger buyers that look kind of like this let's kind of here I'll I'll give you a bigger stage here to yeah that's your the that's your units that are going to support winterization they're going to be able to have that continuous air pressure output and then the winterization kit here is really what you're getting is you're getting a a control here that allows you to dial in exactly what air pressure you're using and then you're getting a garden hose adapter here that's going to be able to go right into your standard water inlet and then you're getting the gauge obviously that's going to tell you exactly what's going on so what you're you're really doing is just to give you a high level on the VY stuff is you're hooking this all up before you hook up to the system like hook your your V up hook this up to the V and then dial your pressure down counterclockwise is down to that 45 PSI because once you hook it up into the system all the numbers here are going to drop to something super low and it's you you don't have to adjust it after you just adjust it when the system's unplugged get it right and then plug in the system and it will stay at that that regulated pressure even even though the gauge is going to go down to like 20 something and the reason why it matters is because if you it'll go down to 20 because you have something open somewhere right because it's pushing because it's pushing stuff out yeah that makes sense but you know if you close all the valves the pressure is just going to grow and grow and grow and grow and this is what's going to protect you I used to do it without this um and it's just you're just playing it's let me put it this way way easier with two people if you want to try to do it without this because someone could at least stay outside keep an eye but um it's just not worth it for 39 bucks just the Kit's great it comes together and um and it and it really does everything you needed to do and if you bought this this and this at Home Depot which they actually all sell these individual pieces although they're brass not stainless uh it comes out to like $5 less so and then you got to put it together so I don't think they're they're being unreasonable with their with their price amount on it it's pretty pretty decent well and at least you know it works at that point versus like maybe you got a fitting that's the wrong size or something else we've for all of us that have tried to DIY stuff too many times right you know yeah I mean this is certainly not there's nothing here that I would say is patentable but but uh by by Vi but uh they did a really nice job putting it together and and it and it just fits really well and easy into the bag and does everything I need to so I've been really happy but um but yeah it's uh it's it's the reason why I have the 450 a lot of people ask why didn't why the 400 or the 450 and I go W the 450 and they go why and I go because it's got an unlimited duty cycle which means it can technically Run Forever um the 400 has I think it can run for 40 minutes without needing a break which is honestly more than enough for you to winterize your RV but uh and it actually pumps a little bit faster okay 400 is less money and pumps faster but no unlimited duty cycle so it's up to you what's more important for you I'd rather have it pump a little slower but no it can kind of go forever because I also think it's probably working a little bit less hard because it's not trying to push so much air so fast but um I don't think there's a right answer Andy has the 400 and loves it I have the 450 and love it and so far I have not found anyone who's gotten the 400 to actually shut off so maybe that one is the better one since you know I don't I've never seen the duty cycle ever be hit so I guess it is just a faster pump for less money but I'll go with 450 it's up to up to everybody well I mean you know I still subscribe to the uh the Tim the toolman Taylor the bigger the number the better right that's you know kind of missed that show oh totally the uh that was that was a good one mower that had like the Chevy big block edine in it or whatnot that was pretty oh [Laughter] yeah well I used to I used to live in Connecticut in the same town as Paul Newman and he had a a Volvo station wagon with a small blog V8 in it that he would drive around you could hear him coming for a while it was pretty funny so that is awesome well I I don't want to hold you for too long because I know I know you're a little under the weather and and we but I do appreciate yeah yeah I'm the one with tea but you know I figured uh I figured we we did want to get this out there before the holidays just because I think a lot of people will try and winter eyes we questions they can always pop over and if the team doesn't know they just message me and say hey what's what's the status with this we don't mind and answering any questions and and uh you know just make sure you uh follow those instructions in the guide post that we have and then just make sure to do a once over in the winterization section in the uh user manual for your RV and remember that uh you want to cross check not only the user manual in the RV but also the manual for your uh hot water heater system yeah uh your uh dishwasher if applicable and your washing machine if applicable okay because I have not yet found a user manual from a manufacturer that when you read the winterization instructions they don't reference how to do those those other devices Monaco is one of the better ones they actually will reference like hey and if you have a washing machine go figure that out um but a lot of them just totally skip it so just make sure you if it has water in it find the manual from that device and check it because it's not like oh it's not listed here I can just skip it no you can't nope nope no you can't it has water in it it's still GNA have something it's going to freeze yeah you can SK it it just may not work in the spray or may lead to a very nasty answer like problem I have replaced a washing machine in an RV it is about as much fun as it sounds yeah yeah well what I like what do you mean the door what do you mean the doorway is 27 inches in the in the washing Ma's 28 inch how did they get this thing in here you they put it in before the doorway was in there yeah they're getting better they're getting better I have not seen that in a in a 2000 on RV but I have seen it in older ones where I'm like they built this room around this suppliance I cannot believe this well I've seen people do that with homes too where you know you build the couch you build you put the couch together in the room knowing it's never gon to leave you know but they uh they installed the big double door um refrigerator in uh in all Integra coaches obviously they when they install it they're probably doing it before the walls come up the first one but when they do repairs they actually go in through the driver's side toll booth window so that's kind of an interesting they'll actually forklift it over the steering wheel in to get a new refrigerator in U and they'll take the whole front windshield off basically no not the windshield they'll take the side window out it's easier uh in certain floor plans they yes they have to take the front windshield out but they've they've figured out that it's much easier to take the side toll booth window like when you pay a toll y um that window that's where they can bring a a full 36 inch wide refrigerator through so yeah never seen it done but heard about it a lot of times from the technicians we talked to are like oh yeah that's that's a fun day yeah just just give them a GoPro next time they say they're going to do that job because I want to watch that that's a I've tried there's there's uh like so when you go to drop your RV off at least with Integra uh they will you will be asked if you have any cameras in the vehicle and and if they find them or see them they will tape over them uh so they do not want any recording going on during their uh inside of their Factory I mean that's that's fair too in the sense that you know you sign up to be a maintenance tech for integrity don't necessarily want to be a YouTube Star I could I could I mean I I imagine some of it's around liability but I actually think a lot of it's around trade secret stuff they don't want people stuff but it's probably both so yeah you know we all do what our insurance companies tell us to do I guess this is this is very true us included so yeah my least favorite call oh what do the lawyers want think about this we try not to make that call as often as possible they are no fun no no no they are not very cool yeah so good good times sorry I sound like I'm sick because I am yeah no that's okay and and uh just thanks for uh for joining us and and answering the the questions that came up I think that's that's really helpful for people and this will exist on our YouTube channel as a reference as a followup I'll add this to the uh to the article so for anyone who's not aware we're running our December giveaway promo uh right now through the end of December uh what is essentially means if you shop on our store any any purchase of $250 or more will unlock free gifts uh so there's different gift tiers 250 I think 500 a, 2500 so depending on if you were thinking about buying something uh anyway and you're like oh man I don't know what to get my dad for Christmas or something like that this could be an interesting opportunity the gifts are pretty cool um like you can unlock a v uh compressor at the higher tier so I mean they're not you know we're not throwing like free calendars um they're they're they're pretty no no more beanies with headlights on them oh no that's that's in there that's TI one if you spend two 250 you get a beanie which is I that beanie is incredibly useful it's annoyingly useful I know I don't I'm like do I have one around I don't have mine anywhere here but yeah mine's in the RV where I need it uh but yeah whenever I'm going out to and I'm freezing and I got to go dump the tanks I can press my little button on my hat and it's I'm I'm good to go yep so just a reminder that that's going on through uh the end of the month and as

{"id": "xsX0MyOnous", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "NTM7AwrQIVQ7YHjnKx-Qdu6QQik", "transcript": "good afternoon everyone welcome back to mobile mus have live my name is Dave I the director of special projects for mobilus have.com and today we have our fearless head of marketing Andy the man Murphy here hi guys Andy what are we talking about today so today we wanted to talk about Black Friday as we are kind of an online store so Black Friday is consuming the world of e-commerce um basically for the month of November so wanted to talk about the particular um items we have on sale kind of highlight why certain things are on sale what they're good for and I think there's some really good deals on right now so just kind of wanted to talk about that and very good and as always if you guys if you guys have questions about anything please feel free to post it in the comments I will get back to you and we'll try and answer them as we go here but this one is a great Q&A overall because we're going to be covering so many different topics just because of such a wide sale so please ask questions if you if you have any yeah absolutely so uh what's what's what's what's first what's the first thing that that is I know these sales are all by the way I just want to note before we start that I think all these sales are live at this point correct oh yeah that's what I was going to cover first everything is um everything we're going to talk about is currently on sale this is not a pre view of any sort so you can go on mobile mav.com and the main image that loads if you click on the shop now will take you to our Black Black Friday collection um so if you did kind of want to scroll through this as we're sitting here talking you are welcome to do that and then ask any questions um the first uh we have a couple categories so I'll say the categories first and then we can dive deeper into each category ex me the first one that we'll talk about is internet then I want to talk about surge protection um Tire safety as we have two different um versions of Tire uh we have TST and our V product lines are on sale and then we have all of our cable entry Solutions um also on sale so kind of break that out but um yeah so kind of those main was it five four four or five collections uh on so again you can see that all on our site very cool well so um do you want to walk through sort of category by category as far as like what the actual sales are yeah so we have and I'll start with the internet and we have a couple main um really good routers we've got four main routers currently on sale um the first one is going to be the transit Pro Duo it is a dual LTE modem um it is if you were going to say what router would you suggest getting started with if you're traveling um this is the number one it's $200 off so it's 20% off it's usually $9.99 um so it's Rock Bottom pricing it's a really good deal on that router it's the best it's the best deal we've we've had on that router um and our top recommendation you're getting started um we all started with this Transit Duo so it's a really good one um it is LTE so it's not 5G but LT has gotten so fast with 5G um really taking bandwidth off of Lte so it would be what I recommend um you're gonna have good you're gonna have good band support LT you're gonna have AT&T uh Verizon and Team level support it's certified on all of those networks it's just a super Sol it also works great with starlink because has the upgraded processor it is a very solid device and that is the peplink transit Pro Duo that that's that one the next one um is going to be the bance 20x um it's a great entrylevel device or if you are in a rural home or small business that's where this kind of device um where it was designed for it comes with a a pretty entrylevel modem built in but what's really great about the the balance 20 is it has an expandable Port so you can add in additional modems to make it a dual modem uh router so you can add in a 5G you could add in a mid-range one if you wanted to go like a cat 12 or something more basic um so very customizable that one is also a little more feuture prooof because you can always add in more a different module if you want to change it out um it does have Starling support You' got that Wan connection um it has Wi-Fi as Wan now uh with the new firmware um so it's a good option it's bigger it's not necessarily designed to be mobile U but could be a good option if that's if that feature set kind of fits your needs but a good example would be like let's say let's say you live in an RV but you also have a home if you want want to add peplink capability fairly reasonably to your home it's not a bad way to go it's a good option I know our owner Eric has a couple balance 20xs sitting around um his house as he has like stationary locations as well as his RV so it's definitely a good unit um and and one that yeah they've just upgraded to the cat 7 base so yeah it's a solid unit now there are two other ones um and it's in the uh the br1 kind of Series so the br1 and the BR R2 um the main different and actually I have a br2 sitting here um they are basically they're very similar in their 5G units so this is a br2 unit um and the br1 is very similar but it's single modem this is the br2 this is going to be two modems um and with this series everything is 5G so if you really were focused on 5G and wanted to go 5G you've got you know this br1 or br2 line is what you're looking for now there two flavors sorry just just to clarify that a little bit that's the br1 pro and the br2 pro right br1 Pro and the br2 pro so br1 is for one modem br2 is this one this is dual mod we have so many antennas on this one um it is a dual 5G modem uh now for both of those you have two flavors I just did a like a new version a refresh um the new one is the x62 5G chip so you still have two modems and the you you the same br1 or br2 but you're going to see a new x62 and that is the new chip um if you're looking for the latest and greatest that would be it the br2 x62 chip is the latest and greatest out of peplink um right now the Big Black Friday sale on this is for the br2 x62 chip you're going to get $400 off it's typically $28.99 and now it's $24.99 you have a $400 rebate if you have a tradeing device um so if you have an old modem an old hotspot anything that connected to the internet that you're no longer using you can send us a serial number of that device say that's what you're trading in and you can get $400 off now if you don't have one of those uh old units sitting around we have some and we're selling them for a dollar so if you needed one just let us know customer service and we can we can make sure you have access to a training device through want $400 off these now the br1 x62 also is running a Black Friday sale and they've extended the Prime Care um access to it so Prime Care think of it like an extended warranty so it it is um every purchase comes with one year Prime Care with the br1 for Black Friday it's going to a twoyear so it's it comes included with two years versus just one year um so like that's like 10 you know I don't know the price of prime care for that particular amount I think it's usually like 120 bucks sound that sounds about right just because I I just looked up the br2 pro the other day for a customer and I think that was 249 so 120 something would it's around 120 I can look it up so you're going to get that extra so you don't have to think about it for two whole years um and that's on the br1 x62 now we have the older version the x55 so that's the br1 x55 and the br2 pro x55 um and those are both 15% off if you wanted to just get a little bit older and a little bit of a steeper deal those are great options that are there so you can see the latest price on our website if you go search that so just make sure if you're looking at one of these 5G units you're looking at the right one x55 is the older one and then x62 was the new one got it got it well those that's uh that that's that's a really nice set of deals I I just want to point out for the for the x62 versions of the br1 pro and br2 pro you're talking about a device that came out literally weeks ago three weeks ago I think is what we talked about yeah so very and also if you have any questions about the differences between those two versions uh we do have a live stream from a couple weeks ago where we had Chris and Sheree from mobile interet Resource Center and they did a great comparison that talks about what are the advantages of an x62 chip versus an x55 chip and I think that's a if you if you're not sure that's a great place to start in terms of reference and you can find that on our YouTube channel under live stream past live streams or under Facebook as well on on our group there I mean what from a marketing standpoint what I was excited about is these are the four top most selling routers we've got and we were able to get them into Black Friday um so we're not selling routers that we don't typically move that much or or routers that don't you we don't necessarily recommend these are our number one recommended routers and the ones we were able to get into to Black Friday so uh yeah just something I wanted to point out I I just one more thing I just wanted to say there too this isn't one of those Black Friday sales where we're only selling the first two devices at that sort of low price either this is one of those Black Friday sales where we're going to sell them as for that time period whether we have them in stock or not right I think so I think for the peplink yeah I mean we have enough of these where I'm not I mean stock you know there is a limit but we have enough to where if you are focused and you don't wait till the last day you should definitely be a look at one yep awesome the last internet related one is the paric um aita light this is a relatively new antenna that came out the summer for us it's designed to be completely inside mounted it is rated to be outside mounted so if you want to put it outside that's fine um but the idea is it comes with six feet of cable you can mount it High inside a cabinet above the pep link um all inside you can just velcro it to the wall if you wanted and um you can really improve your reception from the Ping padle antennas that we you know see here um so that antenna I don't remember the price on that one um but that is a great option if you're looking for not necessarily doing any roof installs or anything complicated on the roof this one you can stick high up in a corner um and it does a really good job of improving reception I will say big disclaimer though make sure you don't have any metal in the walls of your RV so airstreams are where there's metal outside some manufacturers are putting metal in the installation layers though so make sure you you don't even have any like tin foil or metal coatings on any of the insulation um if you're looking at that you got to get outside if you've got a metal box but yeah if you're in fiberglass and just kind of foam then it works well yep no that's great I mean the aita I I think Mark has still ranked the aita as one of their best performing antennas for the situation so yeah and I'll just say the so this is the aita light specifically um the only difference between the light and the not light the regular aita is the cables that come down the light uses slightly thinner cables which make them routing those cables very easy to do inside and at six feet you're not going to have really any noticeable loss over that length especially with a thinner cable the regular AA has thicker cables so you have less loss over a long distance that's why you can do 15 feet with that uh with that antenna that we don't necessarily offer with the light because you just you have loss at that at that level um so the a light we we've kind of geared to be the inside Mountain to okay very cool very cool awesome so that covers the internet section for us what uh what's what what's next uh so the next one would be our surge protectors so uh we do full RV surge protection um we have the Hugh autof form power Watch Dog collection as a traveler I've tested all different kinds of surge units I have gone through a couple myself um and we absolutely love the power Watchdog units um so that's why we started selling them and partnering with them um we have the full lineup on sale um it's 15% off it is cheaper than what you're seeing on Amazon and anywhere else so it's definitely a great deal um the ones and I I have a short video coming out on YouTube probably either later today or tomorrow if you want to like see more about this um but they're the units that will plug right into the pedestal and then your RV power cable will plug right into those so I've got the pedestal mounted ones we also have direct wire ones so if you wanted to wire it into your electrical system so you just are you don't even have to think about it you don't even ever see it we've got those options too they're for 50 amp RVs and then there's a 30 amp RV option um so those are kind of your main units but the whole line is on sale so you have extra surge units like what's great about the power watch do is if you have a surge event um and it blows your surge protector it will stay online but you're no longer surge protected and you can just buy a new surge unit just the actual module you don't have to get a whole new box um so even those are on sale if you want to stock up on those we have all their accessories from volt meters that you can plug in and check your voltage uh to their multimeters which is actually my favorite multimeter I've ever had um they did a really good job with their with that uh so a great lineup of stuff if you have any need for a new uh a new surge protector um now there's actually a couple features I didn't talk about which we can just highlight so one is on your phone there is an app um for the surge protector which is super cool let me pull that up power and so you can see at any point in time connect connect uh what your what Your usage is so I can camera Focus but it'll get there but you can see like I'm on a 50 amp so I have two lines and I can see what my actual watts is I can see my amps I can see the frequency um and the volts so I can I can always monitor from my phone it is Bluetooth so you can't be anywhere and monitor it but as long as I'm on Bluetooth I can see that I've used it more in the summer when I'm watching AC loads because I have three AC's and then I'm charging an inverter and stuff uh where the winter it is it is usable in the winter too because I have two electric heaters so we want to make sure we're balancing power and all that so it has it has been beneficial but um if you go with um this all of the units have Bluetooth and then if you go with the slightly bigger units they're going to have EPO which means emergency power off if you are in a place that has low voltage um these will shut off power to your RV and that will save your appliances in um if there is low voltage you don't want to go below like 108 volts um that can really mess with your AC compressors it can be what starts off fire in your electric heaters because they don't have enough energy or electricity to create the heat um so having emergency power off can be um can be really important that sounds like I I I know we were really excited when we got Watchdog on board that was a that's a cool product line for us so that's nice to see there on sale too so that's the power side of things the power side of things yeah I do want to just uh point out we did have one comment um from a customer talking about um I think they're trying to buy the TST flow through sensors and the discount is showing off a little different than what their end price would be if you do have questions like that this is one this is a great place for it but two just please live chat with our customer service staff they are more than happy to help you either manually apply the discount or um refund you if something is wrong after you make a purchase if you notice that that something's wrong too where we'll we'll all we always want to give you the benefit of Doubt there so I will say though it looks like that comment might have a membership related comment the M we the we were able to get such good deals with the manufacturer it outpaced what our normal membership discounts are uh so the membership it doesn't stack in this case because we're at normal membership discounts are depending on which level you get around 10% these are 15 to 20% um discounts so in most cases they're not going to stack and that might be might be what the issue is I I'd have to look into it um but yeah these are not stacking with members because the deals are so good anyways um it's better this this is the better deal you want you want this deal versus just the members yeah we can talk about memberships at the end but we don't want and we don't want to punish someone having a membership either like they get that discount instead of the black everyone has access to 15 or 20% or whatever it is yeah y yeah Okay cool so that covers power uh I think that's a good lead into the the TST next then since since we're on safety sure um so t TST we can so TST is 15% off uh again it's the full line of TST we've got the standard flow through or cap sensors um which we talk about the difference of those we also have the in tire sensors so if you're getting new tires put on that's actually a good option no one can take them because it's literally inside the rubber um and a lot of our vs are starting to come with that so if you need any additional um additional sensors it can be a good way to add to make your RV complete like I know I have a a dual truck and a triaxle trailer my since my truck was over 10,000 pounds the government says I didn't need a gpms um included so there was no tire system on the truck so I have six sensors on the truck six sensors on the trailer and I actually have two for each spare so I have um what is that 14 total uh and so all of those sensors are 15% off you can get the kits we sell in a couple different ways you can buy it in a kit where you get the screen the repeaters all the parts to get completely set up and you can buy that for four tires Six Tires eight tires and then you can add on additional ones if you need so buy sets of two uh so if you need 14 tires you could do that um you can mix and match uh your flow through sensors and your cap sensors it's no problem um it's all comes down to really what type of Tire you're putting the sensor on um if your tire has a metal stem so the part where you were going to put air in if that is metal you can go with the flow through sensors if it's rubber you do the cap sensors and the cap sensors will also work on metal but you have to have metal for the flow through uh it's because they weigh more so you just have to have a little bit more Force to hold them on um yeah so the everything is 50 so if you want to add a couple sensors if you want to upgrade currently are pick up spares you could do that uh the what I love about the T T stuff is is the batteries are replaceable so you don't really need spares unfortunately for us uh you can just replace the batteries but we have O-rings if water ever got into one you want to replace the ring for your batteries you can do that we don't sell batteries for these um because that's just it was we just didn't need to but you the batteries I'm finding last about two years I just replaced all of mine all of my batteries and I think it's probably a three-year old system so they're fairly standard battery sizes too though right I mean little no I just ordered them on Amazon they're like little round ones and it's like 15 I can get the number if I need to but it's like start with a 15 for uh for the battery size um the good news is when you take out the old one it's printed on the battery so that it isint that's where I always find them when I need to order new ones so yeah yep um but yeah whole lineup is 15% off so it is a great time good stocking stuffer you're looking for something yeah there you go for I I will say I mean TST was something we created mobile mus have with around internet and TST they came out from the beginning and it's definitely a must have for us traveling on the road not knowing the uh the condition of my tires while driving was super scary and knowing that if I had an issue one's going to heat up and I can get that sensor alert immediately um it's really important so if are traveling and you don't have a way to monitor your tires before you buy anything else definitely get this because everyone that has an RV will have a tire go out on you it's it's not a matter of if it's a when and so this can really help make sure if you have a tire go out you know immediately before it's caused an issue or you can catch it before it actually creates an issue if you have a blowout it could blow out your whole side fender um and so you don't want that to happen you'll know if you've got one of these if you're having a pressure issue if you're having a heat issue isue um if there's if something's hit a tire and has caused something to go wacky these sensors are telling you that so they're really important to have well and I would also think that as you transition like we were talking about the other day you're sort of in your pro your slow migration South I think to to get to more sunlight and you know you you don't want to be up in the cave dwellers with us up here in the Northeast for the winter I which I totally respect and understand and um but uh you know as you change climates I would think your tire pressure you sort of need to be aware of that as as you transition just like we all have a dead battery when it gets really cold um you'll have a your tire sensors will go off too so yep it's definitely something good to have and when I have a low tire or I've gotten that notification from TST I use our V system to fill up what an impressive transition I love that I'm gonna give you some Applause for so the V Systems are also 15% off which we super excited that we were able to offer that it's the first year we've been able to do that with fire um it is I mean for me Tire safety is so critical um not not to be salesy by any stretch but before starting working here and before all of this this was stuff I had already purchased this was stuff I was like you have to have it in the RV you have to know when your tires are going to have an issue and that's what the sensors are for and you have to be able to solve the issue when you have one and then that's where the V stuff comes in so they are 150 psi designed um pressure uh entire inflators and they do their job to the best and they're very portable a lot of people I've met on the road have these big like U lows husky brand um Tire or like inflation units they're very loud they wake everybody up in the morning um and they're bulky You' got to have a large amount of space to kind of carry that these are very compact um trying to think like they would fit inside a three gallon bucket if I had like a it's about that size um so very small um they they they are Hefty because they're made out of good quality materials but they're not overly heavy um and yeah I use mine I would say twice a month filling up some tire that's low or something I can also fill up bike tires with it or basketballs or any of the crap the kids have on them um and so it's just very very um portable and it works on 12vt directly so I just plug it into either the RV house batteries or the truck batteries and then with the hose is I think 100 feet so you can get to everything without moving the power source around nice that's that's and and viair to me is sort of the gold standard for that stuff for for rving at this point it's what they're I mean they we only carry the RV line but they've got compressors that are designed to be like built into you know to underneath your truck um they've got inline compression to do you know like for Jeeps and things that want to change their pressure while they're they've got crazy stuff we we just focus on the RV line but yeah they they are definitely the owners of that space got it got it very cool all right so we've done internet we've done power and search protection we've done Tire safety is there anything else uh there is let's see let me check my not well no so that's it actually that is kind of your your main line up got your internet I'm just checking my full list yeah that's all of them that's what we've got that's I that's that's the biggest Black Friday we've ever had um so I'm very excited that it kind of has all come together oh water filtration yeah Hunter just totally got us yeah we don't so blue blue specifically is not doing anything yet for water um filtration we did run a big uh Prime day in October um sale for that so they these sales a lot of them are run by the manufacturers and we're just kind of passing them through um but I no water yet we'll see if they come in on maybe that Black Friday holiday specifically y yep okay very good well thank Hunter thank you for that question we really do appreciate it and um yeah absolutely yeah sorry sorry there isn't more of a discount there yet but if there is we will certainly announce it and put it on the site for sure so yeah um if anybody is interested in the Vier stuff there's different levels I don't we've covered in a couple videos so I don't want to cover it here but unless someone had the question specifically if like what type of RV you had and which which one there's four different levels of V so if anybody's interested that might be fun to cover but yeah absolutely yeah I don't think we've we have not done a tire inflation live stream yet I think that's probably bat and Watchdog I think the two we haven't really covered yet okay but okay oh you know what we did miss one it's iotech um entry our uh our our famous German friends yeah so this this is a new product we launched two weeks ago um and it's actually nothing that expensive or fancy but it took us forever to figure it out so I'm really excited we finally way would like bring it to Market if you have if you've ever been in an RV or installing something you might have something on your roof and you want to bring it inside it could be your starlink antenna could be one of our antennas could be a we boost there's so many different I've tried a couple different ways to do it um and it's always challenging creating a watertight solution through your outside into your inside um and a lot of grommets are questionable um and then you have to also have the tips and the grommets make sure your cable ends go through and then they tighten off it's been it's been a challenge so we found iotech solution um and that's just the manufacturer even then we had a hard time figuring out exactly how to buy them what they were um and after installing them ourselves personally on RVs and then a couple influence RVs and like personal installs we've done um we've absolutely Fallen love with them and to solve the purchasing problem we created bundles so depending on what type of antenna you buy from us we've created bundles that will perfectly match the right cable size to the right grommet size you don't have to figure out that math um and then we've paired it with housings that are just simple and easy so we have um so for an install example if you're installing something on a roof we typically put a box a junction box like a 12 by 12 by4 junction box Up on the Roof you can put the entire an right on that junction box if you want or you can put the antenna off to the side and have the wires go sideways into the junction box and when the wires go into the junction box that's been the water that's been the cable water problem is how do you keep rain out of this box when you've got cable going and that's where this iicot Tech solution um really solves the problem we just did a YouTube video last week really showing how this comes together so you could watch that after this live don't leave me but do it afterwards um and you can see it's actually putting it all together it slides in you don't have to cut the ends off of any cables you can put it anywhere you could put it right on the roof you can put it in the Box you've got a couple different options um so that could be that's 20% off all the iotech stuff um and I think even our bundles are like 45 bucks or $50 so there's it's not a big spend but it can be a real solution if you're struggling with cable entry oh and in our bundles we've got options for all starlink option all starlink antennas so whether it's the um the dishy the little rectangle dishy one or the high performance that we sell directly um we have all the grommets so that that can work directly with uh the bundles we have okay very cool and we have another question here um Let me show I'm going to show this one on the screen just because I think it'll help sure uh I have a b van uh I currently have a watchdog 30 amp mobile and a 30 foot smart plug cord that I use on the road I also have a um I guess there's no real question there mark did you have a question that goes with that or did I just jump the gun here sorry that's a classic of doing this live and reading the realiz smart plugs are cool we have a video coming out on the smart plug cord um so but yeah basically the when you plug it into your RV the plug will tell you if there's any ground ISS issues or uh neutral problems or anything so you don't have to like watch for error codes on the watch doog itself um that's a cool product too yep very cool that's that's a nice setup oh wait here's the uh he's considering adding a longer cord want to know if a fixed Watchdog would be the right right for the application um so there's two types of Watch Dogs here there is the one that goes on the pedestal you're not ring any length though you're adding I mean maybe a maybe a foot and a half um I I have that option I don't have really enough room to install one in my bay I also haven't had time so I just go to my not not as uh for the home well so I I think my answer is gonna work either way because like I go to the pedestal so wherever I'm getting power from whether that's an RV camp when I've gotten to like Eric's Campground like doesn't matter I can plug in my my watch dog and then I plug the Irv into so it's just this it's the thing in between um Eric has actually installed the hardwired one inside his class A so he takes his regular extension cord that comes out of his class on the fancy reel that I don't have and he'll just plug in to whatever receptacle is there and at the end of The Reel is where the Watchdog is but it's inside his coach a lot of people will do that if they're concerned about security of where they're plugging in or something like that so the cord can't ever really be taken because it's like installed in his RV and it's just plugging the receptacle um so if you're concerned about security of of your surge protective Unit A lot of people just install the hardwire one it's not a hard install um we're have a video I think Eric just recorded a video of him installing his so we're hoping to get that out soon but it's the same unit it's just do you want it in front of your power plug or do you want it inside and that's really what it comes down to it's the same housing same unit overall though got it got it okay very cool well Mark yeah the answer is yes it would be the right application but you just have to figure out where you want are you okay with it being on the outside um or do you want it in you know plugged into like wired into the electronics of your van either is either either will work and and as always Mark if you have sort of more detailed questions and you want to talk with someone you can schedule a phone call with one of our customer service staff or you can email us at info@ mobilus have.com or during store hours you can also live chat with our customer service team as well so very cool you're are now glowing orange Andy the day I'm using a window for my light and it's slowly dying so I'm trying to bring in some more light over here no that's okay it's a good I think it's a good transition actually we're we're going to have a start to have a new segment on these live streams called the customer Spotlight and so the we we met uh the customer that I'm going to feature in this video here this video package here in a second uh yes it's pre-recorded which is why I look different and that's fine um is uh yeah his name's Darvin Darin uh lives uh has started a a business where he is literally streaming High local high school sports in the small town where he lives uh for the the people of that town because as as he said a lot of the people in that town uh don't can't necessarily travel the hours to go see aot a football game on a Friday night and and they still but they still want to be a fan and be a supportive fan so he's using some of the stuff that we said including the transit Pro I want to point out uh as his solution for being on the road versus what he used to use which was just a simple hotspot so I'm gonna both of us are going to sort of jump off the stage here and then then I will play the video if I can do this correctly on on H streamyard bear with me if I screw it up I'm sorry that this is live and we're still learning as we go but uh here we go let's see what happens so uh nice to meet you obviously we we we really appreciate you taking the time to work with us and and talk about this the solution you've used our products for uh tell me a little bit about yourself yeah thanks so much um and and thank you as well for uh an opportunity to come and chat I um have had a it's been a great experience so far working with mobile musthave I found the customer service to be super helpful I've tried to like I'm trying to like solve a problem that there is no direct straight line website to you know step me through how to do all these things and your sales and support staff have been super helpful just helping me problem solve through the the purchase that I made I live in rural Iowa and Central Iowa um and I run a a broadcasting live streaming business for our that broadcasts High School sports through our local local high school so I follow our teams around during football volleyball basketball and wrestling seasons and bring live video coverage of our High School varsity teams during those Seasons both when we're at home here in in t Iowa and um when we're away all throughout the state and the the region I we go an hour two hours away depending on the season and so that kind of is what led me to the peplink product into investigating kind of what mobile must have uh has last year I started Ed doing video broadcasting as part of the business and that sort of required additional internet connection access and I used just a a small US Cellular Hotpot that I just found at a at a cell phone retailer and when I didn't have local Wi-Fi available that would be my internet source so if I am out maybe 200 300 yards away from a high school next to a cornfield at a football field somewhere um which some of our football fields are right right in the rural areas there you they they don't have Wi-Fi that comes out there and so then I have to just kind of cross my fingers and hope that last year anyway that the cell coverage that I had on that Hots spot was going to be right for that situation sometimes it was sometimes it wasn't and so there were a few times last year where my broadcast dropped out I lost video signal altogether and I had to restart the broadcast there were even a couple where I didn't I wasn't able to get back on at all I just had no I had no internet whatsoever or it would be where I would show up two three hours before game time and when I'm speed testing before the stadium fills up everything seems great and then all of a sudden maybe it's senior night maybe it's you know youth football league night and you know hundreds of fans show up and start kind of clogging down the cell phone tower that that is you know getting used and uh and all of a sudden my signal just nose Dives so that kind of led me to trying to figure out a different solution that could give me more flexibility and keep me on the air so I kind of offer YouTube and Facebook live streaming um we're on for about an hour and a half to three hours uh even do some tournaments I just did a volleyball tournament uh two weekend ago and that was like a six-h hour broadcast and so it kind of varies in how long and when and where I'm at but uh it's kind of the the remote um mobile aspect of it solution did you go with yeah from mobile must have so I went with the road warrior bundle and that gave me a peplink Transit Duo router and a husky antenna and it also came with a mounting bracket the the antenna did I particularly was interested in the transit Duo because it had two modems um which would allow me to have multiple carriers multiple SIM cards from different carriers and be able to use them simultaneously I was really looking for a product that would Bond multiple Wi-Fi or Internet signals together I'm not an expert in any of that um and so I kind of had to research my way through how does all this work how do I go about finding a product that'll um suit my needs the first places that I came to were more broadcast or corporate broadcast quality products um that were they seemed you know like they could work for my situation and of course a lot of those companies and places they don't give you the pricing straight away so I kind of had to do some customer servicing and investigating and then I get the pricing finally after the pitch and it's all like okay yeah that's way too that's I'm just a I'm I'm a single person trying to like go around and broadcast High School sports with small cameras and you know I'm very far away from a a TV production yeah and so it was those things were just way out of my budget I had kind of been looking through some different Facebook groups and online forums that um that I had kind of gotten tied in with and and had been recommended uh the peplink routers as a solution that could do some internet bonding um be pretty durable um be pretty um kind of um sturdy units that could could be taken out and and be used in a mobile sort of setting and that's kind of what got me to finding mobile mus have um and finding the uh I think is it the mobile internet Resource Center that the website you guys kind of do some partnering with and um was really just impressed in the kind of breadth of of information and and uh and help that that those both your site and their site kind of had as far as um you know pepling products and mobile internet Solutions so really kind of thought that the the transit Duo would be a good sort of price point for my budget um I felt definitely comfortable with with where that was at it was you know not a ton less I mean it was it was enough um less than those other you know um more corporate solutions that kind of made me pull the trigger on it and also having um you know an antenna that could kind of go out and and give me some some distance um to be able to kind of get the receiving the receivers kind of out from um you know Press Box if I'm in a football Press Box that was helpful as well yeah those those those High School football uh press boxes are probably there's lots of metal in the construction of those and would make receiving Wi-Fi pretty difficult sometimes or even cellular signals right yeah exactly so last year my home the the Press Box at our home stadium um we get we can get Wi-Fi from our school building which is about 150 yards away it reaches the door of the Press Box and then dies completely um and so I would tilt my little hot spot out the window and just make a feeble attempt to kind of get get me connected inside the the building with the hot spot that's kind of pointed outside and it kind of worked and it kind of didn't and so now I've got uh an antenna that can go either e on the roof or out maybe mounted to the bleacher the top of the bleachers um something to that effect and it allows me to receive local Wi-Fi from maybe from a school or wherever they have their Wi-Fi set up at but also get better uh cell signal from the different carriers that I have SIM cards at so right now I'm set up to where I have a Verizon sim a T-Mobile SIM and US Cellular Sim still on my Hotspot unit so in an ideal situation I've got four solid internet streams that I'm able to to put in the speed Fusion tunnel uh and give me a bonded signal um and so far it's been been great I haven't uh I haven't had any any problems so far but but the season is still a little young I've got some weeks to go yet so well that that just means we get to schedule follow-up interview from you and see how see how you did from six months from now you know yeah exactly in fact next uh here in two weeks is kind of my I had one broadcast last year that was the worst as far as just dying on me completely and I couldn't get back online at all and I was just sort of sweating in the Press Box trying to find anybody's cell phone that I could get you know you know Jimmy rig a a hot spot off of and none of it worked and it was just kind of a colossal you know stress vest and and uh so I'm going back there to that same Press Box to the same venue here in two weeks um and I'm that sounds like the big test for sure that's great well uh I can't wait to hear how that goes but you know while we have you here I mean where could people go to check out the live streams of some of these Sports maybe we can get you a couple extra followers and streamers hey you know every everybody likes football so you got it yeah so um the the broadcast platform is called Trojan country where theth South T County Trojans and so we're on YouTube We're on Facebook live at just STC Trojan country um okay try uh try our best to um to kind of bring a a community focused broadcast um getting players and coaches involved kind of trying to go a little above and beyond just um game time um coverage and and doing our best to sort of build community uh in the way that we can you know we don't have a um a radio station that's local our newspaper is much diminished from where it was uh in recent years and so the media coverage landscape in our area is just very minimal because we're we're far enough away from any of the cities that The you know the the larger you know newspapers or TV stations and such they don't come out and cover cover us and so if if I'm not out there broadcasting games interviewing players doing that sort of coverage then it just doesn't happen for our for our community and that's it's just not not an acceptable thing for me uh you know I I feel like our our kids and our uh Community deserves something like that so I'm doing my best to try and provide that well that is awesome and and we're we're a big fan to that concept of of Grassroots and and small towns and and doing everything he can to to to let fans be able to follow their teams I mean not everybody can just drive across the state you know every time they want to go watch a football game so ABS absolutely we we hear most frequently from older family members that um aren't able to travel grandparents and and different community members maybe that even don't have kids in school or grandkids in school and they want to still feel like they can be a part of things they're the ones that have been the most outspoken so far to kind of let us know that they're watching and that they're they appreciate you know what what we're able to do I think we had our homecoming parade uh in our downtown area here a week and a half ago and uh it was uh our highest view count broadcast that we've that we've had since we started doing video and just being able to kind of put put a camera um right you know in the middle of the parade and and uh kind of talk people through it um I think was a a helpful thing um it was fun to do for me too so yeah I think at this point you're GNA just start your own uh television company I mean this is great you know that that's the beauty I think of of YouTube and everything that's out there now yeah is so much of what's really great about media is you can do you can do a lot of this stuff yourself whereas you know even five years ago maybe you could do a radio broadcast and a live stream that way but to really upam to stream video is is a pretty cool technology trick so so that's great to hear yeah the landscape is certainly flattened in that regard the barrier to entry on these things is is way lower than it used to be and it invites a lot of creativity and and kind of problem solving I think to try and figure out well how can we do this in a way that's sustainable in a way that is you know beneficial to the viewers and not just uh I think last year that's part of the part of the thing that I try and improve on you know from season to season is looking back at the broadcast trying to see okay well how how are we looking I think last year I I looked at our football broadcast and our camera was I had a smaller camera it was too far away and you couldn't really make out the numbers or any of the players and so upgraded to a a larger little larger camera with an optical zoom and that allowed you know just trying to trying to make the the the the end product um as good as it can be within the confines of me just being a single person trying to make make all this happen it's a part-time thing for me too I I work full-time um in an office job and so I'm kind of doing these things on the edges as well but um it's been a super rewarding thing and yes you're you're literally the the the play byplay guy the director the producer the cameraman or multiple cameramen you know and are are you live switching between different cameras or you using m year I have one camera right now I had multiple cameras last year and would do a little bit of switching and I'm not quite sure when I get to winter season it might change a little bit but right now I I've got a PTZ camera that uh I think most normally gets used in corporate conferences Church type settings where it can be mounted and then remote controlled different places I also don't have a remote control operator and so I Mount the PTZ I it has some presets so when I get there I can sort of point the camera different places and figure out okay if I want a 50 yard line shot it's going to look here if I'm going to catch the Red Zone to the left of me it's going to be here and so I can preset some of those to go different places but most often when I'm moving with game action I'm just manually panning with a with with my one hand and then it's not too bad don't have too many Graphics going on I've got a little bit but nothing too crazy just kind of a sponsor slideshow and and I have a second camera that catches the live scoreboard so I just do picture and picture with that and put that in the corner I was I didn't have that last football season so I was doing some manual scoreboard entering and that got a little little hairy so it's a little better this year I've got some some color announcers that work with me too so they give me some kind of breathing room a little bit when I need to attend to the network or the computer but honestly this year I haven't had to think about the internet once that since since I hit live and start broadcasting I haven't I haven't had to click over to the peplink dashboard and maybe think about what's going on it's been pretty Rock Solid U for me and of course that mileage varies a little bit depending on the cell coverage in the different places but so far I've been pretty fortunate I'm not completely out in the middle of nowhere you know we're about we're about an hour from De Mo um in central Iowa so um but so far it's been really reliable and I'm I'm excited to see as I go to more places and do more Sports here at the tail end of this year at this season and then the winter season you know how it kind of holds up in different uh venues as well but so far I had a mobile musthave when I when I went through through the sales process um purchased a kind of a a setup package where where you guys kind of came in and helped me get it configured since that time I haven't really had to go in and Tinker with too much in the peplink dashboard it's been pretty Plug and Play since we since we got it set up and got it configured and that's been just one thing I don't have to worry about as I'm planning so that's been really nice well that's that's great to hear personally selfishly that's great for me to here because I'm the one that designed the setup and training program right but but uh but my I will pass that along to our team for sure we really appreciate those kind words and uh we can't hear we can't wait to hear more from you this is this is terrific thank you for taking the time to to uh to speak with us absolutely anytime anytime appreciate it all right well well uh what was the mascot of the football team again the Trojans the Theo okay Trojans yeah yeah we we'll go go Trojans and we are back although I think we flipped sides but that's all right um than thank you again to Darin uh we really appreciate him taking the time to uh to join us for to be able to record that session and uh if you have if you have a similar use case or even a different use case uh please reach out to us we're problem solvers before anything else so uh we are it people that just like solving problems that's why the whole comp absolutely

{"id": "zSweqG9ydsg", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "gduLqq1fW_EvmqdHDjpoSco_MD0", "transcript": "good afternoon everyone my name is Dave I'm the head of special projects for mobile must have.com and with us today we have the entire Murphy family I think the entire well I guess there's no pets in the in the photo but I'm sure they're close by right they are they're in the other rooms they're less distracting yeah no that's good plan it's good plan so we have Andy and Chris Murphy and then we have kenler Killian and Keegan right y yeah that's right very good I I that's that's a lot of K names which I really appreciate so can you let's let's start by talking a little bit about how well one just give us a little background like how long have you guys been on the road at this point yeah I mean I think so like higher level is we just wanted to talk about kind of traveling with a big family on this live kind of with Mo must have here so Dave brought up to that would be a good idea to kind of just come on as as the group I live with talking about being full-time on the road and what that experience has been so yeah so we left Dallas in 2018 we sold our house um and kind of went full in we left a little bit of stuff in storage like wedding stuff and things that weren't necessarily worth anything to anyone else but kept a little bit um and sold everything else so we don't have anything to really go home to per se um and I've been traveling around since then just kind of going to different places and making different circles we kind of end up end up back in Dallas for some reason with doctors or family or whatever but kind of do like little circles out and kind of come back um at certain times now what made you make that switch from from so this was traditional living this was before mobile must have right cuz this was an 18 and we all kind of started at 19 so that time I had a software job as a product manager that had gone remote in 1718 so I had been remote for almost a year and I remember we were like looking around like why are we sitting in Dallas and we have so many other places we can be and I can be working from anywhere and I'm choosing to live and and we were in an area that just had a ton of traffic it was like underdeveloped so there were just challenges like every day just like doing basic things and we're like why are we here we don't have to live in this ZIP code anymore so that was kind of the beginning and then we decided to buy an RV just to enjoy travel more yeah we I really the whole RV thing in 2017 for us was really just to go on vacations and you know long weekend trips and um kenler was rather little he was still in preschool and Keegan had just started homeschooling um so for other reasons other than going full-time and um yeah so we were like let's just let's just try it we had a couple of friends um that Keegan went to school with that were living in their RV but um raved highly about it so we're like well and Andy's Andy's done it too growing up so we're like well let's let's just give it a try so we purchased our first RV and 2017 and just did quick little trips weekend stuff yeah and we did one big trip for the solar eclipse that was in the summer of Summer of 17 one a lot of people remember um we did an RV trip that was like two-day drive and we were driving home from this amazing trip um and we're like why are we driving home my laptop's in the back and he's homeschooled and and we were going back because kenler had been signed up for preschool and we were like okay we do not need to be heading home for this we already have everything we need on us um kind of where the idea of like let's let's just do this for a while yeah yeah and just test it out I mean so I mean we didn't buy the RV initially to go full-time we just did it for those weekend trips and it happened to just kind of fall into our laps evolve into it yeah very cool I mean so so I I can I can completely respect that feeling because every time that I've ever sailed anywhere long distance when you get used to being like on the road and sort of In Motion the first reaction is to just keep going and guys actually did that which is incredible so so yeah I mean we started out when we first went full-time we were like let's just give it six months and we'll either we should know pretty quickly um whether we like it or we don't we also knew there would be challenges in the beginning so by really fully committing and saying we're not having this conversation for six months forc us to kind of go through some of the lower like oh my God we are crazy I can't believe we did this too exping them the high too of like look at all the cool places we've been yeah so then in six months we were like okay are we buying another house or are we continuing um so then was yeah it just allowed us to revisit in a certain point but like now are are you still on the six month like every six months you decide whether you're going to keep going or not or no but we revisit like lately over the last couple of years we've been revisiting on our what we call a nomad adversary and that happens in May of every year so we kind of do a reassessment in May and make sure everybody's doing okay that we're all kind of on the same page or maybe we're not on the same page and we have those open conversations and we like to keep the kids involved in that um CH yeah and keep their you know opinions are value to us so um we revisit that every May over the last couple of years and just to make sure that this is something we want to do or maybe it's not maybe things maybe things need to take a turn and maybe the kids want to do something else and well and it was like over the pandemic it was definitely not getting a house that like pandemic life was not good in the house we were able to travel to Maine and stay on the beaches and you know still be safe but you know be able to have I would say a much better experience I think most people had in you know City safe quarantine so it was easy to renew you know for those two years or so um and then we just went through a big decision did we want to continue or not and we looked at houses and and we were in Dallas at the time we're like yeah this is just this is not where we want to be spending our money yeah I could I could I can I can empathize with that yeah what what are some of the big what are some of the unex expected challenges that you thought you guys that that you run into that you that you ran into that you didn't even think you would run into that's a good question that's a really good question unforeseen challenges um I think there's the foreseen ones that actually are less of an issue like getting mail has been pretty easy um having stuff shipped to us from Amazon like campgrounds get all of that so youfor though I think one that we can put in there is kind of doing the maintenance not not routine maintenance um for the RV but when we've had some um bigger things that need to be dealt with like from a dealer or from um a service shop navigating how to get that done when you live in your RV um you know and and your RV has to go into the shop so you have to you know remove yourself from the RV and when you have pets and small kids like that can be really challenging um especially when you're in you're trying to figure out when your RV can actually go in for service and managing all of that hotel stays or airbnbs and that that has been a challenge um it's not impossible we've done it um it takes a lot of coordinating it does there'ss are designed for you to sit there drop it off and they'll get to when they get to it you know so for it to be Dro off and worked on that day um you just have to be very transparent and there are mobile texts that can come out to the RV we've had those as well but for those bigger issues that the mobile TCH can't do um then that's where those logistical you know unforeseen opportunities that you're like oh my gosh how do we do this in such a quick and timely manner so Andy can keep working and we can keep doing school if we need to and you know managing all of that um I'd say that that's one of the biggest unforeseen challenges that you just don't think about um until you're actually in it and doing it that's also impossible to plan for in most cases because like we had a suspension go out and it was just like okay this is what we're doing today now yeah yeah this this is what this week has now become is because and that makes sense I mean you know you think about it your your house and your vehicle are now essentially the same thing yeah you have all of the challenges of maintaining a home but all challenges of maintaining a large vehicle at the same time I mean right yeah it's very similar to a boat in that aspect I mean it's 60 feet and it's going through a lot of different storms and weather and and types of travel so yeah so you've got to take care of it as and a ton of road miles yeah yeah yeah how how how far like at this point how many laps around the country do you guys think you've made oh my gosh we've done a full circle at least once the East the West Coast was over 20 so that was hard with California and letting people in so when we were over there uh we've done the East Coast now three times yeah Midwest two or three times we usually do them in segments we've done half of Florida because we keep getting rushed out of from hurricanes um or or or yeah events that come up yeah done the Southwest a couple times so yeah just kind of weather we haven't done Canada as much as we wanted to because I was all over 21 and 20 when we had that schedule and the Border was closed but um so yeah definitely more to do there's always more to see yeah for sure I mean I where where um where's next for I know you're in the Northeast right now just because I can tell it's just as dark there as it is here um yeah we're in Connecticut now um next is going to be oh baby's got the camera um next is going we're actually moving not earthquake folks we're moving to like the southeast for the winter probably going to be around um like somewhere in Tennessee is kind of what we're thinking can't touch it can't touch it you want come sit nope I'm sitting all right it's fine too yeah so probably like Tennessee for the winter we've been debating a lot on the Tampa like um RV Show Which is popular for a lot of people if they're looking for RVs um but yeah I don't know and really we're debating what to do next summer that's kind of like that's the big thing you gotta plan the Summers ahead that's what books up really quickly and yeah um takes the most amount of planning uh we should we should talk about uh what what's it like to to I mean it sounds like you guys were homeschooling before uh moving to the RV so I I guess that transition was a little bit easier but what what's what's that like I mean you you you're now in charge of homework and and everything else so yeah so um when you know it's been funny it's been funny sorry the baby um it's okay it's has been an involvement so you know with the kids being on the road for so long we really went from elementary ages and now we have teenagers so um it does have its challenges but we we homeschool of a state that um is relatively easy we don't have State Testing or anything like that where some states do um and I I know for some full-time families that we know they you know are home based out of states that they have to go back and do State Testing every year um fortunately we don't um being out of Texas we don't have that but you know it's it's fun because we can really base our schooling off of where we're where we're going um and when we are in those places they are interactive it is immersive and the kids latch on and they they hold on to that um for for a while and so it's been fun as we Circle back through places where they're like I remember talking about this or I remember learning about this or when we came back through we hadn't talked about this yet but now being back through again this you know now I can see what we learned about you know that tide pulling experience or um those rock formations like we we really try to tie in school as much as possible to where we are so it makes it relevant for the kids and it gets them excited too um and that has been I I think when we do it that way it really gets them involved a lot of people call it Road schooling because you're able to school by going places and by traveling and so it's not really a traditional home school it's it's schooling based on location and what's available and learning not just the math and the social studies and that stuff but you get to learn about the regions you're in right the nature of it the history of the area and then you get to experience it firsthand in a lot of cases yeah I mean it's it's I I remember as as a kid growing up in New England I mean it was pretty easy to study the Revolutionary War because yeah it was all here right you know whereas if if that's abstract concept that's somewhere else it's a very different experience to learning anything yeah see I I I know Andy Andy was in Boston last week um did you guys get a chance to check out any of the the re the Boston Tea Party museum museum that was um it was a lot of fun and then we all sat there and tasted the tea that was on the boats that they I mean not the exact tea but the type of tea that then they were you know throwing overboard and it was you know they talked about the treason they might have been you know doing and the secrecy they all had to you know go amongst themselves and say so yeah that's the whole history side that we get to just experience and oops um you know doing it from learning that from Dallas where we both went to school was just it was just this far away place where something happened on a boat and you know not being landlocked people that was just it's just a story to us it just brings it to life so seeing it is definitely something else yeah even for us we learn a lot too we learn a lot I I think I I think travel in general is so important to giving perspective to to not not just education but life in general and and yeah seeing that there are there's more than one way to to live and and be around other people and and I think it it gives you a much more open mind towards how different perspect like how different groups sort of figure out where they are is he uh is he rewiring the RV now is he reprogramming now there's an Alexa back there so he's sitting there and who knows what's GNA be turning on we've entered this high pitch squeaky phase and that's been only over the last week so that's been super fun but I have I two nephews and one niece and what's amazing is even month seeing them a couple months apart at a time how much they evolve and change it's really funny so fast yeah and I think he's playing it up for the camera too so camera so uh if of of all the places you've been and and maybe this is a question for uh Kean and kenler but what um what have what have they really enjoyed and have they have they conone off and disappeared and moved on to other stuff lost their interest but I I'd say well we always Circle back to as the national parks we do yeah um we are we I had been to a lot before this family was created um but Christen when we left was like I don't understand why the national parks are so important it's true she's like I just don't get it I don't get it and because there weren't any in Texas I mean there's some historical sites there's one really there's one that's 10 hours from where we live so you know there's no national parks in Texas so it's like well what's the big deal and I I will say the national parks are always what if we do a couple over the year those are the memories we talk about those are the the weekends we remember are the hikes that are the the Highlight we've been to 60s something National Park Service places so that could be historical Parks or um monuments or something yeah we've been to how many actual national parks 30 30 30 out of the 63 national parks so wow we're getting closer and those are and we've done some a couple times yeah we have we cired back to a few and just all of them are always just amazing to see and different from deserts to trees to Oceans to mountaintops yeah it's just they're always incredible now what um what what's I gotta ask what's your what's what's your favorite one we don't we won't do the the the match game thing where you both put up separate answers to see we often go back and forth with this question because it's a pretty common question and it's hard to pick just one um and actually the kids tried to quiz us the other day where they're like so if you had to pick your top three which ones would it be I think Andy and I both have different answers so Andy you should go what's your um I have to say the one that was just most mind-blowing to me was the Redwoods um northern California it's just those trees just put you in a different perspective of scale they're like hundreds of feet tall huge bases you just feel like what an ant feels like I think in real life um now I we've been to Yellowstone and arcade we've been to all of them and they're amazing um but yeah I think that that one to me was just like I cannot believe I'm standing here in this for you feel like you were back in like um dinosaur times with all the ferns and huge trees it it was just just transports you it really does it's it's a it's a different place yours so mine is still on the same Coast um but further north and that's Olympic National Park and Olympic I think is really great because it offers just you have everything great biodiversity and you have the mountains but you have the ocean and you've got the trees and the hikes and there's a rainforest there there is the rainforest there and I mean just that Park alone is such a unique experience in and of itself as they all are but that one I think just offers the biodiversity that not all of the parks can offer so that's a good point yeah that one is a good one yeah I really like that one so so getting to a little more serious topic what what what are the community unication challenges like how do you guys manage I mean I I I live in a city with lots of people around but I can still sort of get away from everyone and go hide when I need to um how do how do you how do you manage that dayto day as far as just yeah it was something very important I outlined in 18 of like okay I'm working a normal like remote computer job so I'm doing even back then Microsoft teams slack all the main communication channels and still on calls still on a lot of calls um you know and it was it was 18 so it was more or less modern times like we're used to LTE was pretty popular in you know normal in cars at that point and most cars have turned off 3G and got LT so so that was there but um the technology was not there like you really only had your phone that connected pretty well and I remember doing a lot of research and actually coming across Eric's video when before mobile must have was a thing um so I had gone that route for connectivity so for us what I our goal was one I needed to stay connected two we have kids even back then you had a nine and a three-year-old that were used to streaming the other day kenzer we got a new TV kenzer didn't even know what the channel up and channel down button was for because they stream everything you know I mean like so that's the world they're in right so they're not used to like TV with channels they just what is a channel they go to Netflix and turn on the show they want that was that hurt that comment hurt a lot um but you know so that's the connectivity it was like it was YouTube TV um you know and so that all had to work across um yeah everyone's devices and everything yeah but but to come back to the communication thing as far as the family is concerned that was part of that six-month trial are we all going to work together in a small space oh okay yeah and um at the time we were in a 32t class SE that had no doors so you couldn't just get away you know so you're like the best door that you had was a pocket door and we all know pocket doors just aren't they're just not doors it's not the same thing um you know so with Andy working you know we did have to say Okay kids this is what we're doing and sometimes that meant that we were outside and playing because when they were so little play is still very much a part part of their learning yeah you know so doing that and getting them outside too especially being in a small space you're like let's go outside still find something outside was also always different it was always different I mean every week is somewhere new so that's an easier it's it's a very easy the drawing those boundaries and really setting those those expectations with no the within the family was really a big part of when we started um and that has evolved as we've moved into this RV the first thing and he's like I need a I need a room with a door and so we have the toy hauler the toy hauler has a great door so he takes all of his calls back there he can close the door it gets pretty quiet and so that that works now no pocket doors um but we try to keep pretty open communication you know so things aren't working we try to communicate it any relationship about good communication really yeah it really is and I know not everybody gets along with their family I I've heard that from a lot of our our friends that are like I don't know how you do it because I couldn't I couldn't be in that close of proximity with my family that often so um but I think over time we also just accepted the lifestyle and the kids have grown into the lifestyle um you know and I think that that does play a difference versus being maybe forced into the lifestyle maybe for work reasons or other reasons um yeah being it being a choice is different than it being told against yeah I was going to say so so when you were first deciding to go on the road they were part of your they had a vote in that decision-making process too then well I mean less than they were like five Keegan had somewhat of a vote um you know and we kept we kept that communication very open this is what our plan is um what do you think about this and I remember having that conversation with Keegan and him being like well my friend that's what their family did and we're like yeah and he was like is it because of them I was like no it just it just happened that we you know with all this stuff but so we do try to keep that open and we're very we try to be we try to keep them involved you know so as much as we want their opinion sometimes it's hard to get that and you know we do make decisions that we need to make it's not always based on what they think but they do get a vote you know here and there for for many things do they do they get a vote as to what what destination is next or is that sort of yeah they kind of do and and they also get a vote like especially in places that we go back to um they they often will be like can we go do this again or um I heard that this oh I read Keegan's big thing is I read about this place when we're in the area can we go yeah um you know so we try to make sure that those those things are penciled in and we will have a bigger conversation about where we're going over the next like 12 months and then I'll figure out kind of more the specific route and then they figure out the activities in that place yeah oh wow that's great have they what what's what's an example of like a a hidden something they've found that you didn't even maybe not weren't even aware of when you headed to an area oh my gosh I think um I when we were in Flagstaff I would not have looked this up but when we were in Flagstaff Arizona it sounds like it's part of the desert but it's actually high up on the mountains so your elevation is you're very high elevation it's snowing it's very cold um back when the Grand Canyon was being discovered and highly touristed there was a scientist that came out I think his name was L right and he created an observatory that's out there um and it was one of the first big observatories it's actually where they mapped out um the moon for all the Apollo missions so they have massive telescopes that you can still you that are still being used today they still have astronomers on working Observatory yes so we got to so we yeah and they also discovered Pluto at that particular Observatory so I would not have looked this up had I not had the kids saying I want to like look up space stuff but we went and it was absolutely one of the coolest places we've come across so our our kids are big into space Keegan's he's he's very big into space like so much that that's what he wants to do as a career and then I noticed the Artemus shirt yeah and then kenler is big into dinosaurs and paleontology so in those places another place would be um Casper Wyoming which is there's not a lot happening in Casper but there is this really awesome Museum that they have on the I think it's the college campus there think so and there they have the first I think it was the first Triceratops that was discovered um there the skull of the Triceratops and they had a huge Mammoth that was discovered um so and they had this really awesome museum curator who took the kids like we didn't we were listening but the kids just soaked in um that just raed and and the the tour that they got was so elaborate and exactly what they needed and kenler was just like I want to come work here when I grow up so as as the dinosaur kid that he is you know so it was really big big woolly mammoth that found very nearby and Stu so like those places those are the kinds of things that the kids tend to to be like oh can we go to can we go here this looks really interesting so um fun opportunities we uh we hitting up the Goldfish there is that what that is we are attempting to keep his mouth busy it's too good I I I we're not sponsored by goldfish but we'd be happily sponsored by pe thank you very much they're they're great comedy but uh um not a sponsor not NAD but you know still um the the snack food of all snack foods right especially when you're you know under the age of five yeah no perfect perfect um so so uh with homeschool I just want to go back to homeschooling a little bit do you is there with even with the the state not having sort of testing is there guidelin do they give you guidelines or or certain things that you have to check off as far as Milestones or how does that work so each state is different each state is very different very different um and there are with all things yeah just scholing and there's an organization out there called hsld da um that is very well known across many of the full-time families um and they do a lot of The Homeschool laws so um if but when anybody is starting to think about homeschooling and traveling um that's kind of the the place to go for making sure that you are on track and doing exactly what you need to be doing because some states you've got to let them know that you know you're you're homeschooling some you have to establish yourself as a private school some um do have subject requirements um most have subject requirements it depends on how many and um um and what they are um you know so you can make sure that you're you're homeschooling like that and that what you're teaching is very much you know in line with those requirements um and then some have State Testing and some don't so um it's just really important to know where you are based out of like what you call home where your car is registered where you are registered to vote that's typically your domicile and so your home school is based on your domicile State um and making sure that you are well aware of the parameters um and how long you can typically stay in a state before you have to start um looking at that State's hom school yeah hom School laws um so there's a lot that goes into it but that the hslda organization they are great at outlining everything you need to know for that um and making sure that you don't fall into the cracks or um get yourself in a hairy situation yeah yeah that's and then as as the kid so your oldest has got to be getting sort of close to looking at colleges and stuff right yeah he just started freshman year this year so we we are um of high school and so yeah we're definitely talking colleges universities if that's something he wants to do we are very much in the belief that he can go and do whatever he wants so um if he wants to take a gap year he certainly can um if he wants to go right into college or university he can do that too um but kind of making sure that he knows what his options are which is kind of overwhelming when you know you're a freshman in high school so um but that has been a big conversation for us this year as far as holing is I mean just from a homeschooling standpoint seeing a huge turn last five five years in what colleges are looking for and how they're they're actually looking more for homeschooled like students because they're not just taught for a test you know they're taught you know they typically show big independent thinking and different exterior curricular activities than you know what a standard student would have um you know so some aren't even looking at standardized tests um to get in necessarily they'll either be doing knowledge based tests or you know standard stuff like that or an interview or interviews yeah yeah yep well and and and I think at the end of the day the the standardized test model was was one that I think everyone figed out not the great perspective that it might have been right especially when the school sort of I I don't want to get too too crazy into that world but you know I totally I'm just laughing does he is he taking apart the Goldfish box at this point or his whole hand can fit inside the ginormous size one so if it's if it's not managed it will all be on the floor yep yep no I I respect that for sure do you guys have the whole home vacuum system that just can suck up the whole it's very important I would imagine we also have a vacuum mop that helps with all of the other messes yeah yeah the good news is you also have a house that has a hose attached to the outside of it so you dirty you just take them outside really the dog does most the work I mean if we're honest here just let the dog and she does most the clean up it's excellent excellent so so how many so you have the three kids the two of you and then a dog and a cat or okay we're in a 45 foot toy hauler so it's quite a bit of square feet compared to most um I think we're at about 350 square feet when I measured it with slides and stuff it gets weird but um yeah so we have a standard like where the normal someone's used to a fifth wheel they've got the bedroom up over where the truck part is we've actually converted that to the bunk house then we're in the main living space here and then in the garage where my office is we talked about earlier and we've actually made our bedroom so um that way we have a bigger space than the dark kind of closet up there the kids are in so so the bunk house meaning all the kids sort of live up in in the in the front of the yeah I mean Killian's still in the back with us so the up there but yeah Killian's in transition so he's now 18 months so he's he's starting to work his way up with the big kid up to the big kid room which is I think ultimately where he really wants to be he doesn't want to be with Mom and Dad he wants to be with the brother um so we're starting I mean like he's he's in there more than he has done so you have so many you have so many out already let's eat let's eat all of these but the ones in the Box taste better sure do I love it absolutely too funny that well um I do uh trying to think where where um with with the kids and and being such different age groups too is it is it hard to to manage sort of the lesson plans and teaching that way too or so um how I tackle it personally what works best for our family because of the age group differences we have some subjects like language arts and math and and sometimes foreign language um that are really more individual learning um and then we have other subjects like the sciences and social studies and history his yeah all of that um that we do more is family learning um and we we I can scale up or scale down accordingly and that seems to work really well for us I know that doesn't work for everybody but for for us it does um considering the age group now with Keegan being in high school that has thrown a little bit of a wrench in our gears for that kind of style of learning but um he has really always been an independent learner by Nature um and does a lot of it's more of an unschooling approach for what Keegan does because he can take a a a subject like his latest thing is chemistry and just dives into the chemistry or dives into to physics or dives into whatever that is um so I have touch points with him for things like that um so it's we resets every year some things work and some things don't so keeping it keeping it good for both the the high schooler and the elementary I mean they are so different but yet there are some subjects where you know they we can combine them and and it it makes sense for everybody to learn kind of on the same level yep yeah do you do the chemistry lab outside so that the RV doesn't get blown up or yes AB but it's it's interesting things like uh we sell water softwares I'm not trying to plug anything here but there's the whole recharge process of like you and so instead of that just being some weird thing dad bought for the house we talk about why salt is what you use to recharge what the chemistry is behind that and then we get to learn how water softeners work that you know I didn't know honestly until we were looking it up just you know with him um you know when he's like oh well the saltman and does this and then you know it's got different ions and he's actually probably more in the know about this stuff than I am now um um but we get to you know like so that's just how we do a lot of things it's just how what are we doing what are we learning what are we a lot of it comes from just living and and learning you know from living so why do we need to know this stuff why does anybody need to know this and or like our our battery in the car or the truck um was giving us a hard time and so Keegan was out there helping Andy you know with the jumper cables and and making sure that it was on the right side and like learning all those those skills you know those things that you don't necessarily learn in school those are also what we're focused on and then learn that the batter is filled with lead and um sulfuric acid I think and so that's why they're so heavy because they're literally heavier than water those elements you know learning all of that and he's like yeah it's a heavy battery oh man just to move those things around my shoulders start hurting thinking about it you know yeah yeah I mean I I think that kind of practical education is so important though too in in the sense that they're going to walk into the world with a real Real World experience the question is I guess are when they when they go to college are they gonna move are you going to get them a van to live on campus they go to college they'll probably be more comfortable than that although dorm life is kind of what they are used to now so it's true yeah they're actually probably better prepared for that than most yeah yeah but yeah it's a mix for like the socialization sign is you know sending them to Summer Camps where they get to kind of toe step into life without Mom and Dad um being there and then that is the challenge too is just having not us do everything for them so you know having programs with remote teachers when possible or spending weeks with grandparents or friends um so they just they get other experiences that's that's that's phenomenal um I I I always the the the the subjects that made the most sense to me were the ones that I got to interact with and and I think when when you got to I think it was really high school when you started to do labs and and stuff like that especially with the Sciences I mean the difference of of seeing it practical like watching my teacher Mr Knight take a cube of sodium and throw it into a bucket of water and blow up the ceiling tiles in our in our chemistry lab class was a visable experience as to what a chemical reaction was a lot better than just reading about it in a book right yeah I uh are there Scorch marks on the outside of the the the RV at this point from all from the C no not yet think there's any holes that are disintegrated from other things though I think there is but not that I can remember off the top of my head but but I mean I I I can imagine that you've you've had the chance have you been have you had a chance to go like watch a rocket launch or anything like that as an example or um we were trying to do the rocket launch specifically we've done the solar eclipse we've chased those a little bit um we've done Disney in the winter time because you can just not take off work or not take off school and go to Disney you know because you're right there and you can take your house with you um we've done we do a lot of museums too um not necessarily like Children's Museums anymore because um the kids are so much older but like the science museums and the tech museums Smithsonian museums when we're in DC I mean there's just there's a lot of learning opportunities especially as we travel um those are typically the first things that we look for outside of the parks um are museums and I mean the national parks we've done like Lincoln's Birthplace um to I don't know what are some of the other random ones well yeah and we went up to like aadia and they had not in the park but like in Bar Harbor they had part of one of the colleges up there the Rangers did like a whole tight pooling um like demonstration and so it was like a mini version of what you would find out in the real tide pools which then we did later but it was like a whole educational thing of like here's the different creatures that you can find and here's why they behave the way they do when the tide goes out and versus When the tide is in and you know so there's that kind of um that kind of science that kind of natural history that they learn too um and that kind of stuff is all over you know so um even at the observatory that Andy was talking about earlier in Flagstaff they do those science demonstrations like what you were talking about the explosives and um talking about you know um when Rockets go into space this is the combustion that happens in a smaller scale version but here's what happens um you know so there's a lot of that too that that is out there that we consider part of school you know it's not here in the rvar so well what a great way to keep them engaged in in in all of the subjects I mean I I I go back to that same concept of practical knowledge over everything you know I think that makes all the difference in the world um yeah what uh what's what's what's been a CH what's been a subject that's been really difficult to to to teach besides anyone that they're not interested in but you know right I mean the upper versions of math I would put on my like I I just can't help you anymore the the trigonometry and the calculus and the all of that um we Outsource the the tutoring on that so it's pass to the because they come up with like I can't figure out this problem and you're like okay I got this like it's third grade math like I'm good but then once they get to like ninth and 10th grade advanced level math you're like look I barely passed this the first time please don't bring it back up yeah so so that so but that's an interesting topic in and of itself like how do you Outsource a a lesson like that so there are programs um that you can do there are there's a thing called um out school that you can sign the kids up for online classes that are with teachers um that do exactly that focused learning um you know so if if he needs an extra hand in trigonometry we're certainly help you know that's certainly a place to go um we have sourced people within the family that you know have have done that really well who are engineers and and all that kind of stuff in within the family that were like can we just borrow your time for just an evening like we just have some questions um and they're always happy to help so um where we get most of it I would say it's just family extensions of like oh this Uncle is good at math or you know this best friend that we actually went to school with or whatever yeah those those are the best resources we have and then and then sort of the last topic I mean let's let's go back all the way to the beginning how did you guys meet slow um High School really go back that far yeah wow we met freshman year and we started dating sophomore year and yeah the rest is history yeah literally literally 2004 2005 yeah I think this year we'll be celebrating our 12 years of marriage and 19 years together yeah something crazy okay something crazy like that yeah just doing the math of when you guys were in high school and think about how old I was but I'm not gonna go [Laughter] there um well I I do anybody have any questions Dave do any questions come in or ask questions I can ask I don't care about what it is no I mean h we we've had a pretty steady group of of of of people watching a small group of people watching so we are I'm going to take a second here and reward them with our our special deal of the week that's right um it'll only be up for the next 24 hours we uh we have some mobile must have beanie beanies that have these amazing little LED lights on them as as like headlamps and so you if you use oh do you have you actually have one don't you got one I gave mine away last year as see we find so yeah but uh we if you use the code mmh special at checkout for the next 24 hours you will get a free beanie as long as with any purchase uh as long as supplies last which I'm gonna guess we we've got a few of them yeah I think we have a 100 of them or so yeah so I don't know if they can be found but I'll show it if it if it comes up yeah they are they're great they they come with one sort of uh coin battery I think they're called the little like uh jewelry battle the little and then there's another version they have another one that you can swap in that is USB rechargeable I think we swapped all of them to USB rechargeable ones oh we did yeah M mine came with both lights but that makes more sense to yeah I think we took out all the old ones and just just have the rechargeable ones now um yeah cool yeah anybody had any questions about like if they're going on the road or any challenges or concerns they've got we are happy to answer oh okay we don't have the light but this is what the beanie is oh very yeah you see where the light goes but yeah yeah very very nicely embroidered and actually really practical and warm and great for for being out at night especially especially now in New England where it gets dark at four o'clock in the afternoon yeah yeah and it's free so put it in put coup code in and get a free you want to try it on try on for you oh boy here here comes the cute here comes the thumbnail a too funny I love it well since since we don't have any questions I'm I I I think we can close it out by just saying thank you so much for for uh having us in in your your home and and sharing your kids and and your experience with us we really appreciate that thank you for having us yeah what what yeah love it and and I hope this I hope the 3D printed uh coasters come out well we'll we'll give we'll give him a plug I was G to give him a plug too I'll post a story on uh Instagram when they come out so people can perfect the next generation of a Mobile retailer right that's right very fun well thank you all thank you both so much and and uh really lovely to to get to talk to you Chris I talk to Andy all the time so thanks d thanks for sharing your experience we really appreciate it and Lynn I agree thanks for sharing your family so we one comment from someone who is watching so app thanks then yeah well have a wonderful evening and uh exactly that's that's a good that's a good qu right there so all right thanks everybody and if you guys if you guys want to follow Andy and Chris's Journey uh please go check them out on where wild Wes roam we'll put the link as a pinned comment on on the on the YouTube stream so you guys can go follow their their blog and and follow their travels and I think that'll be a good uh good way to end yeah sure we'd love to have you yeah absolutely very cool well thank you both very much and we'll we'll talk to you soon Andy I'll probably talk to you in about five minutes probably very good", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2023-11-10T10:02:06Z", "channelId": "UCE9KnGK2TcpXLlIi5cQfGvg", "title": "Fulltime Families: Living and working on the Road", "description":

{"id": "WNRK_Xqc1N0", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "-h5UgKVCls8i1EBmy27OIg-rEN8", "transcript": "hey guys this is Andy from mobile mus have I'm excited in this video to walk you through an install we recently did for a good friend of ours Mike wiland from RV lifestyle this is my life uh my bread and butter my life blood the internet and being able to travel and go to places and have reliable Communications you want to plug the wire in [Music] first now this video is actually really exciting and important and something we run into a lot we were reached out to by Mike from RV lifestyle to help him set up a better internet solution for him in his RV and I want to take you through that install to kind of show you what we did give you a different idea of how installs can be done in fifth wheels and just I think showing examples of the stuff is always important and how we solve the problem but one key thing I want to talk really important on early in this video is the importance of highquality Hardware which we know is important and that's why we sell peping it's the best one but really also the importance of the configuration on the firmware side of the hardware too and with Mike this is a great example of someone that had a peplink already um but with the service and the company they had it from it wasn't configured very well so he had a terrible time using it and it wasn't doing anything he needed it to and he was basically completely locked out of that Hardware altogether now the configuration side of this it really takes us to the next level and is something that you can't get out of any other router is a program called speed fusion and what speed Fusion is going to is it is going to combine all of these internet sources together and create a multi-lane kind of Road of traffic that he is going to be able to put all his all of his internet usage through so if you're on a live stream and starlink drops out because you're under a tree like I am here and it's dropping out every N9 minutes the rest of that network is still going to go over cell and then if Starling comes back it'll you won't ever drop out you're not going to drop a phone call you're not going to drop a live stream you are going to stay connected as your entire internet connection is going through multiple sources today we are doing an install with Mike here on the ultimate Road Warrior 5G bundle we're also going to be including a starlink flat Mount install with this we're going to take you along show you the install process now Mike before we kind of get started I wanted to ask you a couple questions about like why did you call us what were the issues you were having and and kind of can you explain to us about like what you were looking for okay first why I called you guys yeah um there are a lot of really I don't want to say fly by light no I will say it Fly by Night people out there and um I know you guys aren't uh I know some of the people that you have worked with uh they have highly recommended you and uh plus I've met you around at at uh various functions in the RV industry yeah and the reason I called uh after I decided I needed to talk to you guys is um this is my life uh my bread and butter my life flood the internet and being able to travel and go to places and have reliable Communications and although I have been able to do so it has been a challenge I have to have um I have a a router I have an internet plan I have a Verizon myi internet plan I have a backup myi with an internet plan uh and so many different connections and uh I have starlink and I would put starlink up every time i' I'd come in I'd put it up and put the dishy up and that'd be a tree or I had to somehow get it up in a windstorm with the telescoping anten and it was just a pain it was a pain and um two or three times when I'm doing a live stream it would just die the cell connection would die starlink would the weather would change starlink would go and as I said it's my bread and butter so I need the best system I can get and that's why I called you guys well let's get you going let's set you up and uh we'll do some test at the end I'm ready right now this is not going to be a step-by-step install video but I I did want to give an idea of how we did the install things we considered like placement uh so when we first got to mic it was pretty easy um to find a place to install it he has a back entertainment system on it from that we know there's AC and DC power that's how you run your TV that's how you run your radio so it was pretty apparent quickly that that was going to be the best place for us to install the overall unit and we even confirmed that by pulling out his radio there was 12vt power right there so it's really easy to grab that power put the peplink kind of really next to that and would be a great place to do that right above that there was no AC units or any issues there so we just were able to put the antenna right on the roof right above that uh first thing we do with all our installs is we always kind of focus on the outside first whether it's because of the weather and it's warmer unlike today um it's just really easy to do so we installed the box that we're going to do all of our cable work through first we did that on the ground this is where you can really see iotech coming into play um where we're putting in an 111 antenna with starlinks we have 12 cables coming down from the roof into the RV and then from there uh once the box is ready we go up on the roof we can drill a hole we put in a 2 in PVC pipe where basically it's going to be a cable drop system and then from there we put a box on top of that this creates a really really tight water solution that is not going to have any water coming in even if water does get into the box you now have basically an inch of water that can be sitting inside the Box before it's going to come in the RV so multiple layers of kind of protection there of course with dcor all over it so it's really creating a simple solution there now with the antenna um the antenna we just kind of placed a magnet Mount based antenna on a galvanized steel plate right next to the box so it was far enough away from the AC unit it was well placed if it ever needs to be changed out in the future it's just stuck with a magnet down um we can easily remove that and change out for any future antenna that you might want Even though this is a dual rated 5G antenna that is not going to happen anytime soon once the box is put in place we have die all around it we can start fishing the cables through the icot tech system you can see that here it just looks so nice and clean and we know it's every grommet is designed specifically for that type of cable and that like the cable thickness uh we have full bundles of these on our site if you're looking for something like that so make sure to check out our site depending on what type of antenna you've got we've got bundles for that you can always reach out to our support staff if you've got questions but the iotech solution is really solid here um and created a perfect solution for Mike we also brought the starlink over so we installed the starlink antenna at this point too we moved that up further on the roof just due to placement we wanted a flat surface for the Starling to be mounted so that it had the proper runoff for snow melt or anything else that might be collecting on that antenna and then we had a long enough cable so make sure you measure that cable too to do a drop down into the cabinet below so that is a thicker cable again we have a grommet specifically for the uh starlink high performance dish on our site too um and all of that goes down inside now once you're inside it's pretty straightforward we're mounting the peplink we're going to make sure the power supply for the starlink is in the right spot and we're connecting everything together really the install while though it might be a little timeconsuming to make sure everything looks good and it's perfectly clean it's really not that complicated overall now this is where the key thing comes in from configuration we have all this Hardware set up we've got everything set up and you could put in a SIM card you could fire up and be on 5G and you would be good to go but there's more to it than that we can create more stability we can create more channels we can create more to this so it is a better more robust solution as you're traveling around and this is really where the solutions that mobile must have come into play some of the services we offer can be huge um and definitely worth considering uh now to wrap this all back into Mike this made a huge difference for him in his overall live streams he hasn't had any single dropouts since we've been talking to him for about a month post the installation here um he's had a really great time and a great experience overall using this between starlink and it goes through basically Bally little bit of trees like this with that high performance one um but it's overall had a great great experience now with speed Fusion they know that their their networks aren't being dropped as as starlink might be jumping between different sidelights as they jump overhead and going seamlessly in between cellier and satellite he doesn't even have to do anything to set that up this is the same system Eric and I have been using for years in RVs making sure they work and this is the same stuff we travel with every day um as we continue to travel around the country exploring the great place and the whole reason rout here in the first place is to kind of explore but still be able to work and be connected as as we do so like modern humans of the time now if you guys have any questions about any of the products you've seen or setup guides or anything like that you can't find feel free to leave a comment below you can also chat with a live human on our website during the day um at mobus have.com on the bottom right side of the screen you'll see a chat icon you can also shoot us an in an email at info@ mobus have.com and we'll get back to you as soon as we can too uh we're here to help you guys stay connected and with any issues you might have uh all right guys thank you so much hope to see you on the [Music] road", "snippet": {"publishedAt":

{"id": "Z6fMoS-PYBE", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "UcGvocDkceSdgmqppGabOi4Uv9s", "transcript": "it's cold check that out that's the look of frost that we just had our first Frost up here in the Northeast and that's normally time for me to hight tail it out of here but we've got some family commitments that are going to keep us in the Northeast through the new year so I've got some winterization tasks that I need to take care of and it got me thinking that we haven't told you guys how we use our viair air compressor systems to winterize these RVs which saves us time money and keeps a lot of that nasty tasting antifreeze out of our lines now we also spoke to Vier and I've got some really cool deals basically access to the best deals of the Year through the early Black Friday sales event so come along I'll show you some winterization tips and get you some good [Music] deals all right so let's start with the discounts now V has authorized me through manufacturer rebates to give an additional 15% off the already bottom line price prices that you see at mobilus have.com and better yet if you're a member that's going to stack with your member discount so that could be like 25% off that's crazy for these systems that just never go on sale it's Black Friday they're authorizing it but I got to say take advantage because it's going to be wall supplies last these are going to move they're very popular discounts are right there below in terms of how you can get access to that offer and if you're watching this video after November and you missed the sale make sure you check out membership mobilus have.com that gets you 10% off sitewide it's a great membership it supports our community it gets you access to the mobile internet Resource Center all sorts of great perks two-day shipping blah blah blah tons of stuff so check it out okay so now before we get into winterization I want to give you kind of a highlevel overview now everything you see on this table I actually travel with regardless of what rig I'm in and it looks like a lot of stuff but because of these Ultra portable little cases that they have that fit all of the accessories I don't even really notice it they the kind of one of the best things about VY is how compact the stuff is besides just how absolutely great it works now any system you're looking at if you click on the video tab on the listing page it will have a detailed description of that particular product I'm going to keep it high level focus on of the winterization but at the end of this video I will kind of give a high level of like the small medium and large and what they fit well for in terms of use cases just so that you kind of get the cliff notes now since traveling on the road since 2015 I found having these two compressors for me is like the ideal pairing and I'll kind of get into it but let me tell you a little bit about kind of what I travel with now if we're doing long haul kind of gone for six month trips we're typically in the big Class A Diesel Pusher it's a big girl she's about 50,000 lb and it's got a lot of tires tag axles in the back and the tires range anywhere from about 85 to about 115 120 PSI in the front so I need a lot of pressure and a lot of air volume to keep these tires happy over here I've got a 13,000 lb or so all aluminum ATC toy hauler that we use for trade shows and short trips we tow this with a 2500 series diesel pickup truck it's a bumper pull not a fifth wheel it's about 35 ft long and it doesn't have a lot of needs from a tire pressure perspective we'll go into more detail later in the video but just covering some of the high levels of my setup I've got a 450 series for the Big Bus what I love about this is look at that massive 50ft long cable it means it doesn't matter where your batteries are when you're hooking up the pump you can get to all of your tires I love that it includes this knee saver cable it allows me to just screw on the connection to the tires and then stand up and fill my tire and not worry about having to press of you know a wand down and hold it to maintain a perfect connection it's just my favorite thing about it it comes with all those adapters for filling balls and bicycles and everything else you can think of and that trigger handle is just such high quality I can not only add air but I can with the side button remove air if I overfill it just lets you dial it in perfectly for those folks that have dual tires this wand is key for getting access if you've got those inner valve stems that you've got to get to and you need the ability to fill on both sides comes with that the duty cycle on the 450 is infinite it basically means it'll just run for ever and provide air so you could fill up tires from dead flat it's just an amazing pump why do I carry this little guy well honestly because it's a little guy it's so small look at this little tiny case it comes in it's like 8 or 9 in long it literally is I think 9 in it's so tiny it comes with this 25 30ft hose you can check the listing for the exact length but it's just so portable so easy to use and absolutely great it goes up to1 PSI so when I'm looking at you know the 2500 truck or topping off these tires I got to go from you know 65 to 75 PSI it's like a minute it's quick and it's fast and it's portable what I like about that is I leave it in the truck I'm not usually carrying around this big one I leave that in this RV for the most part and if I ever get stuck on the side of the road something happens I got a flat whatever I've got a pump with me that doesn't take up any space in my truck before we go on into winterization just a work heard about Tire safety I know you've heard it all before but after sitting down and speaking to Tire experts folks that have actually manufactured tires and listen to what they have to say tire inflation is so crazy important to your safety it's not even funny not to mention your wallet if you have a tag axle vehicle like this and you're underinflated by just 5 six PSI you're effectively dragging that tag axle rear wheel behind the wheel right in front of it it's destroying the tires it's not good for the the axles and it's dangerous if you've ever seen a tire blow out it's it's bad on the front tires an underinflated front tire could lead you to quite possibly the worst rving situation that I don't want to go into but you do want to take tire inflation very very serious not to mention properly inflated tires cost you less money you get better gas mileage all right I'll stop talking about tires let's talk about winterization so via came up with this and it's not rocket science but it's really wellmade and it integrates so well into their kits and this is a air valve system that they call their RV winterization kit what it's effectively doing is it's taking a compressor that has the ability like this to go up to 150 psi and it's adding in a a gauge here so you can see how much pressure and a valve here so you can control it as well as these quick connects so that you can connect it all up to your existing system so that you can use it to blow air through all of your water lines to get that water out to properly winterize the system they include this handy garden hose to air adapter as well so you screw this on as I'll show you right now into your water inlets and then you can connect up the entire system here to the compressor and then regulate up the proper amount of air pressure that you're going to be running through the system you typically don't want to run more than 40 PSI through a water system to protect your pipes and ensure you don't cause any damage to any copper pipes or any PEX pipes now you always want to refer to your RV manufacturers instructions cuz a lot of them are different and they do other stuff with plumbing but I'm just going to keep it really simple on this ATC travel trailer which I think is plumbed like a lot of these travel trailers out there it's pretty simple but before I do that you want to make sure your propane is completely off and your 12vt systems are completely off you don't want that hot water heater attempting to fire on electric or propane when you're winterizing the system and I think it goes without saying to say don't open up your hot water heater if it's hot I think you guys all know that this has been off for 12 hours it's nice and cool while I'm letting my hot water heater drain I'm going to go ahead and get my air compressor system working and now is a good point to mention that you need a 400 or 450 series VI to do winterization it's one of the reasons why they're a bit more expensive because they have the duty cycle and they have the capacity to keep that CFM kind of amount of air pressure consistently going through the pipes to allow you to do an effective winterization before we hook up the air system we do have to deal with the fact that the hot water heater has that gaping hole in it where we took the anoid rod out so you can kind of do one or two things you can put the rod back in and tighten that up and you're good to go for next year obviously inspect it or replace it if you you need to or you can actually put the water heater in bypass mode um which means that you're basically bypassing the water um system from the hot water heater which is typically done behind the system all RVs will have that in the user manual on how to do that next I'm going to take my Vier winterization kit and I'm going to back off this knob nice and far so that I know and that's counterclockwise so I know that I've got the system set to basically provide no air into the system I'm going to go ahead and connect up my compressor to power and I'm going to hook up all my hoses and connect up to my winterization adapter now I've screwed in the garden adapter here and now I'm going to connect up the winterization kit as you can see there and then I'm going to dial in the air pressure to be about 30 to 40 PSI once that's dialed in I'm ready to go ahead and screw on my garden hose adapter to my freshwater Inlet don't do your tank fill Inlet you don't want to just blow air into your tank uh you want to make sure that you're on City not tank fill and you're ready to go before I hook up the compressed air I'm going to go into the RV and into the bathroom and I'm going to turn on my bathroom faucet I'm going to kind of split it between hot and cold here so that I get access to both the hot and cold water lines now I want to open this up before I connect the compressor just to make sure I don't create an over pressurization system as I'm hooking everything up now I'm going to go ahead and hook up the vi winterization system as you can see here depending on if you have a buddy with you a second person you can incorporate the trigger as well if you want to be able to turn on and off the air and have somebody outside monitoring the pressure to make sure you don't have an over pressure situation but I'm typically doing this alone so I don't use this because I don't want to have to hold this trigger down and that's the beauty of these Quick Connect systems is you can incorporate this or leave it out and air will just flow automatically through the system now there's some debate on the internet some people say open up all the faucets let the water drain I personally like to go one faucet at a time and let them drain because I think it really gives the most amount of pressure to that one leg of the system to get the water out but make sure you do all of the water out of the cold and all of the water out of the hot then go to the next room open up that faucet and go back and close the first faucet you don't want to be in a situation where you've closed all the faucets because yes you've got this pressure regulator out there but I just think it's a smart thing to not have a system that's you know completely pressurized with air in the system at any given time so just leave one of your faucets open at all times once I'm done with that first faucet I'm going to move on to the shower here I'm going to go ahead and take the shower head down and put it on the ground so that I don't have water trapped in this hose you see and I'm going to go ahead and turn that one on and then I'm going to go turn off the bath vanity so that I get more pressure going through the shower and on and on and on depending on your floor plan and your configuration to get all of the water out of the various different pipes and systems depending on your floor plan so you're done right that's it well not quite we haven't gotten the water out of the water pump yet and that's something that will definitely break If it freezes full of water so the internet and myself kind of vary on this one now I personally have turned on the water pump left my compressor running and blown air through my water pump and called it a day and it's been fine for a couple years on a couple different RVs it's worked effectively for me but it's really about your rist tolerance and how comfortable you are with possibly having to replace a water pump if you want to be the absolute safest possible follow your RV's uh instructions on how to then add antifreeze to the water system now the good news is you didn't waste all that time time pumping all the air or the water out and pumping all the air in you'll actually use a lot less antifreeze because you got all that water out and it's much less likely to have a freeze event if it gets super super cold because you're not diluting the antifreeze with all that water that was in the system so by cleaning it out you're probably going to save one to two gallons of antifreeze which is nice um but it's really up to you I've done it with just air and it's been fine now we didn't cover this RV in this video but this RV has an Aqua Hot system if you don't know what an Aqua Hot system is don't worry about it it's not important to you everything we just said is fine if you do have an aquahot system there are quite a few differences in how they are winterized now you can still use air and blow out all of your systems and do all of that but there are coils in that Aqua Hot system that are very sensitive and not necessarily replaceable so you could be into the thousands and thousands of dollar situation if you let an Aqua Hot freeze without proper winterization so just make sure you check your user manual on that and follow the guide to make sure you properly winterize that Aqua Hot so pump is done everything's done we're good to go we're all finished right nope one last step those pea traps they call them pea traps cuz they're kind of shaped like peas and they're in the bottom of all of your drains and they prevent odor from coming up into the RV and they are always filled with liquid what prevents the odor from getting up there is a little pocket of water that water can freeze If it freezes it's going to crack your drain pipes so the last step is you want to take some antifreeze and you want to dump it down each of your drains not you don't need a ton of it but just enough to wash out the Peet trap and make sure that it's filled with something that isn't going to freeze also make sure you pour some down your toilet cuz that's going to make sure that your black Tank's not going to freeze and you know for good measure maybe add a gallon to one of the drains because that will protect your gray water tank through the winter and that that's it we did it that's how you winterize the system at least in this ATC trailer and it's pretty common in most fifth wheels and other units but again make sure you check your user manual now I know for me I love using the air method because it keeps that antifreeze out of my freshwater pipes when we first started adding antifreeze to this when we first got it it felt like it was like a month of study water and a weird sweet taste and we're like oh what is this we got to get this out of our systems we had to flush the system and run um a sany cleaner you can't run bleach through a lot of systems Aqua Hots they you can't do any of that so you know we use a Water Sanitation system but it was just a mess once we were able to bypass we have to winterize our Aqua hop but we were able to bypass and just use air to blow out our lines it meant that in the spring we were able to just get up and go and fill our tanks and not have to deal with any of that antifreeze stuff all right so let's go back and talk a little bit about the differences in the pumps because it's confusing for folks and on our website having to jump through all of the different models can be really confusing so I'm going to kind of start with the flagship unit here the 450 and the real claim to fame with this unit is that unlimited duty cycle the fact that it can go to 150 psi and essentially run for an infinite amount of time is why it's more expensive and why it works so much better the second reason for the 450 and the 400 which is very very similar we'll get into the 400 in a second is the fact that it comes with that trigger system and with the knee saer cable and with the big long wand for for filling your tires it also comes with these two 25 hot hoses which can be connected together and that gives you that full 50 plus feet for filling everything the 400 the 450 50 are essentially identical with all of that so for a lot of our customers they go with the 400 because it's cheaper so why is the 450 more it's that infinite duty cycle now the 400 believe it or not actually fills tires faster just by a smidge but it doesn't have the infinite duty cycle so it could technically overheat but the 400 has been a rockar for just about everybody I know 400 or 450 they're very very similar units and they're just absolutely awesome and they include that winterization feature if you add on the winterization kit there's a model right in the middle that's called the 300 and that unit is really it was kind of designed for fif wheels and towables um the the unit has a 30ft integrated Co um hose it can go up to very high pressure that 150 psi as well uh but it has a lower duty cycle rating so it could technically um overheat if you're like filling tires from dead flat we haven't really had any reports of that it's absolutely great and it's a kick butt little pump so it works very very well it has an integrated hose that works a little bit differently though and for anyone with du tires this might be a problem for you because you're not going to be able to get to Inner valves because you're not going to be able to have the the accessory kit that you have in the 400 or 450 but if you're just looking at straight external tires like on a regular car or a regular towable it's going to work great for you it's got an integrated gauge that works extremely well and it's a great middle-of the road system for under 200 bucks and then the 89 like I said earlier we don't have to beat it to death it's just Ultra Ultra Ultra Ultra inexpensive and Ultra Ultra Ultra Ultra portable I love it it's the best little pump I'm honestly a bigger fan of that one than almost any of the other ones but I can't live with it it can't be my only pump but it is just awesome if I've got it in the back of my car it's saving me this is what comes out fills up my tires my ATVs the kids soccer balls everything else just works really well with this I don't have to mess with getting big hoses out or anything like that this is just a much easier play and it's just so inexpensive at that sub $100 price point and that really kind of covers the big differences of the V units so to each his own depending on what you need you're good to go so don't forget about that Black Friday all of basically November I'll put the dates below 15% off deal on the pumps that is absolutely killer and it

{"id": "95GETDzbDQQ", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "Kaz3dNWF34Fkye4VfzDKu6oyHS4", "transcript": "new product alert if you've ever had a peplink device mounted up in a cabinet or somewhere where it's really hard to get to those pesky SIM cards at the back of the router we've got a solution for you come along with us and we'll tell you all about [Music] it so if you have a peplink router you may have noticed that on a lot of the models the SIM cards that you install on these devices typically are located very close to the majority of the antennas based on how they have to design and build the devices so we have reached out to peplink and said hey any chance you could put these on the front with the ethernet cables but there's a density issue because a lot of these devices are small but it is under consideration but I do have a solution for you in the meantime exclusive to mobile must have we've developed this which is a small Sim extender box now there's ribbon cables that come out of the back of the device and there are two ribbon cables for each device now this is manufactured and designed to be used with peplink devices it's not a third party device now if you install you'll see at the end of these ribbon cables there's little SIM cards and we have this box available in both the Nano very small Sims that come on the newer routers 2022 um on and in the full-size Sims uh commonly known as 2ff not fulls size like size of a credit card but we just call them fulls size Sims The 2ff Sims uh as well so you can pick up this box in either variant once you install those ribbon cables just like you do normal SIM cards this box now has SIM card slots on the front of it and it has two slots for you to put in and out sim cards now regardless of the style that you got on this side this side on the box will always be a 2ff fullsize Sim and if you don't have 2ff fullsize Sims on our listing page you can pick up a small adapter to bring your Sims up if necessary but the way that we've designed the boxes this particular side is always a 2ff Sim just because if you're moving them around it's kind of a lot easier to deal with the bigger size Sims now inside this box there are two slots just like on a peplink device and you always point or Orient the metal side towards the other SIM slot with the notch side in it's really identical to the previous generation peplink devices in terms of how you install your Sims and they are spring-loaded as I'll show you right here there's also a hole right here with a status indicator light and when the modem initializes and it initializes either sim a or Sim B A light at the top of this hole or at the bottom of this hole will illuminate to tell you which Sim is active that can be very handy if you're just coming over and you're looking and you don't want to take out a Sim that might be keeping you online so we've got a little status indicator light there as well now these boxes are small um so kind of hard to mount sometimes but you could absolutely use velcro but we have included these branded little anodized aluminum magnet kits inside of each case and as you can see here that is a magnet so this has 3M adhesive tape on the back of it you can put it pretty much just about anywhere that is convenient for you um and boom you can mount it like that and you're done the distance between the Sim extender the back and the front of the router is about 15 15 1 12 in technically um I think they say 15 just to give themselves a little play in the manufacturing process we find it's about 15 and A2 and that gives you plenty of um kind of distance to be able to mount this either underneath or in front or in a different area inside of the cabinet to to to get easier access to those Sims while also being short enough to ensure that the data from the SIM cards can get to the router without too much cable causing a problem where your Sims might may not boot up properly this product is available exclusively at mobilus have.com and you can check the links below four links to uh each of the products remember there are two versions you've got your 2ff fulls sizee SIM card version for older Legacy style peplink routers and then your Nano 4 FF size for the newer Styles both available and shipping now at mobilus have.com as always make sure to check out our memberships at membership.

our founder from mobile mus have today um Welcome to our live stream uh today's topic we're going to be talking about the icot tech fittings and cable management system that we have just launched on our store and uh I know Eric is I know how to bring wires down from the outside to the inside yes exactly foret about the product that's something customers drive themselves crazy about like how do I get wires in without uh having a bunch of leaks and I would say probably you know consistently one of the biggest stress points that we've seen from the very beginning of working together here at mobile mus have in the sense that there I don't think it it's been a concern of anybody that's bought it an RV or anything where you need to drill from the outside to the inside so I'm glad we're solving the problem yeah I mean it makes uh it I mean look how many people drw holes on the roof of their house probably not that many it's sort of a specialty um and you know you get into these RVs and there's like a bunch of wallpaper and cardboard and insulation and you sort of know that if you introduce water into them there's there could be Pro problems ahead they're not they're not great with water yeah yeah water finds a way to get pretty much anywhere uh i' I I spent enough time offshore on sailboats and worn some of the best foul weather GE you could imagine from all of the carriers the uh manufacturers you'd imagine you still get wet at the end of the day water finds a way yeah and uh unfortunately RVs are they kind of need to be light it's sort of what helps them go down the road and meet their weight requirements and if you add uh water to them they are not light anymore um our our buddy Andy from our team recently experienced that because nothing to do with anything that we sell but he actually had a delamination issue on one of his RVs that meant that there was like a wall separation and like water got like got into the frame of the vehicle that was under warranty and they covered it but yeah it you know you're driving along and then all of a sudden you're 7,000 lbs heav than you think you are it's not good yeah water's heavy anyone who's ever had to carry a five a five gallon jug or a 10 gallon jug of water it's it gets heavy quick yeah absolutely so for me it was a scary thing you know I I uh in 2015 I bit the bullet to hit the road and like a crazy person went straight for a 45 foot RV that was pretty pricey and and uh you know just said I'm going to go hit the road and one of the first things I did was pay a installer um to install a satellite dish and a roof antenna so that I could get some uh mobile internet back in 2015 and uh I kind of was impressed with the way they did the wiring like inside to get inside the slides and to kind of make it what I requested I never really went up on the roof for probably like three months well I mean it's pretty high up there and you know yeah I'm afraid of heights I I'm pretty sure you are too probably probably less so these days but since you've done time this was a well-known installer who had install the roof antenna uh who who did all the installs for um I know he no longer works there so I don't I'm not gonna mention his name but for um for um for motor home specialists in in Texas a really big uh RV Outfitter you know kind of their claim to fame is the largest RV dealership in the world and uh I trusted their guy is that the dealer where they give you a golf cart to drive around in because the parking lot so big yeah you get a golf cart at set of keys and come back by five o'clock and good luck and don't get lost and that's sort of their that's their pitch probably they probably gotten a little bit more uh Hands-On but they're they're a good place if you want to see as many choices as possible not an intimate sales experience do they do they at least have a GPS like on the golf cart so they can come find you if you're not by five o' probably I spent so much time there we did a video for them on our blog at Livin light.net and uh and it generated a bunch of sales for them and we love them down there they've been great so we we came back and bought another RV in 2021 which is our current RV so we we're but you know it's just a different approach it's it's big inventory and you know no pushy sales people yeah good go do your thing so anyway um that installer that's no longer there anymore uh ran a a wire down from the roof and when I went up there and looked at it um basically he drilled a hole down which went into a cabinet below in the RV uh he screwed the cable down against this the roof and then he just poured dor all over it dor is this self-leveling um sealant which I can grab in a minute we sell it uh it's an amazing product it's like a think of it like a silicone or a caul that never really hardens and levels and flattens itself to a flat level surface so self-leveling dor is designed to be used on a roof and one of its benefits is that it sort of self-heals and adapts and does well and very extreme temperature changes so to that installers credit it never leaked but I just was kind of dumbfounded by this drill a hole down pour some goop on it buy that was the strategy so from that moment on I was like first off there has to be a better way like what if I had two cables or three cables or four cables like because a bundle of cables is definitely not going to waterproof because there's space in between them yeah and I am a techie guy who's changing stuff all the time and I don't want to go up there with a spatula or I mean technically it's a putty knife and like get rid of this disgusting stuff which anyone who's ever worked with diore if you step in it it's like just throw out those shoes like the only thing that gets rid of it is mineral spirits or like paint thinner and it's just a hostile product like any newb who's ever worked with it gets it on something and and then you learn never forever their work shirt yeah yes just don't just don't even it's gone so um so I've been look I was looking for years for better product that's really you know what it what it came down to so uh big reveal do we have some iOS iot Tech stuff we can we can show yeah absolutely so um you know webcams are a little weird I'll I'll make you the uh I'll make you the the feature presenter here let's see if that works oops I'm the feature presenter let's go way there we go so so what iotech essentially did this company in Germany giving you some backstory iotech is a company that makes cable entry Solutions um for uh like big manufacturing you know like you go into like you know an automotive manufacturing plant and you're G to find aotech products all over the place because most of the products or the machines or the automation tools or the CNC or the wet saws or whatever are custom built so a lot of the wiring and the cables it's not mass-produced stuff so eot Tech sort of cut their teeth in a very high-end engineering uh industry that had very high and strict tolerances for ensuring that you know things were waterproof IP rated for dust entry water entry all these things um and I stumbled up PR their products in 2016 2017 but I quickly kind of figured out that unless you were you know a giant Manufacturing Company who had like a sales rep coming to your big Factory every weekend it was get it was pretty hard to get these things um so I figured out a because we own businesses we've got an electrical wholesale account and found a wholesaler and picked up some parts and started testing the stuff um and I've been kind of Easter egg featuring it in videos for years now um it's the main way that I enter all cables into all the installs I do uh because it's modular and because it's uh very future proof so to kind kind of give you the big reveal of what iotech looks like this is an iotech product that I've kind of put together as a sample and every iotech product comes with a frame or a housing so we'll start there and then there are grommets or small inserts that go into each of the slots inside of those housings and each grommet is defined by the size wire that you're going to put through it and then the density of wires so you can have up to four wires in any kind of standard grommet that we typically sell um okay these These are called KT series grommets for for geeks that care and I've actually um this one's featuring a different style grommet but it doesn't really matter the only difference is the grommets are a little thicker that we sell at mmh than what you see here because this is a demo and that additional thickness that you see there gives you just a little extra added water protection that we we like to to to use the the KT series Grom work work uh work really well so the the the claim to fame here is see how they're split right there so what that means is that you don't have to have the ends missing off the cables when you do an install like this so you can take a roof a roof antenna you know or something and go ahead and insert it while it's got the ter the nice end on the end of it and not mess with trying to figure out how to do cable terminations solar just about anything and then once you have the wires through the grommet you simply take that and then you insert it here's a three slot housing once the wires are through it you just insert that in boom it goes right in and then you've got a locking cap that screws tight and locks everything to be watertight now I was going to say and it looks it looks like it compresses it a little bit there so that so it helps it seal off that's pretty interesting exactly now these frames come in rectangle one slot two slot three slot really up to five slot we can get them in 10 plus slots so if customers like I really want to go bananas we have all that stuff it's not yet on our store yet we went up to five slot with our initial launch because that's 20 cables that's more than enough for the average person um but for for you Eric's out there we can get you up to if you do it 10 slot I guess that'd be 40 cables you can obviously do something crazy like this which is build a box and then have multiple you have multiple products on that box to go as crazy as you want to is is is that gonna go like on the the next Tesla space shuttle or something that's this is a trade show box because I it's so hard to explain to people I'm like I'm just going to put every option in a box and lug it around with me one box to rule the world yeah so there's so these housings come in uh so rectangle right round this is a round one with a four slot round is very nice because it's a standard hole saw opening so for the four slot for examp that's a 2 and a half inch hole that you would drill inside of um a a mounting box that you would use to to usually install one of these or right angle this is a right angle so as you can see there there's four slots there but then the cables actually drop down through here okay so that gives you a little bit of added flexibility for so so for someone who didn't want to install a box like a roof box like this this is just an empty box that you can pick up you know we can send links um this is just an Amazon box that we've used quite a bit of made out of um ABS is a good material for if you're looking at boxes because it's just it's highly UV resistant and does well with temperature changes it's kind of well known in the automotive industry um but um with something like this you could technically um I'd recommend grabbing I didn't put one right here but like a ground plane that we sell like an 8 inch ground plane you can actually drill a hole in one of our little 8 inch ground planes and screw this to the ground plane and it comes with a nice gasket seal here that will seal it all down so if you were going to um use nuts and bolts to kind of secure this up to the ground plane and then you could just secure the entire ground plane down to the roof and that would be a way you could install it without a roof box um the 90 degrees what I like about 90 is if you see here that's an example of what it would look like on a roof it's just mounted flat down so that's an option but then if you look here these are what it would look like if you mounted it on the side of a box with the cables coming out the bottom yeah so there then there's almost no chance for water to find its way back in at that point yeah I mean these These are these are technically rated ip54 which um I think is vastly underrated for what they actually are um they perform much more like IP67 uh meaning like almost submersible uh but okay like I said iot Tech's highly conservative it's like German company you know they they're just really kind of over over promising an underd deliver you know overd deliver under promise kind of thing and um now you know I'm going to ask what does IP rating mean because uh we could send a chart but there's I think it's Ingress Protection but yes and there's two numbers the first and the second that have to do with different types of Ingress protections one is kind of like your material and on your your I'll send you a chart it's kind of you know there's two numbers the five yeah we'll post it as a pined comment afterwards on the on the YouTube channel for sure yeah but for those who are like oh ip54 is not enough if you were installing on a box you could use a 90 degree and face down and the housings themselves are the uh 68 so very very high ratings um but the ramets if you go into multiple cable density like this that's where you get to 54 if you're really like I just need to have 60 something which I've tested it doesn't really matter but if you did if you go with a single whole grommet these are ip68 as well okay so you know but the housings all get you covered to to essentially you know I don't want to use the word waterproof because it's dangerous but I've had these out there for a very long time and they don't really have much of any issues yeah I was going to say for you for for all intents and purposes you've this isn't a product that we just found and you picked off the shelf this is something you've actually tested for years at this point yeah I mean that's this stuff stuff like this like so when let's say it's you're in a freezing situation and then the product fails because it's not designed to be in that type of environment or you ultraviolet light you know and you just have problems with it over time now I'm not going to say these grommets are bulletproof um you know they do have chemical resistant properties and quite a few things to make them um work very well I've never replaced a ground but um and 's miles and miles of spec sheets on on these they're used in the food service industry you can get special blue ones that are food grade a million different things but um but uh yeah three plus years I've had them on multiple installs we just did an install for Mike lman from RV lifestyle.com uh featuring these and um there's some pictures of that if you hop over to mobus have.com and right on the homepage you'll see an EOTech you can click on that it'll bring you to a Lander that not only lets you see what packages there are but also some photos and how the installs work we kind of put together like a step-by-step guide for how it all works got it got it okay so I guess the next question would be for for a lot of our customers what would be a a recommended sort of go-to because it seems like there's there's this is one of those situations where there's a lot of variables in terms of the types of sort of grommets you could use the types of boxes you could use the types of installs you could use sort of infinitely flexible which gets us to that place of what you know what would you use in in your situation I and and I can respect the fact that the answer is going to be it depends but well it's a good point I mean I think one of the the only thing ipotch does badly is they have about 40,000 SKS and for you to figure out what you need is practically rocket science um like I spent over a year just being like how does this all work and not that it needed to take a year but you know we were dealing directly with the manufacturer and didn't necessarily have a sales rep and we set ourselves up as a direct North American distributor so we can really help other dealers and other folks do this effectively as it grows so it took longer but for the average customer to keep it simple we put together bundles that are most popular uh products and we categorize them based on what our customers are using them for so most of our customers will have a five in one roof antenna which is usually like single Cat 4 sing like like our essential or full timer bundle they'll have a seven inone antenna that would be for our Road Warriors and our speed demons that's if you have single 5G or uh dual 4G and then for our ultimate Road Warrior dual 5G customers on the br2 you have an 11 in one antenna on the roof so if you hop over to that homepage and you click on the cable management um which is right on the homepage but it's also under on the the main internet uh navigation it's right there it'll say cable Cable Management Solutions or cable entry Solutions um you'll see those bundles broken out that way and then in there you can pick the housing that you like and uh and then it's going to know based on what ant you know what setup you have what grommets to put in for you automatically and we base all of our bundles on a four system so this is a good example this is um this would be an 11 in one antenna so you get four cellular another four cellular two Wi-Fi your GPS yep and a blank so the blank is there for if you want to add a web boost booster if you want to add starlink there's a couple different things that you can do with that and there is an option where you can replace the blank or add to the blank um for for different uh things okay okay so in other words you could you could buy and like let's say you just had a a single LTE Mo the single 4G Modem with only two cables plus the GPS plus maybe the Wi-Fi you could you could expand you could set it up in such a way that you could expand over time yeah absolutely and and if you had a box like for instance this is a small box it's a uh I'm a geek and I got measuring things everywhere it's about 7 by 6 by4 a nice little waterproof box you know you could have one on one side and then you could put something else on on the other side this one this one wouldn't be the one that I would do I would do a um I'll show you the one that that is very popular it's all grab right here unless they take my last for anybody that thought Eric set was virtual that's a pretty good example of why it's not um that's his actual Workshop it's very much uh yes so it's a production facility so this 4x4 is really popular because it lets you put it on a small side face and this is one of the options in the bundle it's a great great little split split house could you fit two of those on the on the long side of that thing too yeah you absolutely could in a 7even inch box it's very very tight density so you can put two on uh one of these boxes yeah the company that makes this on Amazon is actually called mackerel like the fish so but if you just type in waterproof uh junction box there's hundreds of them um we just mackerel seems to be a a pretty decent uh quality box or this box which is um made by kantex is a this is massive this is a 12 by 12 by 6 inch box they sell these at Home Depot um and you can pick that up in 4x4 smaller sizes Home Depot's got a pretty decent assortment they're just that's like a $65 box because but is that is that where SOI sleeps on pretty much I could totally turn this into a cap box but um that's a good point so why do we ever even feature a box this massive so if you're in a if you're in a class A that has like Gerard awnings and rails on the side of it um this will actually allow you to put your roof antenna on top of the box and um and then you can go down or out the side with iotech depending on your install ation use case and that'll keep your cellular antenna up above your roof rails for better performance so for me I have a box just like this my antenna is mounted on the top of the box without an icot Tech it just goes straight into the box on the lid and then the icot goes out the side and then another iot is on the front cap of my RV so there's rails on the side but there's also a lip on the very front of the RV and I go into the front cap on the horizontal side of the front cap after I start describing this I should have thought of bringing up a picture but I'm sure I'll I can grab it um that allows me to then go drop in this is an Integra coach um like a an any yeah pretty much all of the Integra Coach diesel pushers now have a front cap that's lifted above the roof so there's this space on the front that you can basically drill a hole in put an icot and then fish wires directly down into the cabinets right above your driver's seat it's a really easy way to get wires works with numar a couple others as well well and anyone anyone that's ever had a roof rack on any of their cars that didn't have a fairing or something to help with the wind noise I mean if he didn't have that cap on the front I would imagine it driving down the road would be pretty noisy yeah all the insulation maybe not but you know the older style caps just met right flat to the roof the new ones go up above and essentially it's what it's trying to do is it's trying to hide the ability for you to see the air conditioners and stuff and just makes it look sleeker and then it also um it also has an awning integration into the side so your your awnings are are built into those rails so it's it's a sleeker look on a higher end bus but it means that if you mount anything to the roof you're kind of inside this little metal cage dip that can impact your performance um we've had plenty of customers just install antennas in there and they're fine but if you want to be super highend go you know put it on a box yep okay okay well I'm gonna let me give you just the the this is like the number one question is what is the most popular sizes for what perfect right that's great so if you have a roof antenna for us from US parac Mobile Mark uh pointing um peplink any of those antennas the cellular and the wifi antennas which are the bulk of the antennas are five millimeters so if you're looking at any of our grommets and you want to do a special build and you don't want to buy a bundle five millimeters so depending on how many cables you have you want a 5 millimeter cable for that um the starlink fixed Mount High per performance hope I don't screw this up uh starlink fixed Mount High Performance that we sell that is a big fat seven uh cat 7 cable that is 8 millimeters in diameter so you get the 8 millimeter if you've got the starlink dish the standard starlink Rome cable 7 millimeters uh the we boost boosters which use coax cable 7 millimeters and uh anything I forgot to mention email us and I'll probably know what it is because um I live with digital calipers all the time and test out everything and measure it and sort of know what uh what size most of the stuff out there is we've tested it all oh um solar 10 gauge standard solar wire which is like the standard wire that you see in almost any solar 7 millimeters got it okay so you know so if you're you know you can get a a multi insert here with 7 millimeter it's going to look more like this and then your solar can pop in and you can incorporate that with the Internet or do it separate depending on how big your solar install is if you're doing over 50 volts on your solar put it in a separate housing so it doesn't mess with your cell signal that was going to be my next question is is there any concern there with electrical interference but minor the the uh the cable that we use the the LMR like 240 that's um or or 200 205 depends on which antenna but it's got a lot of shielding in it so it's pretty decent um but if your voltage get I mean I've seen solar installs where the voltage is like 250 volts and I'm like there's a lot going on in that that level of voltage where you may want to and just move it off to the side to something else give it a little separation and you know make it a little easier yeah I can see that but like for me the fact that you can just swap these grommets Out means that I've done one box installer one one kind of cable entry install on most of my RVs and then as I swap stuff out I improve it I change it I upgrade it none of that stuff changes I just unscrew the top of these housings change out the grommet to make it whatever I need and I'm Back Off to the Races and the housing is usually are good for life so I'm really just changing out the grommets to whatever I need um and for me this probably won't apply to most people but for me I love that they also sell these that's a little blank insert oh okay so it's like if you wanted to get higher cable density because you're just like I don't know I might add a second cell antenna later um you can pick up the little blank inserts and fill up whatever holes you're not using um and you know like if you only use two for Wi-Fi and you had two blanks there for something later you can just plug them and those are on our screen too it's just sort of a you know they kind of thought of everything so sort of to go without saying there you wouldn't want to necessarily drive down the road with one of those like let's say that let's say that four box of or four uh through through thing of cable with only three of them populated you would that sort of is inviting water to come in a little bit easier than you can see through it it's probably not going to be waterproof yeah yeah no it works but then not only do they sell the plugs like this you don't have to go get a grommet they sell the blanks so you could just get a blank as well and yeah swap them out and most folks that kind of play around with this stuff and are tinkering end up with a little basket of grommets that you can use to sort of swap out out and swap in as your projects kind of evolve and you figure out what works best for you well I I don't want you get mad at me boss but I I we did secure a special deal for anybody that's actually watching this live stream for the next 24 hours I managed to get us get get everybody 20% off iotech products with a special code and I'm going to put the comment he's not kidding I didn't know about that I saw that going through while I was prepping for the uh for the live stream I was like oh all right cool that is one of the benefits of us uh you know they they were gracious enough to uh co-sponsor that with us to to give us some some uh some benefits for customers I had I had another Banner saved here but hold hold on one sec I will put it up as an actual Banner as well on the on the scroll me one second um what else do we uh what what I mean I mean I know you're really excited about this product for sure so here so here's something I've never talked about with EOTech but we do sell um I kind of didn't want to overwhelm people with too much stuffff but I'll show you what it is let me see if I can grab a cable all right so here's a cable just an ethernet cable and iotech sells housings for interior Mount applications as well so as you can see there there's a round a round unit and it's got uh brushes there that kind of just hide the cable so if you're putting one cable through two cables three cables whatever you've got a really nice finished goodlooking um hole there that you can manage and these are split frames meaning that if you technically have wires going through something already you could put the housing around around it and then slide it in oh wow okay so you wouldn't have to un you wouldn't have to disconnect everything not necessarily now you do have to kind of the hole would have to be a standard size hole um but um what I like about their products with these um interior mounts try to grab one to explain it but they have like a flexible ring around them to ensure that they kind of hold themselves in you can sort of see here see these like these Springs yep so you know if the hole is a little too big or a little too small I found that these are very forgiving and just snap themselves in without you having to use the locking ring which is a nice touch because sometimes sometimes you can't get to the other side of the cabinet easily or it's inside of a double walled cabinet and you just need it to hold itself in this is the smaller size but then um this one's so small I'm not sure how easy it'll be but you can see they they just come apart so you could technically go right around the cabl it's just a nice nice touch you know I was always using those Home Depot uh desk grommets that you'd like Drop in to cover wires and yeah they were ones yeah but like you you do a two-inch hole and they don't really fit in the two-inch hole they're a little too loose they fall out so then I'm like taping electrical tape around them to get them to be a little thicker before I shove them in and and it's fine it's just more work and this is just a much nicer looking finish especially if you only one run wire one wire through it or two or three or four it kind of like expands and just looks really nice so the these interior options I think will be really popular for van lifers and folks that are like building their kit um or people who are like doing an interior desk remodel or something you just want stuff to look a little bit nicer with a nicer fit and finish the the interior models are great and these are round or um or they come in rectangle as well so you can kind of decide up to 147 millimeters I've been living in millimeter land for a while I'm not exactly sure how many inches that is four and a half I guess somewhere around there four to five inches something like that so yeah I always remember two and a half centimeters which would be 25 millimeters right 5.7 I wasn't even close yeah I meant to an inch but yeah yeah yeah I you were you were closer than me I think the crazy things we remember yeah so I mean we do have a couple comments here I just want to highlight Jim bti who I totally recognize because he's been through setup and training and I've helped him a bunch uh he love the uh the video on the vi the iite tech product and and Steve sent a smiley face which is nice too yeah so you know uh thank you both for for tuning in and watching I hope you get to to be able to use use the uh the discount the the exclusive little secret discount code we want to we want to leave that as an incentive for people to come and watch this live I know a lot of people come and try and we watch it afterwards in the first 24 hours so the code is good for the next 24 hours it does not stack only because that would require me to hire a programmer to do that part of the discount code thing and we didn't have enough time to pull that off but uh but it is 20% on its own but it's pretty healthy discount on a nice little product so I think that's pretty cool yeah I mean these aren't going to break the bank and they're not going to you know put my kids through college that's not wasn't really the point the point is that you know we have customers that have this problem so regularly where they're just like I need something to get wires in that's going to make sense and it's going to be future proofed and scalable and you know not cause me to have a major problem on my hands yep well and and I think that's a pretty consistent philosophy of anything that we've done I think anything that when we look at new products for mobile mus have.com the first question we ask is is this solving a problem for our customers whether that's the any of the internet stuff we sell with peplink and all of the different antenna options or the cable extensions or the uh tire pressure monitoring systems or water filtration or really anything that we've sold including now selling Starling too I I think all of it was to be to be as convenient as possible and make us a One-Stop shop for people that that live this lifestyle so and I I think this fits exactly with that from that standpoint so get on yeah absolutely that's that's the goal um I did want to share my desktop is a hot mess but let's see can I yeah you should be able to present right uh let's see if I can I can probably just this is probably going to look a little weird because I'll share the entire screen but let's see if it works so I wanted to just give folks the opportunity did that come up yeah there you go Okay cool so people often ask like how this actually comes together you know how do you actually get this thing mounted on a roof and how does it work now my go-to method for doing installations is what you see here so I this is right this has all been prepped and I've built this out and um this is about to be installed and what essentially I'm doing here is I've installed a piece of 2in uh PVC pipe that um I I did a whole core drill you know I start out with a small 38 inch bit now you want to really kind of talk to the RV manufacturer you want to do a site survey you want to do an inspection probably the single biggest thing you want to make sure you're not GNA hit is electrical wires um which is why I use a smaller bit to start so I can look in and I can feel around and make sure I'm not going to hit a wire bundle um and then air conditioning ducts and typically you can kind of just tell based on where your vents are where your ac ducts are going to be and you don't want to drill through an AC duct because then you're going to be blowing cold air into the ceiling essentially and if you did hit something like that you can fix it with um C you know basically duct tape that's what it's for um but there's that's why it's called duct tape duct dctt yeah yeah that makes sense um but you know proper planning is key to making sure you understand where you're going to do a cable entry insert and almost all man RV manufacturers can provide you with schematics of what's going on in your roof where the wires are what's going on um then through walking on the roof you can tell where your frame rails are or basically your studs that are going across to hold the whole roof together they you while you're walking you can sort of tell it oh it's hard here it's soft here and they're typically 16 to 20 inches on Center depending on the manufacturer so um you know don't drill into a aluminum stud or that will be really hard to get all the way through and you will be messing with structural Integrity but assuming you know where you're drilling we install a two-inch piece of pipe that goes in to the cab and I secure my 2-in pipes with just a little bit of hot glue so they don't drop through uh the ceiling and then we install uh dor around the base of it like that as well as putting a good amount of dor on the bottom of the box as you can see there and this is really really what the finished product starts to look like once uh you've screwed the box down to the roof let me see if I've got there's a there's an up kind of photo view of what our installations typically look like this is Mike's uh installation on his brand new uh Montana so what you end up with here is a box that you can open that has a permanent entry point for wires for the future and if you notice the the pipe is about an it's hard to tell here but it's about an inch up from the roof line um and because there's Dior all around the bottom of the the box it's completely water sealed so if for some reason water did get into the box either from the box seal or from the iotech it's going to collect around the box and the lip of that pipe is going to keep the water you know you'd have to have an inch of water in this thing to have it start dropping in um I've never personally seen that happen as long as folks you know follow the instructions and tighten everything down but this is an installation method that just gives you something that's highly future proof easy to access and avoids that sort of shove the wires down the hole and then put the box down and all the diec cor kind of hits the wires and it just turns into this big hot goopy mess this is a much cleaner simpler way to do an install that uh that can get you really really good results that's a great look and is that the are you basically standing on the front edge of the RV there this is actually the firstmost back Edge if you look up at the RV directly next to him at the top of this photo that's basically in the same orientation got it okay got it now his particular floor plan has this massive Media Center cabinet um at the back which was why we mounted this so far back um not it's common in fifth wheels to see that a bit more than um than others so there's a string the core um there's this you know building out the eotac there's us doing the uh install now when I cut out for square frames I use a flush cut tool or you know you know basically often time they're called a multi-tool um they basically just vibrate and they allow you to to do some pretty Precision nice work um but if you don't have one of those a standard drill and round uh is a really great option as well okay okay or if you had a really Steady Hand a Dremel tool or not so much or I'm just kidding but uh dremels I've used plenty of times the problem I have with dremels is they're gonna melt the plastic so as you're kind of rling through it's basically melting and then almost rehardening behind you uh definitely my go-to tool and choice prior to the flush cut generation coming out in I don't know it's probably been 20 years now it's kind of sad but the multi-tool um that kind of changed the game for the ability to just fastly cut holes that are pretty precise uh in you know ABS boxes that's a cool it's a cool use of I mean you use it to cut you can cut pretty much anything with that thing don't don't they use that for cutting um like electrical box boxes and stuff like that and houses too I mean cting drywall and yeah we do a lot of drywall cutting my dad and I with those um they don't really like metal that's where they start to kind of struggle a little bit they're they're really good wood tool drywall is basically like I don't know it's basically like dust so it's it's really mean on blades you can cut through it fast but man it'll dull a blade quick uh but it absolutely we cut tons of drywall with flush cuts and um and it's all dependent on the blade you have so you know but for cutting plastic a standard wood blade goes goes through it like butter and it's uh a great way to to to make a fun little project nice we do have a question from Norris here he says um what I I think what he's trying to ask is what's like what what cable SI or what uh entry size would you use for like a standard TV cable coax so uh yeah and he said sat TV so most most satellite units are going to use RG6 cable it's pretty common um which is uh going to be a 7 millimeter Grom it's 7.12 or something like that but it works perfectly with a 7 mm G um if it's an older cheaper style of cable TV wire that is like pre-installed in your RV a lot of times the inner wires are what's called RG58 um then you're going to drop down to use a six millim but most is seven and I mean the grommets are not expensive so you know you pick up a six and a seven and check your application that'd be what I recommend but if you know the type of cable those are the two most common for for TV applications and those will be the size you want got it okay very good and I think that that's just another little point I want to highlight there I think you sort of did it automatically but if you're between sizes you sort of want to air to have the the opening be a little bit smaller than the cable so it sort of compresses around it yeah so because they're soft let me see we got a few minutes right yeah absolutely yeah we have a few minutes let me grab a antenna from our friends at mobile Mark I talked about mobile Mark in a while so grab one of their want to make you thank you back featured presenter here for a bit while you're doing this yeah so this would be a good example see if I can get an A A gromet that is what you're talking about so this is g to be so we'll look at this GPS cable so this is a three millimeter cable uh I'm sorry this is two this is a 2.3 or 2.4 millimet cable it's like right in between so if I put a three on it we're going to split this open pop our cable right through the middle it's it's on there yeah but what I don't like is this yeah it's it's yeah there's not much grabbing on to it and if I give it a squeeze it's just yeah that's worrisome right so I feel like that's gonna become a meme by the way whatever you were just doing whatever I just did yeah probably right everybody likes uh I gotta get some glasses Dave this is I'm getting old like two MIM I'm wearing them welcome to the club man it's it's not it it was it was a very brutal moment when I realized I needed glasses yeah oh I've known I just got to go get the uh the appointment going so then let's [Music] do a 2 millimet so we're going to go down one really put the two here two this is our backup inventory I just keep for our installs now a two looks almost identical it's like kind of the same exact thing but if you look closely in inside there you'll notice that the there's a small bit of of um I don't know the word I want to say it's flanged but I don't think that's the right word but they coping or something like that but it's it's curved in towards the hole yeah and that yeah that allows the uh The Grommet to be somewhat flexible based on the size of the wire when you get into some of these smaller applications you have a little bit more Flex so when I close the two over the 2.3 I get a nice tight fit there you go not I'm not seeing anything I don't see any light coming through there you know obviously there is if I leave it uncompressed but when you go ahead and screw the thing down you get a nice it seals itself yep right and the housing is really designed to to hold all four sides of this and just tighten it right up and give you a nice tight fitting perfect perfect yeah you you don't want you don't want the wire sliding in there now I I had wi sliding in one for the better part of eight months because I just was lazy and didn't order the right ones and I didn't get any water in it's like water is not it it's unless it's like coming at you sideways on the roof like uh which wouldn't happen if you were driving fast um you know and you had it facing the front and you had it face forward um but uh but yeah you know when we're talking to customers I like this kind of error on the side of worst case scenario you know some folks do some crazy stuff you Alaska TR Trippers um but uh but absolutely it's it's been a product that um I think just solves a really really cool um problem that we've all had for a really long time which is how do we get a lot of cables in from the roof and do it in a way that's modular repeatable and uh scalable you know something that we can just update over time and not feel like we have to do it over again and you know we've had people what you know if I'm going to sell my RV you I don't want to put all this stuff in I want to take it when I leave IO te's the perfect thing to think about when you do that so you want to take your roof antenna with you that box I just showed you you that's a selling point for the buyer you say I've got this box up here anything you want to add you want to add solar you want to add this you want to this here's your main entry point it's completely modular and then you load up the icot tech with four blanks you take all of your expensive Gear with you and you sell the RV and you know you go off and you buy one more AquaTech house they're not that expensive and you can repeat it on your next RV and it's instead of you know the goopy pre-installed roof Anna that you know someone's trying to yep yep yeah or or the person that buys the buys the antenna glues everything permanently to the RV and then tries to take it with you and leaves a crater on the roof which with some D TPO rubber roof like if you adhesive something down to that when you try try to take it off it's going to rip the roof off with it so yes you can roll a new roof with you know you literally just roll rubber on um but it's you know there's easier ways in my opinion yeah know I could see that I could see that very cool stuff uh it doesn't seem like this is a topic that's going to have a ton of questions because I think it's pretty self-explanatory but Norris's comment about my glasses making me fall over laughing I just read that smaller print lower the floor yeah absolutely totally agree with that I experiencing that not happy about it most of the time my inventory team could not have made that print any smaller it's like a 0. one F I mean it's even that camera can't see it yeah but the bags are small so I guess they needed to use tiny label and your iPhone camera can read the QR code so that's all that matters exactly I'm like when in out magnify out wow yeah this is payback for all those months of making fun of my dad huh he's he's got the little l laugh now of course of course well cool well um thank you uh thank you for the demo I think that's ve a very cool product I know you're really excited about it and I could see why it's it's a it's exactly what we needed to solve that kind of problem for our customers so I think it's gonna be good we are excited and if anyone has any questions as always you can uh reach out to us at info@ mobile mav.com or um start up a you can schedule a a chat in the bottom right hand corner you don't have to schedule at all or you can schedule a consultation at talk. mobilus have.com which is uh where we're always available okay and last lastly just to highlight it once again because I got away with setting it up icot tech 20 to save 20% off All iite Tech products for the next 24 hours and uh other than that we will say thank you so much and uh we will see you next week when we're gonna interview Andy I think to to uh get a get a feel for what it's like to live on the road with your family yeah hopefully he's bringing them that should be a little bit of a he doesn't know we're gonna do that but I'm gonna you know pitch it to him tomorrow when we have lunch so yeah so three three kids dog cat husband wife I think is the that's the roll out it's it's they got they got a it's a full house should make a TV show The Wild Bunch or where the wild where the where are the wild things from or something like wild ones from yeah yep yep our Co third or fourth official customer third and third employee yeah hey you seem to know a lot about this you want to work here I think that's kind of how we found them on YouTube so I love that but cool well thank you again for uh for stopping back and hanging out with us for for the hour and uh we'll uh we will see you all next week we will also detail all of the rest of this into a blog post that we'll put on our website um probably tomorrow uh if anything went went by a little too quick for anyone along with better better copies of those pictures so yeah and I've got I always like to throw some kind of weird little Easter egg and here's a fun one this is a prototype I'm working on right now which is a this is just a prototype but this is a roof mounted box that you can see there with a peplink in it and the concept here is this um ceiling mount right yeah actually this is a pretty crappy prototype let me show you a better prototype this this one's got the nice fancy fan bars on it and good screws and everything um so this ceiling mounts and allows you to take a peplink and mount it up if you have a pre-installed antenna in your RV that has cellular up on the roof and they're bringing they those are pre-wired so they've got 12volt power and a roof antenna on a lot of RVs so we've had this request coming in a lot you know can you install can can we put a peplink in and and use that factory antenna and the uh the answer hopefully very soon will be yes so if you're interested in being a beta customer for something like that we'd obviously have to validate that you have an antenna that will work up there which is not hard to do uh but we are looking for folks that want to uh participate in that little beta test very cool yeah that's that is our Easter egg of the week I think that's going to become a feature set for anytime you're on this P this uh this show for sure that's that's I'll try and don't worry you don't have to buy it in Orange we just our test prototypes are orange some people might like orange hey you know accent color goes well yeah with other sh colors I like it Orange Orange Box on your roof on your ceiling it's up to you no I think the default will be white so but uh we're we're uh we've been testing that and it's been great so well more to come very cool well thanks again and uh thank you every everyone that tuned in we really do appreciate it and uh we will see you next week same time same place on YouTube and Facebook so thank you all very much and we'll see you soon", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2023-11-03T09:03:14Z", "channelId": "UCE9KnGK2TcpXLlIi5cQfGvg", "title": "RV Roof Cable Entry - Keeping Water Out - Live Chat Discussion",

{"id": "kwuofYo9bHk", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "Jrsodg0DQU3-7UQQYvJBcCVSGt8", "transcript": "if you're like me and you've been looking for a solution to bring wires down from your roof that's reusable repeatable and futureproof come along with us I've got a cool solution to show you [Music] guys I'm happy to announce that after three plus years of testing I am ready to bring iotech to the RV and Marine community and tell you guys that this is an excellent solution if you're looking to bring wires from the outside to the inside regardless of their size or quantity so you might have saw some Easter eggs and some of our installation videos where we used icot products in various installs uh they were also featured in Mike wendland's video from RV lifestyle.com where we installed a a uh pretty high-end dual 5G system with a fixed Mount starlink dish and that's kind of the example of where these things shine if you've got a decent number of cables up on the roof or you're looking to maybe add solar or something else in the future you can build a futureproof uh roof entry point with these products very very easily what makes the icot tech solution so unique as I'll show you right now as I assemble one of them with a 711 antenna is that split grommet technology and what that means is that you can install these on cables that already have terminated ends or connectors already on them if you've ever kind of dealt with one of these just kind of your standard cable grommet that adjusts to tighten around a cable they're great but you have to terminate the cables after they go through the systems to make sure that they're watertight and that can really limit the installation applications plus you got to drill like 10 holes and once you install them you can't really pull the wires out and and change them out that's where the ECOT Tech system really shines so I've built this little demo box that has all sorts of different options on it that we'll go into in a little bit but to start I want to to talk to you about this which is kind of the heart of the iotex solution now there's two things that come in every I iotex solution one is a housing in this particular case this is a rectangle five slot housing and two are these split cable grommets and when you look at these cable grommets you'll notice that they have a bit of slices on the side of them and then they have whole cutouts in the middle at the diameter of each of your cables when combined together that's really where the magic happens I'll show you quickly right here just by opening one of these up this is a four slot unit that holds four grommets as you can see here you drop these grommets right into these slots creating a waterproof watertight connection for all of your accessories there's three and there's four and you'll notice with what I just put together right there each of those grommets has a different size hole hole in it to accommodate a different size wire starting with enclosures we've got kind of three main flavors we'll go through those right now now first we have our surface mount uh enclosure so there's a couple different flavors here you see there's a four slot a three slot a four slot that's in a different configuration and even a five slot here and these are really kind of designed to nicely go on the side of boxes uh spinning this around slightly different flavor we have our round mount units you've got a one slot here a two slot and up to a four slot now the rounds can be very very useful in that you just need a standard whole saw to mount these in a box like what you see here and they're quite easy to use very popular you don't have to get crazy with a flush cut or something else to cut out a square hole um like what we typically use for these we'll show you a little video of us cutting up this box uh in a little bit so you can kind of see what that looks like all right so moving on what else do we have we've got 90° mounts so you see a 90° Mount here and here this is kind of the same thing that's oriented slightly differently I wanted to show that to you so you can kind of get some ideas about some different stuff that you can do now 90° you in this orientation on the side of a box your cables are going to come out the bottom if you have a very very wet application where you think you're going to be exposed to a lot of direct pressure water this down Mount solution is going to put gravity on your sides the cables will come out the bottom now I can tell you personally we've been using a side exit out like this on a 90° for quite a while we've had no water um issues but you know if you're a sea captain and you think this thing is going to be like basically submerged a down application might be the way to go as you can see here the 90 is available in a two slot smaller compact a three this four up and then we've also got an even larger five up which you can see here as well it's also so right here moving on to grommets for a second there are grommets that are available in a single cable dual cable or four cable configuration there are also blank grommets available if you want to buy a larger housing and future proof Yourself by inserting blanks that will not have any cables coming out of them on day one all of the grommets are listed based on the diameter of the cables that will be used inside of them this for example is a 6 mm cable grommet with two slots now we've taken the guest work out of this if you're looking at anything on our store a you know pepwave antennas parsec antennas pointing antennas all of those antennas um Wi-Fi versus CER versus GPS we have bundle kits for these 5 in one 7 and one 11 in one that are all ready to go to give you exactly what you need so don't worry about that but if you have a secondary application like maybe you're bringing solar in for the roof or or something like that and you want to get some customization going here typically what we recommend to customers is they pick up one of these a small measuring tool and what this can do is allow you to measure the diameter or the outer kind of edges of the cable to tell you the thickness and it will almost always be right around five 6 7 8 or so millimeters depending on the cable and that will tell you which of these grommets corresponds to the cable size you need now if you're not sure you can always reach out to us I can tell you that whether it's starlink fixed Mount starlink Rome cellular blah blah blah we've probably seen it and we already know the cable size that you need but what if you've got three cables and you have bought a 4 cable entry system iotex thought of that as well as you can see right here this is a plug and they sell plugs for any size hole as well so if you're interested in maybe future future proofing or adding a grommet that you may not need all the wires for on day one you can pick up The Grommet and the plugs use those and then when you're ready simply pop out the plugs and put in the wires all of the iotech solutions also come with gaskets and these are really helpful if you've got slightly uneven surfaces or anything where you're worried about marrying the bottom of the uh housing with your mounting surface now in addition to that these surface mount units they do come with this as well but they also have a rubber moisture barrier around here so if you're dealing with something like a box like this where you've got a very smooth surface you don't really need this but it does come in the Box just in case for whatever application you need so when do I love my ecosystem the most well you'd probably think right the day I install it and it all works that's probably the second most the the time I like it the most is when I have to go up and change something when you know I've got to go test a new antenna or you know some new technologies come out and I've got to expand my system the fact that I can hop up on the roof and Pull Apart one of these split housings the way you just saw there and then grab access to these inserts and simply swap them out is just a lifesaver it means that I can quickly change out the entire system without messing with the box that's on my roof and get whatever into the coach that I need to now in some upcoming videos we're going to feature an installation in a deeper dive analysis of a couple different installs we did but the one for RV lifestyle with Mike wendland we installed a box very similar to this one just a bit smaller and we use the icot tech products along with a 2inch piece of PVC pipe that we brought into the interior of the RV now what we really like about that install and I'll show you some pictures here is that yes you get the iotech benefit but then that 2-in conduit is in the uh installation meaning that whenever you open up this waterproof box you've just got a very easy way to run cables in pull them out and check on everything and because that PVC pipe is raised off the roof approximately 1 to two in and then heavily dord before it is screwed down you've got a waterproof seal and if for any reason there was ever any water in the Box it's never happened to me in 3 years using these as long as you tighten them down properly and you use the proper grommets um if water ever did get into the box it would collect in the box and not go into the interior of the coach because that pipe is sticking up creating a moisture barrier preventing anything from entering the vehicle it's a very nice way to do a futureproof setup uh and depending on the size on need you can put in a large box like you see here I mean obviously no one would probably have this many iotex on the outside although I've seen some you solar guys who are pretty intense um but you can put whatever box size you need that's appropriate for your install and whatever housing and set of grommets you need and you're essentially future proofed I mean even if you went to say take everything out at a later date and you wanted to just leave the Box up there maybe you were selling your RV just pick up two or three blank grommets stick them in the system remove all the wires tighten it up and say hey I've got a really great way to get cables down if you want if you don't it's waterproof you never think about it it's just a futureproof way to get cables down in a safe and serviceable way that has worked 100% of the time for me on the road now there's a lot of different part numbers and accessories like we talked about before but check out the links in the listing below we've got a little landing page there that will help you with some of the basics so you can understand where to get started but as always you can simply reach out to us at info@ mobilus have.com you can start up

was gonna say mobile internet resource center but that's our guests Chris and Shere from the mobile internet resource center RV mobile internet.com as well as technomadia all things mobile internet and we really really appreciate them coming on today to talk about the new next generation of peplink modems so Chris so Chris and Sh before we get into that let's just talk a little just for people that haven't heard of you not that I think that there would be a lot of those people on this call but we'll just do it anyway um talk a little bit about what how you guys got into this and and where where it all comes from and why you do the the the crazy and amazing work that you do well uh Chris hit the road Solo in a stupid tiny little trailer without a bathroom in 2006 and I was crazy enough to join them after we met online a few months later yeah because you know it was um I I was a had a background in Silicon Valley actually doing mobile technology and um when Palm the Palm Pilot company imploded and I didn't want to take another Silicon Valley job I wanted to hit the road and I set off in a solar powered tiny little trailer with mobile internet it didn't need a bathroom I'm just by myself it didn't have a refrigerator didn't have air conditioning I was going to go exotic places and go paramotoring and I did not expect to meet somebody and who wanted to sell all sell her house and move into a drawer but we CLI so strongly about just about just over 17 years ago wow congratulations for that too and um I was a work from home software developer U I started that in the mid 90s I was running my own company remotely and I was alreadying doing a bunch of travel personal travel and uh working remotely tethering off my smartphone wherever I went so I told him I could I could move in with him I the new relationship energy thing kind of got over the no bath thing but um we were able to get the mobile internet and the power that I needed to be able to continue to support my clients remotely as we traveled and this is 2006 this is like the dawn of 3G we were lucky to get 3G in a lot of places most of the time and it one xrt uphill both ways you know this is really uh hughet was out there for uh satellite internet we did that for a while the pain times were crazy high but we we tried everything we did everything and we had started technomad as a a little personal blog and YouTube channel and we're I think the second rving YouTube channel on YouTube and uh we were just sharing you know about working remotely in our travels and we and and about other geekery like lithium batteries and solar and all the stuff we got so many questions about well how are you actually able to work online from the middle of all these places that how are you getting connected and um in 2013 uh my father passed away and I had run the software business with him and I had decided that I was not going to continue the software business uh without him anymore so we took a Hiatus we we actually were supposed to go on sabatical for a year and in that year we ended up launching escapers our village and the mobile internet Resource Center within a year so that's my sabatical launching compy let's not do sabatical again we're not doing that ever again that's too much work but anyway so so uh the mobile inter Resource Center as we call it Merc um that came out of basically me trying to answer all these questions uh so we wrote a book and then uh a year later that book was severely out of date because the stuff changes and we realized that a book was not the right format so we it was recommended by some of our fan base that why don't you start a weite and a membership program to support it yeah and we're like who's G to pay us to tell at the time the top option was Verizon who's going to tell us pay us to tell them to get Verizon well because there was a certain way to get a 20 gig Verizon plan which seemed huge at the time but then that all went away all of a sudden and suddenly people needed more advice and then the mobile internet Research Center started to explode that was 2014 that we launched it and back then there were two mobile hotspot devices on the market there were no cellular embedded routers there was two cellular boosters but they had not yet been approved for LTE and there was a couple of Wi-Fi pointing things and like three data plans that we had to track it seemed easy and now here we are with I think we have over 400 different options that we are tracking in our gear Center at the M Resource Center there's so many options on the market today that it gets really confusing and it uh takes a lot of work to keep on top of it all uh we now have a team of eight of us that do it and I see Andy McNab is in the chat room he'll be hi Andy just just want to wave hi to him he's he's going to help us and moderate the chat if you're on YouTube so um thank you we both both an incredible team to help with all of this and then uh thrilled to have partnered with mobile must have a few years back um working together and keeping our unbias stance um but still supporting each other and um and helping each other because we have a lot of custom of our members have chosen the gear that you guys sell so Dave actually Fields our qu the questions and supports he runs the tech support form inside our for that is absolutely correct I but we we revised my title lately to be Community manager relations slash something I don't know we're still making it up as we go but you know it's uh talking to people I guess is the n 90% of my job at this point which is good so I like talking and listening but uh so that brings us to today which is there's the we we launched the br1 and br1 pro and the br2 pro I think last year but but now there's yeah now there's a new version with with a new chipset let's start with what's a chipset well and and it's kind kind of goes back to what is a modem is the it's a little piece inside of a cellular device that translates the digital signals into radio waves that go broadcast out over the air which are inherently analog and does the reverse it does the um you know the the demodulating modulating and demodulating is turning the analog signals coming in from an antenna into a digital signal so it's kind of can I non-geek that a little bit you can non-geek that a little bit it basically makes the wireless signals from the air turn into data on your device that you can use to get online to get internet it's it's the magic little piece that converts things to internet okay yeah so and the the the the company that is kind of the the dominant company when it comes to 5G and making 5G modems is a company called Qualcomm from San Diego they've been the the leader in 5G and cell in Cellular in general but they're particularly when it comes to 5G they're kind of the go-to place for their chips for 5G chips and particularly in the United States for certain historical reasons and they you know just like 4G before it and 3G before that the it's not just like oh you're 3G compatible there's every year or two years or so the chips evolve and something new comes along that takes better advantage of the standards the standard evolves to have more capabilities and so there's new chipsets new modems come out that enable better capabilities and we're kind of at one of those major inflection points for 5G where we've going from kind of the first wave of 5G devices to actually what the industry really is calling 5G Phase 2 that's the what they're calling the the release 16 of the 5G technical standard is 5G Phase 2 and the new modems that we're we're going to be talking about the new Modo modules and chipsets inside the uh the New Ping devices are the first of the 5G Phase 2 compatible devices for routers for routers it's very important to note devices like smartphones and mobile hotspot devices have had this generation of modum for over a year now routers at Enterprise level what like peplink uh specializes in they always will Trend a year or two behind the consumer Market in this sort of Technology number one they're dealing with a Enterprise customer who needs stability they have to be Rock Solid they also have to go through much more rigid uh certification process of the FCC and all the carriers so it just takes longer and and and also part the biggest part well yeah the biggest part of it is that they are the Enterprise market and the router Market is teeny teeny tiny compared to the number of chips that um Apple and Samsung buy and so when they're bringing out a new generation they get first dibs on the latest and greatest stuff so so phones you you'll always kind of face this is like well why am I paying so much more for an Enterprise device that is seems like it's way out of date compared to a phone well it's it some ways it is but it's what you can do with it it's kind of like a a truck versus a Miata you know the truck is going to give you a lot more general purpose capabilities but if you're just going to be writing down a twisty little connectivity Road well you got a Miata it's exactly yep and I and I think that's such a an important point in this space too is that one obviously the technology companies are going to default to the to the the biggest draw right which is you know people everybody walks around with a phone a smartphone these days not everybody walks around with a Enterprise Mobile router strapped to their back they don't who are these people exactly well I mean everybody but us I guess right I think we all at least have five right we were we were doing a uh a meeting earlier and Eric was showing his personal setup that's in his RV to a customer and the customer was just looked at the sheer number of connections that he had and just went blank like I can't believe that's how you operate but that's how we have to operate because we have know that's why we're all experts on what we do is because we have hands-on experience with all the options I think and let's face it we really like it too like that's a big part of it usually yeah but you know sometimes there Simplicity in just hot spotting off my smartphone true and and and it's nice to have that option and actually sometimes like I've had up to 11 connections I think is my current bonding record for our Max br2 I've had 11 way bonding going but sometimes it's nice to have this be one one of those connections via um Wi-Fi as W so you've got your phone in the mix as well but then you take your phone with you in your pocket and you can go to a coffee shop so it's um kind of kind of fun to to to just have all these different tools for different jobs and you know certainly for building in an integrated connectivity solution for a boat or an RV a cellular integrated router is much more appropriate for the job than a smartphone assuming you have more than one device that you're trying to get online and a lot of us travel with full mobile networks with dozens of devices Wireless and wired inside of our RVs and boats and I think that's become so much more common too with this this sort of distributed Workforce concept where everybody is working from the road or doesn't have to necessarily be in an office because the the telepresence and and connectivity has gotten so much better over the last few years as a result I mean I remember right when the pandemic started all of a sudden all the home all the residential networks got really really slow oh yeah because it from work for home yeah exactly and streaming Netflix yeah and and streaming Netflix of course so because that's important too proba probably it just only it depends on the time of day right right you know during the day it's it's Zoom meetings and at night it's Netflix for sure but so when the br1 Pro launched and when the br2 pro launched they had an x55 chip set is that correct correct so that is the phase one technology of 5G and when those launched at that time smartphones were already in phase two yeah basically about yeah um and so the so it's you know and and it kind we kind of went through the same sort of thing at the the beginning of 4G that's why we we were so key to it is like when the first 4G devices came out there in in the 4G there was modem categories and the first devices were category three and four and they were fine and they could do 4G things but they could basically connect to just a single Channel at once and when the category six devices came along and they could combine multiple channels suddenly you got a whole lot more capability and those Category 6 devices had a lot longer I guess kind of shelf life you know the viability life you know all the way through the the 4G error where they they could run circles around those kind of first wave of 4G devices so we should should Define that when you're talking about channels each cellular carrier broadcasts over multiple channels just like on television you have multiple channels some of them are short range some of them are long range some have more capacity for more Spectrum I.E faster speeds than others are slower so basically longer range the longer range the slower stuff so when you can combine multiple channels then you start to get the advantages of using multiple connections at once so you get the benefits of distance as well as speed and and also of just avoiding congestion behind the scenes too I mean that that's the biggest thing for the carriers is they're they're trying to to spread their capacity around and avoid congestion and you know get the the the um least number of people calling into to complain is basically their ultimate goal and so these phase one 5G chips the x55 one of the features that it did not have was it was not able so 5G not only are there multiple channels they are broken up into segments so there's long range 5G so these are the signals that can go M like 15 20 miles and then there are mid-range ones that are more in the one to two mile range and those are the ones you're maybe up to five so they're they're broken up into mid-range and long range and then there's also millimeter wave which is like super that's what you find in an airport or Stadium us Nomads we just forget millimeter waves out there US city Folk we get the millimeter wave stuff where I can hold it out and get gigabit speed on my phone but but as Nomads unless we're camped outside a stadium or an airport we're not going to be dealing with millimeter wave so let's just we're we're talking mid midband and long range are the two that we're most interested in the x55 modem chipset is not able to combine midband Spectrum in with long range it can do carrier aggregation within midband and within long range with the multiple channels within it but it can't cross okay and so so behind the scenes there's kind of a lot of different kind of complicated things but the um the know and and I guess the other important thing to to know about about 5G is 5G particularly at first and we're still kind of in this era of 5G 5G is layered on top of 4G so the x55 is great 4G modem and often it would be layering one channel of 5G on top of several channels of 4G um and it gets it can build up some really really capable performance out of that but this kind of the the the second phase of 5G devices can combine together multiple different 5G channels and they also that makes it more likely to be able to enable what's called 5G Standalone mode which means 5G without any 4G under the hood so 5G running natively which the pure four the pure 5G basically the pure 5G which which you know the the big thing that that gives you in a real world is that gives you lower latency because 5G has been designed from the get-go to evolve over the next 10 years from you know 20 30 millisecond latencies getting down to two millisecond latencies at some point down the road whereas 4G is basically peaked at around you know 30 40 50 millisecond latency so that that's that constant overhead that's always on every connection um so once you're able to turn off 4G and you're no longer combining 4G suddenly your latencies could potentially get better and and over time as 5G Standalone is more and more deployed can get sub substantially better so work what what this kind of like this phas change between 5G Phase 1 and 5G Phase 2 is it's kind of Paving the way for the the next five years of 5G evolving and getting better and the current generation the F 5G phase one devices will still work and they'll still work great they'll still do wonderful things but they're going to be less able to take advantage of the networks evolving so Standalone mode where you're combining a a long range low band with a um a mid-range midband and running that in Standalone mode and getting the benefits of super fast speed and still getting the longer range and and you get that because oftentimes you can hear the tower's midband but the tower can't hear you if you're trying to talk a midband because you're tiny compared to the tower so if you're able to transmit up with your long long range signal and your usually your uploads don't matter all that much the tower can talk to you with midband so that's a great thing to be able to combine low band and midband you get the long range talking back to the to Tower and you get the fast with the tower talking back to you okay these are these are things that the the first generation of 5G modems just don't fundamentally have the capability to do and the next wave well does so it's it's that's a pretty exciting tech tech change there the other uh thing that x55 did not have is AT&T's n77 use they bought a whole bunch of Spectrum which been called by analysts Andromeda it has no official name um this was defined androma is a good name for it one of my favorite galaxies you know exactly so this spectrum was defined after the x55 chipsets came out so they're only built into the phase two and above chipsets now why is this important because that is where AT&T is going to be deploying their midband spectrum is that important today not so much I mean this here here this is our coverage app that we wrote got to zoom in a lot to see see the little blue dots there those are the only places as of about a week ago when we pulled these Maps down um that AT&T has midband spectrum they only really started deploying it about late last 2022 yeah and and in particular in in and AT&T is kind of their midband is split in half so some of it is well is x55 compatible but the bulk of it particularly the bulk of it going forward is not and so having a a modem that is is compatible with to the the x62 and x65 and the newer Generations um particularly for AT&T customers um you have the potential to see a lot more of what AT&T's real Next Generation 5G capabilities are so the AT&T's 5G Nationwide which they've turned on in a whole lot of places is basically just 4G with a slight Advantage the the 5G midband which is really does show you some oh wow that is impressive performance they're just turning that on and they're just fundamentally not compatible with that first generation so for AT&T customers in particular you know not only does it give you the future proofing of you know being better able to do the carry aggregation of multiple 5G bands the newer modems will just talk to a lot of AT&T spectrum that the old modem older modems just cannot see it's invisible too okay okay that that that all seems to make sense to my gorilla brain at this point so but um where where do you see this going in terms of capability for people like you know where where's a where where would this be helpful to people um so so yeah I guess the question is also like you know if you've already have an x-55 device does it make sense to jump to an x62 immediately immediately you know these these have just come out as far as in the router side of things so we just got our x62 equipped um Max br2 Pro and we've got in the cabinet we're broadcasting via the x55 version which is basically identical other than the modem inside so we're going to be starting to test these head-to-head in various places looking for places where we can actually see a real Advantage um with the newer modem just see how prevalent it is today I we'll be sharing those testing notes with our our members which uh you can join through mobile mus have or directly with us um to get those testing notes but we'll be doing some head-to-head comparatives just to see what the differences are now when we compare a mobile hotspot device or a phone that already has the phase two against our x55 we've already seen some differences over in the last year yeah yeah there there are some places you know par so so the the people who should be most paying attention are people on AT&T um just because AT&T is right now basically turning up that Andromeda Spectrum around the country and it is invisible to the older devices so it can definitely have some advantages on AT&T um um but keep in mind um consider what AT&T data plan you have yes because on some of the sweet 18t Legacy data plans like the unlimited plus hotspot plan or the connected car Mobly plan those are LTE only plans they're not getting 5G at all so if you're using those as your main AT&T connection don't even worry about 5G with it sck with your 4G you're good to go yeah no problem wor about X5 versus x62 you're not getting at all you you potentially benefit though because people switching to 5G free up more 4G Spectrum so some um 4G stuff might get faster in the time frame before AT&T starts to phase out 4G and push it towards 5G but but yeah hey you know it's it those plans are locked to 4G no no putting it in a fancier device is going to help um you know these these 5G devices the x55 and the x62 both are great 4G devices so there's no downside to it but they're not going to get the 5G connectivity at all um so they'll miss out on all the Next Generation speeds um and and and let's say let's say it was a customer like that if they took that SIM card and put it into a an x62 it would work it would just default a 4G or it's gonna use the the category 24g modem inside instead of the 5G yeah and and and we do that we have that we have those plans and and they're they're they're good plans um but they will just AT&T's 5G Network says ignores them you know they're they don't at the network won't allow them to connect because the the way the plans are provisioned um other people who might be really compelled to want to be on a Next Generation modem is the the new generation supports the bands that Dish Network where the nation's new fourth carrier is rolling out it it has more support for the bands that dish network is deploying that the x-55 era did not so not a lot of people are on Dish but it is actually there there are some interesting data plans there we've had some good success with our dish plans um and if you are on Dish well then being on something that will take advantage of everything they're doing is a is a good reason to be on a Next Generation modem now when you say Dish Network you mean that like the same people that used to be the other like the not Direct TV but satellite TV people so when a T-Mobile purchase Sprint and that acquisition and merger is now complete part of that uh deal was that they had to create give Spectrum or make it make it available to a new fourth carrier and Dish Wireless was selected to become the nation's fourth carrier to replace what they are building a completely 5G Network right now they only offer smartphone plans for a while they had a hotspot plan uh which we use uh it's currently not offered so there's no great options for dish but it will be coming back dish will be becoming an option in the future um so having a gear that can support dish networks's unique frequency vans uh will become important probably in a year or two I think yeah and and so that's it um T-Mobile has been the leader in deploying 5G technology so they're already um for phones at least doing a lot of this 5G carrier aggregation stuff where you can see some really amazing benefits of combining the long range and the midband um so we're eager to see and try and find places where we see those benefits showing up on the routers and um to see whether how well that actually plays out in the field uh the theoretical advantages and then the people who are like least likely to see benefits in the short term is Verizon um Verizon has had a really great 5G network but most of what they've deployed so far the x55 is very very well suited for so you're probably and we're going to look be looking for to see the real world differences because the the newer modems do have other advantages around being more sensitive and stuff like that but um theoretically on paper Verizon has the least current current day benefits to be seen from potential new modems so so so basically those that are using uh T-Mobile and AT&T 5G data plans are going to most benefit from an x62 modem now um and and theor and and again we're looking to to to try and prove the test the theories and see how well they match reality um there is that's I think the thing that we love the most about you guys is that you you fall under that same concept of trust but verify that that that I was always taught as a kid through science class and stuff like that and and the fact that you put all of this into real world um practice and testing it out in the real world in all of your various modes of transportation boats bands buses I think it's phenomenal so um it's very very cool stuff just I just want to pause for a second and remind people that if you do have a question for Chris ande this is a great this is one of those great opportunities to ask the oracles if you will on on how to on on on internet questions so I'm just gonna prompt that out there please place a a comment in in on Facebook or on YouTube um but but let's keep going um where sort of what's the next what's next I guess like are people worried that is there going to be an x63 chip or so there is actually so the x62 there is an x65 variant already out there and that's what smartphones and a lot of hotspots are using that's the one that covers the millimeter wave yes as well and and and it's it's actually kind of interesting because as far as is as the raw CPU power inside the modem the um the there qualcom is there reolution is there was the x50 which was super limited the x55 was kind of the first mainstream one then they had an x60 which was just on phones and had some of the advantages then there was the x65 that you know hit the hit a lot of phones last year that's the first of these 5G phe 2 the x62 is kind of the budget version of the x65 so it doesn't have it doesn't have full support for mil it actually technically does have M but it has a basically a slower CPU inside of it so in some way on paper the x62 can handle can process less data than the x55 can um interesting it is it is a lower-end device because it's it because it doesn't need to handle the millimeter wave you know the potential multi- gigabit speeds of a millimeter wave connection and again the like the peplink routers we're talking about like the br2 pro and the br1 pro they're gigabit routers they they can't process more than a gigabit per second speed anyway so even if the modem was able to give them faster speed than that the router would be the bottleneck so theoretically there shouldn't be actual disadvantage of going from an x-55 that could if it was hooked up to millimeter wave and had other you know in lab conditions could process more data than x62 um but we'll be we'll be interesting to see there there might be certain cases or certain signal situations where the x55 might actually have a slight advantage and I'll be kind of looking for that but because of all the other real world you know extra capabilities and of being a a phase 2 compatible modem the x62 I think in almost all cases all that I can think of it seems like it has fundamental advantages that the x55 doesn't have but the 65 is the higher end version that's the that's the real sequel that's the Cadillac of minivan so to speak Cadillac but now as far as other ones so the iPhone 14 sorry 15 that I just got um this one has x70 in it and x75 is already in development yeah x75 should usually they the Samsung Galaxies are the first phones in the us to bring a new modem out so in January Samsung will announce the next gen Galaxy and that'll have a 75 the 75 is the first of modems that will be what they're calling 5G Advanced so it's a it's another step in the 5G standards um but it's the the kind of the sweet spot for me of like what we have really long legs is 5G Phase 2 the the 5G Advanced and the X 75s will enable m mul gigabit connections and things that can go go crazy but the the the x65 the 5G pH 2 generation supports basically all the bands that matter and supports combining them in a lot of really good ways so it's a a standard that I think will last long as far as routers go all of the router manufacturers have in the last six months have rolled out their x62 I don't think cradle Point has yet no cradle Point has not they're so Ping's ahead of as far as Enterprise go but you know we also track inst connect and never heard of this cradle point I'm just kidding so all these other ones you know earlier this year they all got x62 so they've had it for a while but the Enterprise ones are a little slower but the Moto modules that the routers use probably are not going to be going to x70 anytime soon not not to that it seem it seems like the modules skip a generation so they went 55 to 65 and then maybe in another year and a half or so two years there'll be the X 75s will come to modules but I don't think that'll necessarily um become a a big deal for routers and the technology will continue evolving until 6G around 2030 is when we'll start to see 6G start to show up a whole new wave of things um I hope we're all retired by then I'm just kid um but yeah the the generations the G is cellular generations and they're basically designed to have a new generation every 10 years because it gives them a chance to rethink the standards and stu um but yeah we we're we're in in a pretty good place and I'm I feel feel good future proofing on paper at least with the 6265 generation and um and whereas up up until this point we we when the 55 all the devices with the 55 came out from the day they launched we always said be aware these have a limited shelf life they're going to be missing out on some really core capabilities and now we got the Next Generation so now and also now the cell networks have evolved to the point that it really matter that it that the cellet 5G networks weren't a big they've ramped up a lot but like two years ago it's like it wasn't really worth don't invest in 5G gear now like all the carriers all four carriers have great and getting better 5G networks so we've been in the last month or two really revising a lot of our content to go from hey if you're ready for 5G and you're you know yeah you can start investing but now that routers and hotspots and smartphones and the carrier networks are really solidly in their 5G deployments now is time to if youve still been in an LTE world now it's time to start considering 5G and if you're ready to invest in New Gear um peplink GE with the x62 is where you want to start don't go buy do not buy an x55 at this point new yes well sorry I was just going to say I I think there there's something there in in there's always an early adopter I think tax if you will that that that people just you you accept for being early on the cusp then technolog is gonna move it's just kind of what happens things go from that early adopter to kind of that mainstream and in particularly the x62 chip was you know that's the reason it's the cost reduced chip it's it's it's the little brother of the x65 it's designed to be um a very mainstream 5G chip for a very long long time um and that's actually why I was very pleased that you know peplink they didn't have to raise the price of the routers when they offered this new generation of Chip because in some ways it's it's it's going from the flagship of an x-55 to a mainstream product line of the x62 um the the they could have held out longer and gotten an x65 modem module but it would the mo module then would probably outclass the router and those modules aren't certified and in production yet so they'd be waiting longer for something that would outclass the router so I think the x62 was the the the smart thing for the router manufacturers to to invest in at the moment and I I want to read this comment I just saw in the chat from Vince Walker he said they just got I'll put it up on screen for yeah there we go he went on AT&T and T-Mobile they were getting uh 80 to 90 megabits per second down with their old one and they went to 625 down and 28 up so that is keeping mind that was going from a cat 18 so a high-end LTE router to going to the the x62 yes that's a big jump not that 80 to 90 is anything to be upset about but but you I mean that's that's you know splitting hairs if we will I mean I I I remember the early days of WiFi with 80211 B and you're lucky to get five megabits over Wi-Fi let alone cellular so yeah yeah so yeah that's it's the the the the technology has evolved quite a bit and and particularly if you're coming from you know you can see some dramatic jumps going to LTE if particularly pay attention if there's midband deployed in your area and you're able to get tune into those midband signals um we're we're next place we're gonna aim to do some testing we're trying to find a place that has midband on all the carriers and I think Las Vegas we might be able to find some near there so those are the places we're hoping to most likely see some real world x55 versus X6 head to Death Valley we're not going to get an advanc Death Valley will be just using starlink in next days yeah something about those Canyons don't really go play well with cellul right that's where Starling comes into the mix and that's where it's really nice to have a router that can combine uh um satellite with cellular because you know that gives you the the amazing punch and particularly for uploads where starlink is often very marginal you get the great starlink downloads and the the great cellular uploads and suddenly you're really able to get some work done yeah or or a Netflix stream so um let's see if we have any other questions here from dump dump dumpson at7 he had a question about NSA versus sa yeah that's a yeah there we go yeah no the the NSA so the yeah 5G NSA means that the government NSA is listening to all your connectivity no no not that NSA and it's not no strings attached it's not no strings attached that that is the the kind of the two different when 5 actually first launched the standard wasn't quite ready to exist without 4G so 5G um NSA means non Standalone it's 5G is sitting basically like a turbo layer on top of 4G and 4G is actually primarily your Uplink your uploads are all still happening over 4G in NSA at the very beginning was 4G was upload 5G was download which is fine but it does have all that extra latency because 4G just doesn't H it wasn't designed as a low latency um protocol and um and it's does require basically two halves of the modem to be active and working together and it's it's whatever um it's fine but um essay 5G Standalone is letting the 4G half of the modem completely go to sleep which can be more power efficient it allows for um then lower latencies and all the carriers will eventually be turning on 5G sa right now T-Mobile does support it they support both NSA and sa connections um I don't think AT&T or I I've heard a little bit of Verizon testing happening with sa I don't think AT&T has started doing any deployment of sa yet um Dish Network is saay to begin with because they're 5G only they're they're and they're they're starting from scratch essentially yeah they're starting from scratch um so this is a kind of a long-term thing and the x55 supports both NSA and sa but in essay it can't combine ex different bands together and nearly as the way the x62 can so in some ways the um x55 I I often when it connects via saay um the the peplink firmware lets you specify saying essay only and you can do that on on T-Mobile and force an sa connection and stuff and but you can't force NSA only and sometimes I'm like no the ESS is actually not good because it's an x55 and I'm not getting the combination of the low and high band I'd rather be 4G plus 5G and you can't force that and I've suggested to peplink that they add a one of those selections be no Force NSA don't disable the 4G modem even if the network is saying switched essay so yeah that's just different phases essay is the future but it's um but there's a transition phase it's definitely a transition phase I think that's a good thing to highlight though is is the relationship from a a listening point of view I think peplink really does listen to you guys as subject matter experts in this space um and and us too from that standpoint but they they have made tweaks to either firmware versions or or different things based on suggestions that you guys have had um I I I I don't think a lot of people really know that so um no we we have a a lot of Our member feedback so when our members we see our members asking about futures or complaining about things things in our forums or in our webinars we take it to peping they they actually have a monthly call with us where Chris gets to tell them what to do and I do um but they I am genuinely impressed with that they not only listen and ask for that feedback but I would say 95% of the things we ask for they do it's so for this they listen to our members we are advocates for our members and having the best The Experience so companies that are willing to listen um and provides their products for what consumers want and and and they tend to really appreciate our Real World experience in because we we use products very differently than Enterprises do we you know rvers and cruisers are often in very Fringe areas and are willing to spend time tweaking their connections to try and do whatever it takes so that they can work from a beautiful place like the base of a mountain or in a canyon or some remote National Park or Forest and so so we Death Valley or Death Valley if there yeah that that there's no cell towers there so go so far we decided not to go into Death Valley today so that we could do this so we did we didn't I appreciate that as the you know the crazy person running these streams so thank you um uh there was another question here uh recommendation for Canada cellular um they have a pep wve with a SIM card I mean I I know you guys have a pretty decent Forum in terms of our our set of posts about different data plans count mobile internet.com Canada is our guide to as our member Guide to the options in Canada so it really just depends upon how long you're going to be up there uh what data plans you have there's some that roam like a lot of AT&T plans do roam uh our members have access through mobile must have a Canada option now um yeah that's it's actually and then really the be the easiest thing is starlink um starlink Mobile plan is the best because then you don't have to worry about the Canadians limited uh cellular footprint um yeah that's that's that's that's a good way to look at it I mean the the star the starlink the fact that it can sort of cross borders by default because it's not on the mobile plan only only on the mobile plan if you're on this we use the standard plan uh by default to get the higher priority data so that works in the US yeah starlink has made things complicated there's different tiers of plans and we've got a guides and videos going over all the the tricks of starlink and picking your plan but but yeah for moving between those are guides by the way that I reference pretty much weekly if not daily sometimes talking to our customers trying to help them pick the right things so right so we actually so they said that they were gonna look into starlink so we have a brand new guy that we just refreshed last week in a video series on starlink at rvm internet.com starlink um so all the latest information is there as long as well as the plan options perfect okay noris had a question about Dish Network up there as well yeah let me see if I can find where' that go it's like are they still in restricted areas or the service available Nationwide so they are expanding the cities that they have availability I just updated coverage maps yesterday on our cellular data plan guide um or cellular carrier guide uh so you still can only get service if you have a billing address in one of those areas where they have service but when you are traveling they are currently roaming without limitations everywhere on AT&T and T-Mobile so yes so so so dish is that that's kind of dish now they no longer have the data only plans because they're waiting for a new hot spot to come out that supports their Oddball bands and that you have some more capability than the first ones they were selling but um we since we did get a hotspot plan and we have it in our pink router and it's become one of our favorite plans because it's $20 a month and it roams on to AT&T and it often goes faster than AT&T native plans because our AT&T native plan is a speed cap plan because that's where their business plans are and the dish plan is not speed CA so it's it is been kind of I feel like I'm almost cheating dish of like we are because we know they are paying a dollar to a150 per gigabyte when roing and our $20 plan that not sustainable but you know what they have not capped it yet yes so they have they how to cap their roaming and so if if you do get a dish plan dish their Network is still it it is being put together with um duct tape and bailing wire and it is on 5 and hopes and dreams yeah yeah so so it has glitches it has more downtime than any other carrier it when when you're roaming the downside is even though you get those crazy fast speeds You' have a lot of latency because everything has to go through dishes Central server so you get 200 millisecond latencies you get noticeably laggy latencies um when you're not on a dish native Tower which their native towers are still kind of few and far between but it has been a kind of a fun plan to have for $20 a month and hopefully you can they they yeah they have not offered it probably in four or five months yeah so hopefully that one comes back as an option it's just a nice it's not gonna be your main plan the latency makes it uncomfortable to use sometimes but uh it is still kind of a fun plan for the price and I their network is just going to keep getting better over time assuming they don't crash it but yeah yeah see nor Norris was also saying T-Mobile does not like two to three months of braam off yes but most of the cellular us regular carriers have about their their terms for roaming internationally including Canada Mexico or Alaska in this case actually about two months and yeah T-Mobile is always roaming in Alaska they do not have native coverage in Alaska um so yeah you definitely need to shop your plans we have a a guide also to Alaska RV mobile internet.com Alaska for our our members as well um yeah so yeah you really have to know your plans and the roaming limitations on it and what your own needs are and weigh those against each other and all of our cont content is written to help you assess your needs and find the things that work work for you and then our forums if you need guidance uh we all interact in there to to assist as well Y and then we we do have a comment here from uh rural internet prepper that I think funny there are many bonding options why do we always talk about pepwave well one we're a mobile we we mobilus have.com and we're a peplink retailer when they but now at the mobile resource Center we cover all mobile internet options and we have a full guide to bonding RV mobile internet.com bonding for our members that uh we actually go over the other options that are out there including speedify there's some ways to build your own bonding stuff um you know what what has steered us to point so many people towards peplink is um they make it easy and relatively affordable to do bonding um but there's um you know bonding is complicated I see he's got a follow-up question is you know check check our guide because there is a lot of um I guess confusion around bonding and there's there's different levels of redundancy that come into play whether you're just using um you want to have a quick failover so you've got like a backup connection or whether you want to have load balancing where you're kind of round rining your data out over two different connections or true bonding where you have to have a server on the other end so you have to have a service provider of some sort that is um taking your combined connection and then you know putting it back together and sending it out to the Internet so it's a two-way street and that's why peplink does such a good job of this is when they started offering speed Fusion connect protect they are affordably providing a service that acts as the bonding server um and then it works just with a few clicks with their router so that's why it is a VPN and there are downsides to using a VPN I always know when we are on a bonded connection because I go to book a reservation at a campground and so many campground reservations block VPN service Rivers because there's so many robots out there trying to snag reservations so they're blocking it so I'll go to book a reservation like I was just trying to book one in Nevada last week and I was on a speed fusion bonded connection and I couldn't go to the Nevada site I had to get off the bonded connection you try to order a pizza when you're in Nevada it wants to order your pizza in Minnesota or something right now we're using a bonding server in San Francisco so it'll be like hey so again in our bonding guide we do talk about the tradeoffs and then in some of our Advanced configuration webinars we've talked about how to divvy up your traffic so that things like Zoom you know things where or video conferences like this where things you don't want to have any drops go over bonding but things that are you don't care about like you know things that buffer really well or that you don't mind a little bit of glitches go over a non-bonded connection um like particularly Netflix and stuff you don't want to send Netflix over bonding and well and Netflix will detect that as a VPN and block it anyway usually so there's there's a lot of kind of complications particularly if you think I just want to magically have everything go bonded all the time it's not that easy yeah that's it is a little tricky um but you can get pretty fancy with it and also just turn it on when you need it turn it off when you don't too so we in our peplink Resource Center that we've co-built with the folks that mobile must have we have guides to speed fusion and bonding and all the options out there then we have our um manufacturer agnostic guide to bonding as well it goes deeper into the other options are out there so if you're one of our members go check all that content out yeah if you're not a member come Jo absolutely the other the other thing I was going to point out there too is your the webinar you guys did on outbound policies and how to manage those sort of Route some traffic over a speed Fusion tunnel or speed Fusion connect protect tunnel versus not all traffic is one of the most amazing guides that that that conversation alone is worth the membership to me um it's really really interesting so and and Incredibly helpful to people because you you've broken it down into to a a pretty cool way we'll give Eric credit because he was part of that too obviously oh yeah yeah it's fun to geek out with Eric and we always learned from each other about absolutely so so every month we get together with Eric of mobile musthave and we do a a webinar with him for our members and we dive deep into a topic uh the topic that we'll be covering in November uh is I'll be doing that with Eric is we will be discussing all the current peplink router options that our audience tends to gravitate towards and how to choose the right one for you so whether you want a single 5G a dual LTE or a dual 5G which how do you balance what is and also the balance how do you bance option for you cost versus features so we'll be tackling that topic in November that's gonna be that's that's going to be a fun one to watch for sure uh we have another question here from Michael is it required to have two peplink devices to bond that's a I mean it's a good question so so so for peplink their their speed Fusion bonding technology um it's it is their proprietary protocol for bonding and you have to have peplink software on both ends of the connection um whether that is your peplink router in in your RV or your boat and you can actually if you know how to host a server you can run peplink speed fusions Cloud solo and host your own server somewhere on the internet to be the other side of the connection or peplink sells very easily and cheaply $40 for a terabyte their speed Fusion protect service which just a click or two you can be using their server to do it or for a lot of Enterprises they actually have their own they they do peping Hardware on both ends of the connection and do a completely you know Hardware based bonding so you have to have something running peplink software it's not necessarily a device but it has to be something on either end of the connection yep Y and I was thinking of this question in terms of two devices locally but you you I think you you keyed in on what Michael was saying better than what I was thinking um you you do need two internet connections to bond together on on the one end because bonding one connection do yeah I've seen people try it doesn't really go well but again tech support forums but um and then lastly here it looks like Norris we've got a question what are the benefits of upgrading firmware and how easy is it I I I you know with with benefit new features plug fixes security fixes yeah we we we for every major peping firmware update we do have a news article we just did one for 8.4 which just came out which has kind of marginal new features for most of our audience but 8.3 that came out early early in 2023 had a ton of great features so you know che check the the the articles about any updates and particularly if you are sensitive um wait a few weeks after a new update comes out to see if they have a 0.1 update or you know quick bug fixes that go on top of any major update so they they tend to go into beta and and of the mobile must have team and us were on the beta we're going through every of the release candidates Chris is constantly sending them bug reports as well as others and they do release those betas out to public and we usually have a member Forum thread where people are talking about the new features and Ping's forums do as well um so they do a really good job of trying to get them stable but technology and so and and it's just just I guess one pro tip for avoiding breaking a router because anything upgrading the firmware bad things can happen if the power goes out while the firmware upgrade is underway or your connection drops while your firmware is update is underway that never happens in a mobile environment yeah so so save your firmware updates for when you have reliable power and reliable internet it 99% of the time if something goes wrong during a firmware update nothing nothing bad happens but that one% of time if your router is new enough you'll be a warranty claim or it's actually less than 1% time it's pretty rare but youd never want to Temp tempt the fates when it comes to Firmware updates particularly on something a device you rely on so make sure you've got reliable power and connectivity um and then I I think I pretty almost all the time firmware updates tend to work out just fine yeah and that's the those are those are the principles of risk mitigation I think go really well with firmware updates I think it's also cool to note that most peplink routers if not all at this point have a feature where they'll Save the Last firmware that you applied as an option when you go to the reboot menu so let's let's say you make the jump to a.4 and it doesn't work or something you could something as long as you can get back to that interface you can roll it back pretty quickly you can also do it through in control too which is such a great feature but yep yeah so that's that's basically the advantages there very cool well this has been so much fun I really love the fact that we we get we could get together and talk like this and thank you so much for taking the time I think I think we already know there's going to be a followup to to talk about all your findings um in in the months ahead too so we're GNA have you guys back as often as and if you're one of our members you can follow along Chris is doing updates to it almost at every stop and yeah I got a I got a thread of some interesting tips I've already figured out with the x62 from our first place and now we got to go find some other interesting places so so check the forms for that and then once they're digested they'll percolate out into the public content and we also have the br1 um and our team member Dan Heming uh he has that and he's doing some testing to the transit 5G if you remember that device from many years yeah so he's got that one and he's also got a uh Transit Duo LTE device so he's testing it against those as well for us in the field and uh so between the two of these Geeks they'll be able to be sharing a lot of testing notes also our antenna Guru Andy Hall we have a lot of Andes on our team and our Collective plus we've got our Andy too I mean our antenna Guru we have a dedicated antenna Guru so he goes in with a spectrum analys analyzer and looks at stuff uh mobile M have just sent him the new peplink 82g uh and the P the the parseek Husky which are both designed to go with this you see all these antennas here it takes a lot of antennas to do a dual 5G device you know eight four two 4x4 um 5G antennas plus two Wi-Fi antennas plus GPS so that's 11 antennas hook up to the back of this um and you know if you want to hook it up to the roof the 82g is now an antenna that has all of that in one roof antenna with just a lot of cables coming down the parac has has offered their version of the Pyrenees for quite a much longer that mobile must have has been selling so now there's two options there's two 8 by8 cellular antennas on the market so uh mobile mus have has been very transparent and given us samples of both for our antenna Guru he'll be dissecting them and looking into them and uh giving some uh feedback to our members as to which one is going to give better performance and really intend has come down to which one can you install easiest on Europe and what looks best I think I think that's and and what looks cool yeah absolutely I mean that's that's like half of my experience with everything Aesthetics count more than performance very good well thank you again so much we really do appreciate it and uh we'll we'll catch you guys on the road we can't wait to hear the next report all right thanks for having us Dave it's great to to geek out together absolutely thank you and uh we'll uh we'll we'll we'll see you guys next week when we're going to talk about some some really interesting I products from a company called iotech that are uh going to make it a lot easier for people to install a lot of these great antennas so that's that's going to be our feature next week with with Eric or Andy or both maybe we'll see how see see which which of the hats with the cats we can hurt into the the live stream here but thank you all very much and have a wonderful

us today we have the one the only the man of men Andy Andy how are what an intro what an intro we're good we're good I've been working on that I like it yeah no it's good we're um it's been a very busy week with our Prime sale event kind of happening so seeing a tail end of that a little bit of breathing space but very excited to jump on this and kind of talk through it and kind of we're looking at this week yeah so the topic for this week I mean we've done four shows in a row about the internet and this show five we are not going to talk about the internet today yeah we're changing it up in we instead are gonna talk about another element of uh of RV life now be water that would be water um you know I think the best thing to to to do here is is really talk about how we found uh blue Technologies and then how I I think it's important to highlight how much of a factor you've been involved in their product development with this sure in the sense that I think their gen one product um you you had a lot of input on right yeah yeah it was it was a really cool product from the beginning and and now a lot of it hasn't changed um so we kind of helped found round out kind of the rough edges um in the usability kind of customer experience side that's where we really were able to be beneficial the technology from Blue from the beginning has been phenomenal in their filters so the filters have been been awesome and Rock Solid through the whole time where we came in was helping them with like housings and the quick connect side and making um from an RV standpoint in traveling extremely usable and just really easy to use um and that helped blue who was really good on the engineering of the filter side really bring it into the RV space uh and be such an amazing product yeah because let's face it just like any other mobile thing like I think about me carrying cameras around or um and just travel in general things get bounced around right I mean the the yeah the housings that hold these filters because I think you're right I don't think anyone would would would disagree that the filters were strong the strong suit of the product all the way through so um Now by by beefing up those housings and making them sort of I won't call them bulletproof but you know feels like it a lot stronger yeah that's an interesting armest have there yeah we'll talk about in a second yep so you know talk a little bit about how much you've been involved with them in in terms so I got a I got a beta system in October of 21 that was when I first started testing this um and we didn't go to market until probably October November of 22 really pushing these and um doing a big marketing campaign for him so we had over a year of testing um and thousands and thousands of gallons run through my RV with my family of uh four to five between that time frame so you know we we didn't we adding five four add five in the process of that right yeah yeah um we didn't you know at M in general we don't sell anything we don't test we don't believe in we don't travel with ourselves between Eric and myself and and the other rvers in the company um so everything gets very rigorously tested uh we wanted to make sure that the longevity was there that it held up well it was easy to use it was stuff we were excited about and and yeah it just overall worked as well as we say it does um so starting in October we started testing this filter now beforehand I was using the very standard um kind of blue ones that go in line with the hoses and I really didn't think much of it other than I like I think I need a filter um and as we started to learn more and more about water it was really how A great water filter can really keep you safe and certain places and really make the difference um the early versions didn't they had what they thought were good quick connects but they didn't even connect to Gard hoses they were the wrong size um they didn't come with hoses at all and now we've got hoses that you know different options and lengths and all kinds of cool stuff um and so yeah it was just and it was a 3D printed much bigger than even it was a two- filter and this is the three filter is bigger than this one um so it's just it's come down in size the easability of use has gone up um the durability gone up the old one the whole the whole housing was 3D printed it was pretty cool um but it would crack if you leave it out in the sun too long because the UV would degrade the plastic and then it would start clacking along the 3D prined lines um so they you know through all of that we have helped them kind of come up better designs um better usability so um yeah that's just kind of the story so from October 21 of 2021 yeah okay so you know that's that's a great intro to to our relationship with blue Technologies and their philosophy of really wanting to get the product right I think is is the biggest thing there um I think we you know like any product we we don't dismiss things we want to work with the manufacturers to improve those products and make sure that and we give a lot of feedback to to our partners you know whether that be peplink or parek or pointing or blue or I mean yeah literally yeah exactly they they all of them listen to us because we get so much feedback from their customer base which are actual rvers um yeah let's let's take a step back for a second and and set the stage for why this is so important for people in other words I mean you know when you're living in an RV you like talk a little bit about where you get water from as an example yeah yeah absolutely I mean so our our personal journey is I mean we are traveling about two to four times a month so about we stay two weeks to a week in places and you know the water is always a question is it from the well is it from a city is it from a Reservoir in your body you don't really necessarily always know your water source and the Water Source can change property to property when we were in Traverse City Eric had a complet completely different water source than I did I was one block over on a well and they were on City water so even then you don't necessarily know um and we've even heard stories of people that that are employees that have gone to places in their RV and the city had a water issue where they were on a boil notice they didn't even know that pulling in because they they're not like on the local um you know texting for Safety and Security Network so they didn't even know they needed to be boiling their water um that was coming into RV which you thought would have been fresh coming out of your spets um so you don't necessarily always know your water and and you also want to protect your investment of your R&V I mean your RV can be a very big investment for a lot of people so to just throw in water that could be full of bacteria viruses and germs that can linger even past where I'm staying so if I fill up my tank with bad water or all of that bad water gets into my pipes you know it's hard to flush it out in a lot of cases um so from that aspect you know just having clean water water all the time that you know is clean because you've cleaned it can really make a big difference and just knowing that you have good water regardless of what you've plugged into and and I think a lot of and you know until I started to dive into this this sort of area you know I don't think I live in an apartment you know I turn on the water and and the water comes out it tastes okay it's clear sure but there's a lot of things that can be in water that just because it looks clean and clear the best example I can think of is you know all of those sort of wilderness shows from like the late 90s and early 2000s where they'd like you know send somebody off into the woods and they have off yeah EXA like Bear Grills exactly you know and they would talk about like here's this beautiful mountain stream and you know we're all taught from marketing speak that that must be the cleanest water because it's in the middle of nowhere and that might not even be the case yeah no I I I went through a big naked and afraid like series or I watched that for a couple month yeah they always were getting sick from the water that was the thing that would take them down yeah there's you because animals will do what animals do in or near water and that can not necessarily be shown um in the clarity and can definitely cause issues so having a good filter and not just having a filter you've got to have a filter that can do the job correctly and that can be a challenge there's a very popular product um called a berky in the travel space it's a big clear big silver stainless steel canister um that will filter out everything it's a purifier there's different levels and that hits the purification level um but you can't necessarily live with that because it takes an hour to filter a gallon of water right so although it's taking everything out um and it's great for drinking water it's you can't necessarily cook with all that all the time because if it takes an hour to to do a gallon it just just takes a long time right but you can take then stream water planing process to make pasta you know I love mac and cheese and that that makes this 12 minute process a lot slower yeah but that's taking out and purification is taking out 99.99999% of everything in your water um you know so you can you can go to the the river pour it into your berky and get clear water out of it that was the idea um yeah yeah so now the stuff with blue if we want to dive into some some details these are 0.2 Micron filters there's three them so your your safety filter takes you down to 0.2 um and that will that will filter out your bacteria that will filter out your viruses um but also leave in minerals that are good for your water and the minerals it takes out the tasty filter um is what's putting them back in so like a car a carbon and other stuff that makes your water tastes full and round and not like distilled water um so that's what these filters have focused on what blue and Corbin and his team have focused on is making sure that you can run water through these systems and get your get a very very good filtration so that your entire RV is has clean water in it regardless if you're in a shower and you accidentally get water in your mouth um while you're in the shower you still need to have clean water when you're going through the shower um you still need to have clean water when you're cleaning your dishes if you have viruses and bacteria going um through your RV and your clean your dishes now they're on your dishes they're not necessarily clean so not just for drinking water but you really want clean water to live with and that's what these create yep yep uh what I'm gonna do is see if I can put you sort of Center Stage here so that you can we give you a little wider camera angle sure yeah yeah we got some fun stuff to show here there we go look at that I'm learning how to use the software sweet um so I'm going to be off camera for for once uh you know and I'm going to let you sort of talk about the product line of that that blue has so I have because I I think that's I think that's a pretty big concern for a lot of people is you know which one do I buy what kind of RV do I have does this work with me you know does it work for my needs you know let's give a real overview kind of give yeah absolutely so I I'm sitting next to my RV I'll move my camera a bit so this is my fifth Rel here kind of see it blurred in the background I'm sitting at our picnic table here thanks to the beautiful Serene fall day actually I'm in the middle of a cord New York middle of nowhere and it's just you know the leaves are starting to change it's just cool enough where I don't need a jacket but I probably should have one it's lovely um but I've got a lot of demo product here so I kind of wanted to go over some high level stuff talk about the brand um talk about some of its key features a lot of questions we get all the time and if you have questions throughout this whole thing please put them in the comments whether you're on Facebook or on YouTube we'll see them and then we'll answer them as we go through um and if it's kind of unrelated I'll answer them at the end we'll kind of circle back so definitely ask your questions happy to go through so blue technology we'll talk about kind of their Core Concepts overall so this is going to be an example of one of their filter sets um I'm gonna turn off the B I was gonna say yeah maybe turn off the camera blur so that yeah yeah let me know if that doesn't help we know you're in a pretty place anyway so it's okay so this is going to be this is the MR3 um this is a a three stage filter um and it has three kind of main Concepts to it mine I will say it's in the wrong order because this is an older version um but your first one is going to be a longevity filter that's very similar to the campground filters used to in line it is a 10 Micron um filter that's pulling out dirt and sand it's helping the other filters last longer so it's kind of a sacrificial filter taking up some of the big particles um so that the other filters work less hard but they focus on what they're focused on um the next one in the lineup it says tasty here but it's actually going to be the safety filter and that is your 02 micron filter so we've taken all the sand and dirt and now we've taken out everything else um down to bacteria level and virus level and then the last one in the set is taste and that one focuses on making sure your water smells and tastes good kind of targeting chlorine a bit um it's using a carbon coconut um infused kind of filter so it's it's not it's it's making sure your water smells and tastes good it's taking out the rest of that stuff um for you so those are the three main filters now each of these I'm going to flip my unit over and actually open it so you can see some of these um they're a 5 inch filter set so they're very small compa you may want to tilt your camera down just a hair just so we can or back it up a little bit if you can there we go perfect it's on the edge so yeah so we'll just take this one off I you can't see the bottom I'll give just a second um each of these are a little different um so um they all have their own purpose purpose um and so can can you put the filters in the wrong order I mean you can't you can't put them in any order and they've actually updated this since then so it's actually really nice but this is going to be a HED um safety filter so it's normally Pure White and then as I use it and collect water you know it will change colors what the new systems have that's great is each of these labels here come with a color um so there's yellow green and white um so you will see the color here and then the filter the white one goes with the white label the green one goes with the green label and the yellow one goes with the yellow label it's very very easy to know which one to put it in um now that they've updated these tags I guess I should get an updated system so I can show that but these are the sides of the filters I mean my hand is is you know average size they're a 5- inch filter overall um and they're very easy to change you saw I could just do this here at the table by un twisting everything and kind of pulling it out um the inside of the canister is like up underneath they're all stainless steel canisters so that you can put them in a dishwasher if you have one or they're easy to hand wash in your sink um and then just replace it you would just basically put this over and then you put the canister right on top and screws down and so the filter changes take seconds to do um overall U but the whole thing is stainless steel all of the plumbing is food grade uh materials um all most of the parts all the parts that can be stainless steel are stainless steel and then you just have the minimal amount of plastic for the housings itself um to make those a little bit lighter and then this is all stainless steel as well um so the whole system is not that heavy it's much lighter than all of the competitive units um and it's very easy to store this whole thing I mean fits really nicely into my relatively small storage Bay um next to my water cabin so again this is going to be the MR3 that's our most popular system we do have an R2 which is going to be two filters is going to be your safety and your taste filter um and so if you wanted to just do a two and really the housing doesn't change sizes all that much so you're not saving that much space and that's why we like going with the three get the longevity um and then now you have kind of your best setup here regardless of what your water system is overall now with these housings yeah go ahead I just I just want to stop you for one sec just just just to clarify that so you have a longevity filter that's sort of think of it like a macro filter it's going to take out the larger particulate that might be water then you're going to get into the the next one would be the 2 Micron that's the one that's really or safety filter right that's the one that's really um taking out anything you couldn't see that that could get you so to speak and then finally the tasty filter isn't really a filter so much as it's adding mineral the the proper minerals to make it taste good back into the water is is that exactly it's also pulling out a couple things um like a chlorine stuff that isn't going to smell great so it's a little bit of countering of uh pulling out a little a little bit of things that the safety filter isn't necessarily focused on chemically you know um but this would be your taste filter um so you've got your I don't know if it's the right way how the screen always does it but your longevity is here your safety and then your taste um which just kind of what you're looking at from a filter kind of standpoint yeah so if your water sore is on I'm going to guess your right side there yeah starts on this side yeah so water's going to come in from there go through the ma the macro or longevity filter first then the safety sl.2 micron filter and then finally the tasy filter and then it connects basically into your water system right directly yes so there's there's what it comes with if there's an option in the bundle it'll come with this but you can't just get the filter and then these separately it will come with a 5- foot hose um which is this braided stainless seel hose um and then this goes it connects directly to trying not to get water on my computer so you've got this quick connect here at the end um and they just snap on and then there'll be a quick connect tip that you put directly into your existing RV um Water Bay and so then In Your Water Bay it just snaps right in just as it easy was on this side it's the same ending um so that's that's the next part of this is the quick connects so I'm going to take my filters out so it don't fall but if I turn this over so you see the quick connects on the screen the whole system is based on yeah so if I just turn it so that that's one side of it where that's the small side the hose has the same and then they just quick connect so you quick connect all the way through now there we have options here so if you just wanted to just get the housing it will come with the bits so you can use an existing hose if you already have an existing hose you want the Quick Connect that's fine will come with a set so this ending will be here you connect your Zer G hose or whatever you've got to it you can do that right into your system you are going to need a 5 foot or three foot or something to get this into your RV so a five foot hose is a great option it's already got the quick connects plus you get another set of quick connects which you the hoses which is nice um so depending on how you want to do it the bundles will come with a 50 or a 25 ft hose option depending on your setup how long you are typically you need it um the 255 is good in most places so if you have a spare hose and you're just you just kind of want typically your 25 foot hose I do the RV the campground spet and then I go right into um the hose will go right into the filter and then the filter goes into the RV so it's and everything is Quicken it so it's just you know it's so easy to set everything up all the time it it doesn't take any time the only time I'm ever twisting water onto a particular thing is to SP it itself and then everything is Quick Connect all the way out so that's what makes this super easy now the next version if you want to add to this which I can tell you in this particular location has been amazingly helpful is a water softener so the water softener from Blue is still heav because I still have water in it is still going to be stainless steel so you still get this really nice full kind of canister stainless steel look um and you get the quick connects from all of it so so so let's talk just just for a second there let's talk about what hard versus soft water is for for anyone isn't let me see if I can set this next so you can see it yeah so it's all about the minerals that are in the water hard water is typically got some version of metal in it in a lot of cases um could be Iron um could be other composits um so the softener I am not smart enough to walk through all the different details of the chemical level that the softeners working um we were working on a video to kind of better explain this but there is an ion exchange that happens that um involves like sodium with salt that you get from salt um and then as the hard water passes through it those materials will stick to the resin and the salt mixture inside the softener and it then basically removes it so what then um you get out of it is basically the hard water the hard materials in the water removed and you get nice what feels like soft water the benefit of that is if you have a lot of water spots on your shower doors or when you're doing the dishes around the sink if you just see water as it dries it leaves spots that's from the hard water or the hard minerals in the water um so the softener removes a lot of that so it can help your clothes feel softer it can help your shower um not have the residue that builds up like on the curtain or the glass doors um and then anywhere you use water in General it just won't build up and leave that residue behind well and I you know I think I I lived in one place that had really hard water a good example of you know trying to show what that feels like is you go to lather up soap and soap just doesn't lather right or you know it it makes it really really really difficult from that standpoint yeah I lived in Texas that had hard water and you couldn't run the dishwasher without spots being left like your dishes never felt clean um it just felt like it was always something on it so same thing it it definitely is or your shower nozzle gets clogged up with all of that mineral sort of coming through eventually and or your coffee maker doesn't work very well after a while I've killed a couple coffee makers that way pretty pretty easily and we all know how much I like coffee um yeah so I mean that's that's a big that's a big issue so so basically coming out of the final filter you would go before it goes into your RV you're then adding the water softener into that is that how that works yeah you're adding a step so coming out of your taste filter which would be the last one you can then quick connect it directly into your softener and then you would take another five foot hose and then you would go SL camera then you would go from the softener right inside to the RV got it got it so it's just another leg and it's optional you don't have to set it up every time um I have been to campgrounds that will have a built-in softener so the whole Campground is on soft water you don't necessarily need to run your own yeah like I Hur anything um but yeah so it just kind of depends you don't it's just an option now in your in your setup um the software itself is also quite small I mean if you're going to compare it to other ones that are on the market um yeah this one's not that big it's a 10,000 Grain water software um and when you drain the water you know the water is going to be a lot of the weight so I don't travel with it full of water you just tilt it over and drain it out each time um but then yeah you can depending on your place I throw mine in the back of the truck just because it's easier for my setup I don't have a big Bay tall enough uh and it's it's traveled well back there and um the expected use before you need to recharge it with um basically a can of table salt depends on where you are so the life and the durability of these things are great the only thing it ever needs in its lifetime is to be recharged with um an EP like a just regular table salt one I forget the name of that brand Mo mtin mtin you know the one with a little Rainbow or the umbrella um Morton and Morton thank you Morton salt so I just buy that at the store it's like a dollar and then once a month I'll recharge it and the recharge we have a full video on it but you basically rinse it out you fill it with salt you mix it up um you let it sit then you rinse it out for a couple minutes and then it's done and then you have nice soft water again so it's very easy to maintain you just have to remember to do it Eric never remembers that's the trick he's got um and but I me there's no maintenance cost to it you don't have to replace the resin you don't have to do that it's um the resin's I think good for five to 10 years it's like a crazy long life cycle as long as you keep it charged um really from and just to sort of pick up on that point from before the resin is bonding with the salt to create a chemical reaction that's basically removes that hard water from the water as it's flowing right neither one of just just as a disclaimer neither one of us are biologists or chemist or any yeah anything in between so you know sorry but um yeah and that's why you have to recharge it because basically the in that absorption process you can you can be fully absorbed this can absorb everything I can um and so back flush yeah yeah exactly so between a back flush and an assault that basically recharges the resin that's what keeps the resin allowing it to react with the hard water so it really can depend on where you are as far as frequency I'm up in the Northeast I'm on it doesn't feel like well water it actually smells like chlorine a little bit um so I think it's some version of a a city water system I'm it's not that hard coming out so we're not you know so the water sof we're having in place but it's not doing that much we were in Arizona where the water will leave like red dashes down the sides of your um shower drains um I was having to recharge it every two weeks like we were we were flying through it um we were in um Michigan and I was on a well that's just the softener right though talking about not talking the filter was clean the filters were coming out clean but I was just getting hard water coming through it um and but the Michigan was actually my biggest test because we were on a well and it smelled like iron like it smelled like someone was bleeding as you were doing the dishes it was just this wreaking iron smell I put this in I made sure it was charged and it went away completely so it was pulling out that heavy iron smell but didn't now I didn't feel like I was on well water I felt like I was on regular water um because this was taking out everything that you know their filter wasn't catching at the campground and then this was taking out the iron um so it made a huge difference for us in that spot okay looks like we got some questions Dave is there anything I was I was just gonna do I was gonna so so Dennis here talks about the fact that he has the the two canister per Mount version um I'm going to show I'm just going to display his question on on the camera here Dennis thank you for joining us by the way and thank you for the question um that's an interest and by the way thank you for being from New Hampshire I am a fellow New Hampshire right that's how we call ourselves um uh the first I live in New Hampshire and cold water makes the stainless sweat gets my bay wet is there any kind of insulator things to put around the canister to prevent that or any recommendation you might have for that um yeah I've seen that too mine's outside so I haven't necessarily stressed about it but I understand and I see that a lot especially when it's really cold water coming through um and it's warmer outside I've seen I've seen even the water softener um have condensation on it I will ask if there's any sleeves for these I haven't seen them yet um uh it's all going to be around temperature so if it's warm inside your Bay and you're running cold water through it I can see that being an issue um I will have to follow up so Dennis shoot us a um like an email and say you had this question on the live stream so we can follow up with you on that um but I will ask blue if they have any suggestions see if we can get you um I'm gonna put that on the ticker I put our email on the ticker real quick just so that that people can see that per uh in case they have questions our our whole support staff is there standing by to help you guys um the second part is uh he was having a hard time getting the canisters to see to seal and then now he's ready to go winterize his camper and he can't get the canister off but he's also sort of as a second part of that he was saying that the um he's he I guess there's a tool that comes with the the kit but yeah it seems like I think he's concerned it might break so you know do you have any do you have any suggestions there or yeah I mean you don't want to force anything because that can definitely um cause issues I know so the tool he's talking about um fits into these here so when these are up and they've spun them tight sometimes you need the tool to kind of break the seal um I'm seeing on there he's got a rivet or something he mentioned so I don't know if he's riveted close or I'm not sure uh yeah it sounds like he he was worri basically he in he permanently mounted it and then it yeah that by by nature of putting too much force on it you know yeah um I mean when these are inside basically your housing down here Le if you can move the tool I've had to use some leverage especially when it got cold so these would sit here and then you've got your ring and it goes over it and this is what keeps it kind of all together I've definitely had some get really sticky on here um I I think what I've had to do and I know his his is a little different this a flush or like a mounted solution so you want to have the cage that this one is in um but yeah if you can try and get your tool in there and just just enough to break the seal without breaking like your connections because your connections are going to be hardwired in with like pecs if it's really hard and you've tried all that you're like I don't know I would just uninstall it I would try and remove the PC and see if you can wiggle it out of where it's where it is um like pop it off and that way you can turn the unit on its side get better leverage um as long as you're using the tool and not twisting it in any way it's not meant to be twisted it should come undone but really when we're the idea we have when putting these on there is going to be you're kind of see here these are the Seals that keep this um to keep it watertight once you've secured it once you put these necks all the way up as far as you can from a hand tightness I try it hand tight and see if that's good enough when I turn my water back on if I I'm still seeing a leak I will take the tool and then just go another like if if here's a DOT so I will take it almost another eighth not even a full quarter and it's usually tight enough to make sure that seal is fully engaged um you shouldn't have any leaks after that it shouldn't take um you know a big army musclean to kind of get these to be sealed um water seals in general should just be get it tight with your hands and then just a little bit more should Engage The Rubber enough to have if it's not ceiling after that we can we have replacement seals so we can just so reach out to us and we can make sure your seals are good or take a picture of that in the snow you might just need a different seal one other thought I was just thinking of Dennis too is um you know you talking about cold water getting the whole system cold things shrink when they're cold you might try just using like a hair dryer to warm up that collar that might get it that might get it enough to help you break the seal especially as it starts to get cooler so yeah i' say running hot water through too but that's I know that's hard because it's inside plumbing and your water source is probably cold water anyways yeah yeah yeah but yeah couple ideas there um you know in in terms of uh sort of your experience on the road and and going all the different places that you've been you know have you run into any situation so so obviously you were rving before you had these products right yeah you know what did your RV come with any kind of filtration system do RV in general come come it's very it's very brand specific your question so I am in a keystone um and they do not have inline filters whatsoever um if you do have an inline filter it's typically in your webay and it'll be a 10in column where you can similar to these where you just kind of you untwist the bottom uh you'll typically have like a big plastic wrench that you need um and that will untwist the filter and it's going to be this big 10-inch filter that you can buy there's lots of different brands that have them um if you've got one built in that's what it's going to be and it's typically In Your Water Bay we see that in a lot of class A's you know Grand Design does that a lot um it'll it'll just it'll greatly differ by by brand if you have one built in um and those filters can be fun you really need to see what filters in it a lot of times they will just be a five Micron or a 10 micron filter that are just filtering out sand that's all they're really going to do they're not going to do much else um if you have that we have a option where you can get the safety filter in a 10in version um so if you don't want to if you don't need the whole system or you already have one there you can get a 10-inch version of this 0.2 micron filter from us and put it in that particular setup now the drawback from that is you're still only at one filter doing nothing to 0.2 microns so that could get clogged up really fast and then if you reach out to us and say you're having flow issues we're going to tell you check your filter did you clog it um because you're going you're not you're taking out your longevity filter so you don't have anything kind of pre-filtering and then you're going straight to your point 2 Micron and it's now doing everything it could get clogged really fast if you're on a dirty water um kind of setup so in those cases um Eric has s in his RV he has taken out his 10-inch filter altoe um and just does one of these three stage filters because having a third one every time you go through a filter you're giving up flow rate um this is considered a high flow rate system so you're still going to get three gallons a minute of flow through these three filters but if you add another filter through it you're adding more work for the water pressure to be working through uh so you could start seeing degrades in pressure if you add just ridiculous amount of filters um over and over and over again so it's important to kind of have like this the right primary amount of filters this three setup is good if you had just this it's possible it will work you're just going to clog a lot faster because you're asking this to do stand sand dirt all the way down to 02 microns it's just got a lot of work to do it's going to take it longer um so just something to kind of think about so you could have filters built in you could not when we started we did like I said the ones that came in line with the hose and those are 10 Micron filters in most cases then I I I was like I think I want something a little better this is full-time like we're doing a lot of water here I want to make sure we're safe we upgraded to one and it was a five micron filter yes that's better but it's still not taking out stuff that you are concerned about if you had wildfires in the area that's still going to get into the water and still go through a five micron filter um so going to something that is like this this virus bacteria level um protection was really what you want to do well and and it's interesting because Roger Fritz just brought up an interesting point and a distinction that I think it's important to talk about um I'll show his question here but you know when we talk about 0 2 Micron or 0.5 Micron and stuff like that we're talking about stuff that's suspended in the water right versus hard water is things that are things that are dissolved in the water so that they're like they're chemically part of the water versus something that's just suspended in it right you're talking about atoms level of size yeah so that's that's yeah I mean that's a great question because that was one I had in my head each mineral you have to look at kind of at that chemist level of how big is this mineral what are we looking at specifically this isn't going to take out everything we never said it would it's going to take out things though that are important that it focuses on um so if you do have hard water minerals in your water like iron iron is smaller than 0.2 that's why it floats through um so you have to hit it at the ion level which is what the softener designed for so and you really it's important to filter your water first and then go to the softener you'll see a lot of Campground um or RVs at the campground they'll just have a softener that's okay except now you put in unknown stuff into your softener that might you know not let the softener work so well so yep yeah you g be putting sand and dirt in here right because you're going right you're going right from the spet with a 10 micron filter right into here so you could be filtering and and really putting a lot of stuff in your resin you don't want in there so having a going through a really high-end filter when right your softener you know your softener is well protected and going to be doing well y absolutely um let's talk a little bit about uh you know warranties and stuff like that how does that work with with these products because that's always a concern for people buying anything from anyone which yeah totally fair and you're on online you don't know what you're going to get so um we have a 30-day warranty on all the products and it's important I say it's 30 days from the time it ships so we really want you guys opening the box as soon as you get it running checking your seals making sure it looks good um making sure you don't have any issues checking your filters right away if you have any issues like let's say you turned on the water and you noticed any leaks now I'll get to that in a second but let's say you found some issue reaching out to us in the first 30 days is important just so we know what the system is and um we can do that and then we there is a warranty on all of that um I will say though each and every housing that comes out of blue that we ship has been pressure tested before shipping out so and they do that from a QA standpoint so this is not going to be some system where we're like oh we're getting a huge return rate I mean Dave you do the returns are we at like less than 2% total and that's even if people don't like it or people ordered it the wrong thing I mean so there's a lot of reasons people could return we just we don't see that many returns on these because they are tested before they go out um we know they're pressure tested um you know we're shipping everything so we know they're packaged well um we've worked really hard to make sure there's no issues in front of that and blue works really hard too to make sure there's there's not but if you do have anything that's missing um or you do have an issue which I was very rare uh we do have 30 days of a warranty on this now I will say if you if you did use it this is like a consumable product to some degree um so if it's six months and you change your mind you've used it we we don't take stuff back like that because you've used the water you've used the filters we can't we don't necessarily know where it's been um so it's important in that first 30 days it's tested you guys know it's going to work for you um and that's that's done sooner than later um on these okay that's great fantastic well I mean is there anything else there that we should talk about like uh you know what about the filters expensive you know yeah we can talk filters so I wanted to show well talk about fil so filters are not that expensive in the realm of what filters can cost these are $55 for the set of three um to replace and again the replacement is once a season if you're traveling seasonly or three to four months is kind of the average we're seeing overall um but I did want to talk quickly about changing your filters because there's a quick set uh like tip I wanted to share I do it upside down so as I'm putting these in um you'll see there's the circles on actual canisters themselves and each of them will have a seal on the top all of them will have some version of a seal I find it easier to just make sure you set the you can put it on specifically exactly how you want it and if you do it upside down you're not trying to like set it in the canister and hop it in make sure it fits right so I just do everything upside down and you might get wet a little bit so just do it on a pcking table like gu you don't really care about where the water goes and then you can the canisters right on top you can make sure everything threads in perfectly and that is the easiest way to change your filters as you go through got it got it and that way you know that Rubber seal is also engaged because you can you can literally feel the canister sit onto it yeah that's a great tip so that is that is the tip there um yeah so I'll mess with this later but that is the that is a general idea for the filters so that's a really easy way to change it um I have two different units I wanted to share one is a cool one that if you're in if you're if you're ever going off grid a lot and you're finding you need to get water to your RV like we were just in a national forest um and there was no there's no water hookups so you had to like go to a water fill station and they don't have like a hose spicup it's like really just fill up a bucket of water and take back to your site so that might that might make it a little challenging if you don't have right connection little challenging especially when I was trying to get like 90 gallons and put it in my tank for a week but what what blue has um is this off grid solution so it comes in this really cool bag and then this is all designed um to basically have a self contained filter set and a pump got of the bag you can use it in the bags I don't always take it out but um so this is going to be the MRX plus that's this particular model the MRX plus so you've got your safety filter you've got a pump and then you have a taste filter um same filters are used to this one's actually a little bit upgraded from an off-grade 0.2 Micron and then it has basically a place you plug in a battery that comes with it and you can pump water from a stream from a lake from anywhere that you feel is relatively clean water you're now filtering that water um and putting it where you want so it just connects the is the siphon hose side of it so it goes right into the Quick Connect here and then um you drop this in you've got a little thing to keep it floating then you use your other hose you can use a 25ft hose you can use the 5 foot hose whatever whatever fits your fancy and then you can put that water where you want it so in my case I filled up a bucket that was next to the spet and then as that bucket was filling up we then siphoned it directly into the RV and was able to get about 70 gallons in 15 minutes um to kind of stay for the stay for the three or four days we needed that much water for but along those same lines if you were boondocking right I mean you could at that point you're saying you could essentially get um water from a stream right water from a stream so this is down to that 0.2 Micron just as we were talking about like be Grill is hiking through you know whatever Wilderness he's in I mean this filter is designed to pull water from those questionable sources filter it give you clean water and allow you to put it where you need it is it going into a camper van is it going into a bladder is it going directly into your tank um you can pick and choose basically choose your adventure kind of choose where your water's going to go um and you just have a lot of flexibility with this um the battery here this is this is a very standard um 12volt plug I'm forgetting the name I think it's a UAE plug Source um it comes with one that works off the moroi batteries the you the little 12vt ones um I have this adapter I've gotten on just other equipment that works for like RI batteries or all kinds of different 12vt sources so if depending on your 12vt Source you've got you can be very flexible here's a car um a cigarette adapter that kind of goes into the same plug so you can get as long as you can get 12 volts to this thing you can pump water anywhere um which makes it very very um uh Universal you can fible yeah mhm so this one that's pretty slick now this model just discontinued for the only sake of the body format they changed it they made a little bit lighter made a little bit sleeker um so if you're seeing one on our site it's going to be the AR ARX um model same thing it's just going to be a lighter frame which is great they've done some improvements based on because this one's heavier than the three phase because the motor there's just a lot more to it um so if it's a little different this this is same insides same filters and actually they've moved to stainless steel filters over the plastic ones so a lot of good upgrades to it but same concept same C connects same battery same it's so great overall that's part of the changes we've made um if you have an existing filter in your RV this would be the wrench you might be used to to change those um so just just to stop you there for a second so you're saying the MRX is discontinu the one you're showing there but the updated version of that's now called the ARX X ARX M so there's the ARX plus that's going to be the one that comes with a battery then there's the ARX that will not have battery but it's the same thing it's just whether you want a battery included or not is really what that comes down to um but it's the same filter same filter set overall same um you know siphon hoses and quick connects everything else would be the same okay okay very cool very cool uh is there is there anything else we want to cover in terms prod yeah I I have an early look um this was just announced at the Hershey RV Show by Blue um it's the next version of filters and it actually hits the level of purification with these so this will look very similar to what you just saw this is this is the I don't even know the name of it yet because we haven't even gotten that far in the marketing aspect of it but it looks almost identical to my Mr the MR3 right so this is that that metal one um I had before but now you're going to see longevity you're going to see off- grid and now there's this this mystery Circle one yeah no name no name and this focuses the final stage is a UV filter um it requires a small little 12volt power source I stole power off of a cargo lamp um inside my storage Bay so very little power um and it only takes power when you have flow going through it so there's a little flow meter on here as soon as there's flow this will be red as long as there's power it turns green when there's flow and it's on and now you're still getting your longevity you're getting your off-grid filters that's your 0.2 Micron um and it's even better than that because they're also using some um Electro um Electro something with metal that they're pulling some of the harder Metals into this filter and collection it that way and thenis something like that I got to get the naming from we are not scientist people I'm sorry yeah we're sales guys you know yeah but then at the end of it it goes through a UV purification so anything that makes it past this ridiculous filter already is then Zapped completely um through a UV filter so this brings it down to a level of what they can call purification um and that's what we were talking about before is like a 99.999 that's what your purification levels are at so now your water coming through has been UV filtered and now UV filter in water um for RVs is not new but it's usually at a level that can only do drinking water so it's like another filter that sits under your sink um you've had to run power underneath your sink in your RV and there'll be another little like water spet where you can just turn on to get drinking water that's already out there in the RV space a lot of people might be familiar with this is going to be for your entire RV so now we're talking about your showers are clean your dishes everything that you go through is is done through the UV uh and it just takes very very minimal power um through 12 volt um which you already have it's all three RV already so it's really easy to wire up we will do a lot more on this I just want to do an early look in this um uh on this call because we can and that's what this call is all about but yeah this we've we've had a uh we we've had a long string when I say long string this is the fifth show um uh that uh you know what sorry just I don't mean to stter here for a second but when you search ARX on mobilus have.com we're not uh Mark I yeah we just are getting them in so I'll talk to our web our web uh person to make sure that they're loaded but I know the MRX was discontinued and they're just now releasing the ARX so like we're in the middle of this transition I think yeah we lost Andy there for a second you back can hear me now yep there we go right yeah um we are in the middle I think that was that was brand new information for me this week the ARX so I think we're in the middle of getting that up on the site um so if you check back with us uh tonight or tomorrow we can make sure that listing gets posted for you um if that's something you're interested in um I know they they ship very similar to where our warehouse is so we can get them in very quickly and I know we've already ordered some um so we'll get more more in got it okay so Mark sorry about that but we'll uh if you email us at info@ mobile must have uh we'll let you we can let you know as soon as they're available sure please shoot us an email we'll send you the link as soon as it's up yep or live chat with us on the store any of the normal ways be and then just this is so new I don't I don't have a release date on this like I said I don't even have a name um but this is kind of proof that we are testing things before we ship them so I've been testing this for about a month now as how I've been putting water through it I've had great results um the thing we've been making sure is consistent is flow rate and taste overall um as we move to different water sources um so we've been very happy with it the performance of power I've been I haven't even noticed how much power it's taking even when I'm trying to test it so the power draw is very very minimal um and yeah so it's just kind of an example of us in the middle of testing something that's not quite out yet that we're really excited about bringing to the market um as soon as we can but yeah so something in the process so so just to pars out a little bit you're giving up the tasty filter but in exchange for essentially a higher level of water purification to get to the point of purified water there there is more I can't say on all the filter technology in that one that's fair that will be released as that filter comes closer to Market um but no the short answer is no the TC filter is not necessarily sacrificed um it's just uh displ differently okay okay um so Mark just just to address that part the the UV filter that's a product that's still in development um so it's not that that specific model is not available yet it's just something that uh Andy who is our grand wizard of product testing and product feedback along with everything else um is uh you know I think we're going to give you a t-shirt that dis says Andy the guinea pig because you know everything's tested yeah everything we test everything I mean we test lik it then it then it gets get gets added to the store and you know yeah yeah it's like the old life serial commercial right if Mikey likes it I'm probably the only one enough to remember that commercial but that's okay but you know cool yeah now now I as we're ending we are on the final hours of our Prime sale which means we have all of our water products 10% off um and it ends in hours so if that's something you're interested in or looking at it's the best sale we've had all year on water I don't even know if Black Friday will be as good as this is um uh so it's 10% off water now if you are a member and looking at a bundle of our um which includes hoses and I'll tell you what a bundle is a bundle is going to be a splitter at the spet and that's the only thing you're ever going to twist on then the splitter will connect to a a high flow pressure regulator okay then the regulator connects directly to a 25t hose like the one we've been seen it's all this um metal uh wired hose similar to this um then it's going to connect directly into your MR3 which is this one now the bundles there's one with and without the softener so you can pick which which bundle you want then there'll be if there's a no softener one 5ft hose if there is a softener you have two 5 foot hoses um and then all the quick connects that go right into it you actually end up with a couple extra sets of quick connects so you can use it with garden hoses and or um like like spray on spets or everything you want to use with your water you'll have enough connections for it um anyone who M with standard Garden host fittings will tell you that those quick connects might be worth the the whole bundle yes yeah and if you're familiar with quick connects I had my huge reservations for them in the beginning I had gone through so many different ones on Amazon they kept leaking over 3 months or so they only have so much of a lifespan I am on the same set of quick connects for the last two years I'm waiting for them to fail because I I want to know how long they're going to last so the original set of quick connects I was using from my Beta system I still have in play and they've been working flawlessly um throughout so it is a really good system to have here is kind of the system as I put it back together um and the quick connects are just just makes setup so easy um I even have my kid do it most of the time now because he can't even mess up with leaks you know as long as it's clicked in you know you're not going to have any leaks to it overall so that's good great system kid kid Murphy tested approved as well so that's that's that's impressive in of itself um very cool well is is there any are there any other uh parting comments anything else coming up that we want to talk about uh we are not going to be live next week because our our fearless leader Eric is going to be hosting hosting the uh mobile internet Resource Center webinar next week um but uh uh you know we will be back the week after that and um you know we will uh we will see you soon up we got one more here Purdue guy and lb if filtering into the fresh tank before boondocking do you recommend we condition it still H that's a good question um so when you first I'm reading this in two different ways so if you first get the system we do recommend flushing your filters in general um you want to get water in them you just kind of want you don't want just any particles to the hoses and all that stuff you just you do want to do a general flush that's the same for any hose not just these um or any filters so after you do your filter flush and that is just running water through it um for a couple minutes something nothing drastic um I put anytime water is touching my RV it goes through this system I don't care if it's on City connection I don't care if I'm putting water into my fresh tank everything goes through here I know on my unit behind me I have two ways of putting water in the fresh tank if I'm on City I have a valve I can change to say fill tank I don't change anything other than flip the valve and all of a sudden it's diverted with all the plumbing behind the scenes to fill in the tank so of course it's going to be going through um through the filter system the second way I can do it is just through a gravity feed where I've got like a little door on the side right above my tank I can drop water in I will disconnect this from the RV I will connect it to um and then I'll just move the filter right underneath and I'll just hold the hose right into the fresh waterer kind of drop system and so that way even all water hitting the fresh tank is um clean and that does help your fresh tank stay cleaner for longer without any milde or any of those issues because you're not you're not putting any of that in so it has a harder time growing overall you have to have a clean tank to start with if you already have a dirty tank that's a different problem um but this would keep you from not having longer term problems overall because you're putting really clean water in yeah it's going to preserve it's going to extend the lifetime of that tank if nothing else I've been on some older sailboats and and um that have not have the nicest water tanks made for made for an interesting interesting trip for sure so very cool well uh if there's nothing else yeah so I'm gonna say uh thank you for joining us this week I know you're incredibly busy especially with uh as Eric talked about here in the chat uh pep Link's got some new models coming out soon um we just announced them on the mobile internet Resource Center if you want to go over and read about it there but there are on our store as well y on our store available for pre-order yeah I think some are due in tomorrow even so they might be shipping out as soon as Monday which would be awesome if that's something do yeah not not that we could ever stop talking about the internet a little bit but you know so important that's how I'm staying connected here that's how I'm doing this call over water exactly exactly cool well awesome well thank you so much for uh for joining us today and uh like I said we will be off next week and then we'll be back the week after and we'll we'll post the time and and all that so you guys can join so thank you very much and applaud to the great host we had here today thank you Dave great questions thank you thank you very much all right we'll uh we'll talk to everyone soon have a great one bye guys see you on the road", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2023-10-13T09:06:43Z", "channelId": "UCE9KnGK2TcpXLlIi5cQfGvg", "title": "Fireside Chat:

{"id": "Jy9DTw7ZLdA", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "rb8Vs2yfIqfVK4Gt9hBdjJVJzw4", "transcript": "the next big thing in portable water filtration and softening is here come along with us and I'll tell you all about it and there's some special discounts [Music] too so yeah it's been about two years since this uh prototype unit actually of what became the R2 model blue water filtration system uh hit our bench and we started testing now Corbin and his team of engineers in cumman zo Michigan from Blue technology have been hard at work they've been taking our feedback and information that we've been giving about these systems for years and theyve just continually keep improving the systems so we wanted to tell you a little bit more about them now before we get started if you're watching this video right when it came out we have a prime sales event going on right now which gets you 10% off our all of our water systems so make sure you check that out now if you missed the sale I highly recommend you check out our memberships at membership. mobilus have.com which gets you discounts on everything in the store every day of the year and that's a good way to save on stuff like this so why do I like these systems so much well first and foremost I like that they're small and that they're portable I also like that they're made of 304 grade stainless seel which is safe for drinking water use there's a lot of weird Metals out there a lot of weird Plastics out there and the fact that Corbin and his team have gone with stainless steel just shows how much they're committed to Quality when I talk about size this is a good example so this is their water softening system my previous water softener was not only thicker in diameter but about that tall and it doesn't sound like that should make a huge difference but at least for me in my Integra coach it meant that I couldn't slide in and out my slide trays underneath without completely removing all the water and tipping it on its side with this unit at least on this bus I can actually slide my trays in and out because of how much shorter it is and it doesn't really stop there with the softener although that is awesome that it's so small if you look at the filters themselves and you look at some competitors that do three-stage water filter systems they clock in at around 28 to 30 lb and this guy this is the MR3 is less than half that like 13 14 lbs it's so much lighter and just in terms of Everyday Use smaller in my opinion is better as long as you're not sacrificing flow rate or filtration and with these systems you're not before I get into filters and stuff like that cuz that's obviously really important I want to talk about the Quick Connect system here that you see here now every single bluex system uses these quick connects and they are not like any Quick Connect you've ever seen on the market I have not had a single Quick Connect failure in my two plus years in terms of any leaks whatsoever and I can't say that about any Quick Connect I've ever used especially ones that are like those big box stores made out of plastic or even certain ones that are made out of metal that you see on Amazon that say that they're for pressure washer systems I've ordered them I've checked they're not the same these are patented from bluek they are absolutely bulletproof you could just tell and picking them up they are made to last forever my team makes fun of me at trade shows for how much I talk about the quick releases but living on the road is just a GameChanger and a timesaver and I love them so much the fact that they've got a male and a female end means that you can't hook them up backwards and all of the accessories come with the quick connects so if I'm hooking up say for example this this is one of those sprayers that they have boom I'm good to go and I'm off to the races the Splitters use them the pressure regulators the pressure valves all use them which is really just awesome all of the filters accessories and softeners come with those quick connects but they also include additional sets when you pick up a kit so that you can add them to your drinking water hoses that you already have if you're interested in going full stainless steel you can check out the stainless steel hoses that are available as well with the quick connects pre installed I love these hoses they pack up super super small and they're just really easy to store while also maintaining great flow rates and just being a great all-around hose so let's talk about water filtration right here I've got an MR3 system which is a 3 stage water filtration system at the beginning here and it's pretty cool that they're all colorcoded this was something that we requested and uh they they delivered just to help folks we've actually colorcoded stickers on the front of these systems now and they correspond with the filter so you can't really mix anything up if you kind of get confused and you're not sure what order they're in but starting here this is essentially a sediment filter this is going to get rid of sand and everything big and they call it the longevity filter because it's going to extend the life of your additional filters we start there we get out all the big stuff and we sort of prefilter the system then we move on to our 0.2 micron filter 0.2 microns is very small it's filtering out viruses bacteria volatile organic compounds all that scary dangerous stuff that can be inside of your water 0.2 microns is the latest technology and it's doing an absolutely amazing job at filtering the really really tiny stuff to give you an idea 0.2 well if you went to a big box store and you see those like inline filtration systems those are typically 20 or 30 microns let's give them the b in for the doubt and say 20 this is 100 times the filtration in terms of the amount of how much smaller it is and how much more it's going to catch it's a big big difference next we have our tasty filter this is an activated carbon filter that's going to help with things like chlorine hydrogen sulfides that like rotten egg smell things like that this is going to help improve the taste of your water so these filters are small but are they Mighty probably the number one question we get is how often do I have to change these filters so that's obviously going to highly depend on how much you're using the system system and what kind of Quality Water you have at your disposal at each location but a general good rule of thumb is if you're a really heavy water user you're going to change these out about every 3 months and if you're kind of a more typical full-time user you're going to change them out every six months if you're a seasonal camper you're going to change them out once a season now that we know these filters last a long time what about flow rate well these guys are rated for three plus gallons per minute so that's really more than your RV can handle your typical showers in the one to two territory and I've had absolutely no problems with pressure even with that 0.2 Micron filtration they figured out how to get high flow rate along with exceptional filtration into a compact housing that's the secret sauce of blue let's talk form factors for a second so these are fixed installation options these are designed to be installed inside of your water Bay you've got those in single and triple filtration models and word on the street is there's a dual model coming as well if you want dual filtration um just gives you a little bit bit more of a portable space and a really nice high gloss stainless look here um great for uh if you've got a space where you want to install this inside of the vehicle then you've got your portable systems this is the MRX and um that is going to be in a triple form factor there's new models coming out all the time so you can check it out but essentially these are designed as portable systems to be outside of the vehicle you can mount them inside there's actually screw holes back here to mount it inside if you kind of bought this and then decided you want to do a fix mount installation but typically these are a little better for fix Mount just because you have easier access to the filters for changing them than you do with something like this that has a foot designed to sit out on the ground next you've got some 3D printed models and uh there's various models you might see the RX series and what a lot of those mean is that they actually have a pump installed in the middle and possibly even a battery now these are for off-grid filtration uh use cases so if you're staying in campgrounds and you're plugging into pressurized water systems where you turn on the to and the water comes out you don't necessarily need to worry about these if you're going way off grid and you want to pull water out of a stream or a lake or something that's not brackish you know you don't you can't pull salt water through these um then the uh the off-grid systems are for you and they often times will come in a 3D printed form factor um while we're uh releasing new features and trying out new things on the line once you know we kind of understand what the market is looking for and they they've kind of figured out that there's a mass production value you'll see things like the ARX which has just come out which is an off-grade filter system in a metal housing so it's really just a form factor preference I can tell you the 3D printed or the metal are great I have them both uh it really just depends on making sure you get the right features for your application so you filtered through all this water what the heck is this thing and why do you need it well this is a water softener and water filters cannot soften water it's a different technology this is really working kind of on the pH level of your water but let's talk about hard water uh it's been around forever and a lot of folks know what it is because they experience it in their day-to-day life at home and on the road if you wash your dishes and you see all these white spots on it you know you got the soap off that's typically hard water and what you're dealing with there is calcium and magnesium mostly that's dissolved kind of at the ionic level into the water creating a hard water situation water softeners use sodium ions and they exchange the ions with the magnesium and the calcium and they make the water softer that's how the technology Works blue didn't come up with this technology you're not you know trying something experimental this is what's in water softeners in your homes and has been around this technology has been around for a very long time what blue has done is they've made it into an exceptionally attractive and high performance form factor here uh in this this portable stainless steel system that works great with the Quick Connect systems so what you get here is exceptional filtration and then you can plug right into softening and now you've filtered and softened your water for the ideal perfect water solution last let's talk about accessories just look at that that is the nicest looking stainless steel pressure regulator I've ever seen and it's branded blue they they're really proud of this guy it works exceptionally well to protect your system from over pressure events you've also got a gug gaug here pressure gauge you can put this in line anywhere so you can test the different um pressure between you know pre- filter after filter to make sure that you're not losing any pressure um nice little thing there and uh beautiful Splitters here that go this is what I put right on the spigot uh this is a two-way splitter they've also just come out with a really cool looking three-way um that we'll make sure to put on the site as well two or three and then the sprayer is awesome uh blue has been uh listening to us for quite a while on these accessories so we've got some cool stuff maybe right angles and a few other things coming out soon but the point being that they're standing behind this for customers and making sure that as your system grows your accessories can grow with you and you'll always be covered and protected on the road thanks so much for watching guys and listening to me talk about our Blu Tech water filtration systems again I've had these myself personally tested for two plus years I love these systems and I love that they're made in America if you're watching this video again right around the release of the video we have our Prime sales

months and the guy didn't move it so 50 RVs in that Park were flipped over and this Beast survived it so wow that's pretty Co I my my brother had a tree fall on his uh Toyota uh Tundra pickup truck and the insurance company's like yeah we don't total to you the pickup trucks so sorry but we're going to fix it exactly yeah we seen Top Gear where they drop it off the top of a yeah that was exact yeah that was exactly what I told him too I was like you know so well welcome everyone do we yeah we have people watching already this is great um the uh the topic of this week is going to be how much data do you really need and this week we actually have two guests we have Eric our fearless leader and founder and then we have Andy who is our everything else on the store um my name Dave I am the head of special projects and welcome to the live stream so the question really comes down to what are the key factors that people should consider when they're trying to figure out how much data they're going to use and I think the best part best way to do this is I want to get two perspectives one from Eric who has you know a a wife that works and he works full-time from the road and then from Andy who not only has two working people in the on the road but also two Teena one teenager and one almost teenager on the road um and probably consumes more data than Eric and I combined which does wouldn't surprise me in any sense of the word yeah sounds that's also why I'm on mute because we have background noise so so Andy just give me the high sign when you think you have a quiet moment and we'll we'll we'll come back to you but you're good you're good Eric you know what what are the factors that people should consider when when they're trying to figure out how much data they use yeah so I mean I think you've got a couple different things right if if you are riant on your internet connection for your TV which is becoming more and more popular um I cancelled our uh satellite television dish or you know whatever one you have about two years into getting on the road so around 2017 and we hopped into the uh the Youtube uh TV streaming concept so this idea that I could pay at the time 45 bucks I think it's now 65 bucks and get access to all my local or all of my live TV channels and have it on my phone have it in my RV have it in my house it was completely location independent as long as that location had internet uh so I didn't have all these cable bills all over the place when I parked the RV maybe I went somewhere else I didn't have to pay a satellite bill I was like oh this is cool um so that jacked up my uh my band my my need for more um more capacity on the uh the internet side I think things um Zoom live streams work stuff like that became more and more predominant in like the 2018s and on so we started seeing that and it uses kind of a comparable amount of data to what you'd see a TV show using so maybe it's three four megabits um and I know you know we can geek out at this but I I think we just wrote a really cool and detailed blog post that gives folks a lot of the data of like how much data is watching TV at X you know resolution for an hour download so we won't kind of totally geek into that but we'll link that and that gives people a lot of cheat sheet notes to to know I'll go I'll post that now in chat let me grab the link but yeah I'll post that for people well also we can also link it in on afterwards for the live stream on on YouTube as a pin comment and on I assume we can do the same thing on Facebook but um yeah I think that's you know you're your your standard browsing you're kind of hanging out you're checking email most of that stuff doesn't use up a lot of data um if you're cautious uh with your devices and you turn off automatic updates they don't tend to use a lot of data but keep in mind if your devices just see Wi-Fi and they connect to a peplink or any device they're going to just assume they're on an unlimited internet connection so you know your Mojave blah blah blah Apple update is 10 gigs so you could be surprised when that downloads in the middle of the night another one that has that takes people a little bit for a loop is like online backup software I see a lot of people uh you know enable one drive or Carbonite or some type of cloud-based backup solution and just say yeah back it all up it backs up 300 gigs of a hard drive um and byebye data plan yeah I think that's really why people uh learn to appreciate a more advanced mobile router solution because you can see that stuff happening and set up alerts and know what's going on before the big one we've had is um is game updates like platform updates for uh Nintendo switch stuff like that where games have had 10 gigabyte updates or I know Xbox has had crazy high ones from what I've heard of so that could be another big Zone 100 100 gigs per update pretty pretty sign and then any game is between 50 and 150 gig depending on the game so um yeah and and Raymond jeel had a good desri good suggestion here which is starlink you could you could use some of the outbound policy tools to to direct some of the traffic where you know maybe you don't you don't care about yeah so there's there's a little Easter egg in today's fireside chat there's actually a firmware release coming out in it's in beta right now so you could test it and play around with it in beta and you can just Google search peplink beta firmware and you'll find uh where you can download betas but firmware 8.4 is officially dropping uh in a couple days I don't know if I'm allowed to talk about the permanent release date but it's inside of a week and uh one of the interesting new Advanced features that that will come with is some more uh Advanced abilities to tweak your outbound policies and okay one thing you can do is you can tell it um not only to use like a least used connection but you can specify upload or download so that can really kind of help you improve either your download or your upload speed if you can set up those policies more effectively an example like starlink oftentimes really does struggle with upload like it just doesn't have a lot of upload and if you can tell the outbound policy hey use my I least Ed Cellular Connection for primary upload it will it will automatically do that and you may significantly improve your upload speed while maintaining a good solid download speed using that Starling connection so some fun little Easter eggs there but you know going back to like the topic so I have a property here in New Hampshire with a public Wi-Fi system that's feeding right now probably like uh probably three or four families um in total and I just looked at our usage and we're at about two terabytes uh 1. n34 terabytes in a 30-day period um so that would be considered like some like like a lot of people just absolutely crushing it and trying to use the internet effectively like home internet um my average traveling working heavily and leaving the TV on way too much in the background 800 gigs uh is kind of my like that's my number I seem to when I am not at all thinking about the internet I'm using 800 gigs when I'm turning off the TV trying not to leave stuff streaming all the time worried about a data cap something like that 3 400 um and if I removed live TV from that and and it would go way down so yeah there's and I would assume that's also including you know doing a lot of the video production stuff you do with us in terms of uploading videos and stuff like that too is that part of that page or absolutely there's so much work rated content that's going on and I'm a bit silly I've got security cameras in my RV that are pumping up to a DVR 247 so that's definitely not helping and um I think uh I think there's quite a bit there but you know I mean so we have thousands and thousands of customers on our on our on our data plans that are available on our website and with our 300 gig plans a handful of people hit those caps every month like three or four so I think the vast majority of people are are are under 300 gigs and and anyone who's serious about about Mobility is typically traveling with more than one connection so they are definitely uh able to stack those gigs across different plans yeah I mean I think a lot of people do travel with more than know I'm just laughing at the cat now we know this is live by the way um in the making of This live stream I'm actively looking at my usage based on Eric's comments and so we're at like last month I don't know we did something crazy I was at three terabytes so something terab yeah I think I was doing a lot of video work um you know for upload Minecraft it's probably aoup Minecraft updates the same I've never seen three terabytes usually it's around 1.3 1.2 terabytes um but we're streaming TV Disney plus is crazy I mean it's on all the time there's five people here so so um there's just a lot of data flowing through it plus I do a lot of the channel work here um Eric I sharing footage like crazy so there's just a lot and that's going through a lot of different channels I've got I've got starlink so that's including starlink in that that's including data plans um Wi-Fi I mean that's that's all of my usage Al together yeah um kind ofed in and you're you Andy are are full-time in your RV at this point again now right yeah we travel basically once a week on the weekends to new places to kind of explore um and then yeah we've been fulltime since 2018 in the RV wow that's that's amazing um now you you talk about three terabytes across all the data plans can you talk about sort of the data plans that you're running on a on a day-to-day basis yeah um so Eric and I are testing some stuff so data plans are kind of Shifting around a lot which is fun to talk about but primary plans is going to be a the p1000 um so it's a T-Mobile 5G compatible plan um that's a terabyte basically amount of data and then avilable mobile.com available yeah right off of our site and then um the second primary one is typically a AT&T um 300 gig plan um so and then starlink so I have a terabyte on starlink a terabyte on T-Mobile and then um AT&T and then some test plans kind of come in and out depending on what we're looking at um another little Easter egg for folks on the live stream our p1000 plan we we advertise it at a thousand gigs it it's it's essentially an unlimited plan there are no caps at the top we just don't like to use the word unlimited someone plugs it into a server and does a 100 terabytes we get a call gonna get that's going to get capped yeah yeah it's unimited it's not going to it's not a throttle or anything it's really an arbitrary number we came up with that we feel is more than enough for for most people well and so Raymond asked a question kind of similar to this like the will pepling toggle back and forth between starlink um and data plans to maintain connection so the answer roughly is yes there well does yeah let me let me let me because we get this this is like a number one question about pings yeah so whenever you reach out to the Internet it's called a session so you're establishing a connection with someone else you're talking to could be a website could be a zoom could be a TV show could be Netflix you're establishing a session now a pink device before you establish the session it'll look at all of the online available connections and it will pick one based on whatever policies you've set the default policy is pick whichever one is the fastest mean meaning latency or kind of like the snappiness of the connection and it'll grab it and it'll run a session down that tunnel now if you have another computer on the same network or another device or your phone or whatever and you go create another session like I want to go out this other thing it will run that same thing again but it make it a different answer the second time when it goes because that first connection's being used when it goes who's the fastest response the peplink may come back and sayit starlink that second session will go out starlink that technology is called load balancing and it is enabled by default on all peplink devices without any special setup or configuration so that kind of tells you how that works now to take it to the next level is where you call is something called bonding which is where you connect all the connections together speed Fusion is what the uh technology is called for peplink that's what they patented it under it's called speed Fusion connect protect is the official current name of that and what that's doing is it's saying don't worry about checking all these just Bond them together into one connection and use them all at the same time and that's an oversimplification but we have so much content on speed Fusion connect protect and uh for folks that are intimidated by that peplink has gotten to the point where you can set that up and configure it in under five Mouse clicks so it is very easy and fast to configure but it's not for every type of traffic so you you typically set them up uh in both ways and we have a speed Fusion guide that explains how we recommend customers set up their networks one Wi-Fi network works the first way with load balancing and one Wi-Fi network works the second way with speed fusion and then you simply connect to whichever Wi-Fi you want depending on what you're going to do with that device good example would be there's no reason to bond all your connections together to watch Netflix um it wouldn't actually even work because Netflix would see that bonded connection and think you were trying to watch TV from outside the United States or outside of your geographic location and it might pop up an error um but even without that there's just no point um you'd really just typically want to stream over your fastest connection it'll it'll it'll uh work better to be honest so most people have those two Wi-Fi networks and just use the bonded one for stuff like this for when you're on a work call or you have something where you really need the connection to be super reliable but um that's a good good way to put it and to to Raymond's followup um could starlink be one of those networks absolutely anything could be one of those networks you could put cable modem into it you could plug starlink into it you could plug a T-Mobile home little box those are popular into it yeah you could technically connect to an external Campground Wi-Fi and that would be a Wan Source that's the beauty of the peplink devices it doesn't care it goes hey whatever you give me as an internet source I'm G to then work Downstream to optimize combine load balance whatever whatever you can think of yep yep no that's cell modems two three four 12 yeah however many we have we want to geek out for a session I'm sure Andy could share his current dashboard and show how many connections he's got online right now one of them being Starling yeah exactly yeah let me see if I can do that with this program but I'll trans set that up yeah yeah well we another little another little Easter egg on that just before you wrap up 8.4 that firmware coming out officially has starlink native support in that 8.4 firmware so what that means is you can actually monitor the starlink from the in control 2 Cloud management system in peplink now and you'll get a little starlink logo technically you can even Stow your dish from the starlink web page um but I would caution you not to do that because if that's your only connection and you Stow the dish you're You're Now offline and the website that stowed it cannot get to the peplink anymore to unstow it so um but more specifically what's interesting is a lot of the statistical data about starlink the performance obstructions views all that stuff is now available in in control so it's um starlink and peplink have a have a growing partnership and they seem to like playing with each other uh based on how they're helping each other um I think starlink is very excited about um Pink's ability to help them with some upload bandwidth to keep their Network healthy and their customers happy by augment offloading some traffic to Cellular and to other connections and Pink's very happy because starlink allows their device to be even better than ever because it's another thing you can plug into yep yep that's that's that's really great info uh Raymond had one follow-up question Andy you know what what what kind of starlink unit are you running and I think Eric you can answer that question too but yeah I'm running the high performance flat Mount um I you can go on our YouTube channel and see the install video of How It's installed right on the roof um one of the key there's a lot of key benefits to the flat Mount one but the main one I like the most is I don't ever have to set it up so it's always on it's always working I don't have to do a pole or suction cups or run cables and wires when I get there I I park and I don't even check the internet anymore it just works and that's through four three layers of cure and and starlink they're always on never think about it and and you don't have to sew it anymore when you go to drive right it's just fixed so they did make a big change from when we when I installed it um that was when I when they first came out with this when it was on the in motion kind of plan so if you got this particular Hardware it worked while you were driving um now they've moved that to be based on what plan you're purchased um so I do not have the inmotion plan I don't need I don't I just use cellier while I'm driving I don't need starlink um so it only works when I'm driving less than 10 miles an hour but I can always instantly upgrade to the uh inmotion version if I need it with that well if the 10 m an hour Limits The Limit that's perfect for sailing because uh that's about as fast as s but well it's very yeah long you're not in the ocean it'll work yeah they did it for inter Coastal you know just putting along y um yeah so yeah those the fix Mount dish is expensive 2500 bucks it's a hit you know people feel it I can tell you after having both of them it's night in day I mean really the it's it's double the surface area it's higher powered they call it a high performance dish for a reason it outperforms my standard square dishy hands down it it does really well in just faster speed but it also does well in like partial obstruction where the other dish just struggles if you've got like that one bunch of trees that just kill the thing uh the fix Mount has kicked but and done better but um I'm not knocking you know the standard dish the you know $500 price point killer um I'm actually going to be installing the standard dish on my um my my travel trailer which is sort of like our secondary trade show trailer um and doing an install so you could see the fixed Mount and you can see that one and I'm going to do a really cool like special install so that it vastly simplifies the whole wiring problem that everybody has okay wow that's that's a that's coming subscribe to the YouTube channel you'll see that video and I think there's some stuff that we're doing that not a lot of people have have put out there that uh can improve your Starling setup yeah and I think I mean that original the original dish and then the dishy which is is probably what the Gen 2 starlink I've I've almost lost track I think they call I think they call it the starlink Rome now okay that's the that's the dishy and then the the uh high performance fix Mount is what they call the the one that's essentially double the size for RV and a lot of people are putting them on Marine as well yeah but but I mean the original sort of dish on a stand wasn't really designed for Mobile use or anything like that it was really designed to to to live in to be provide internet to somewhere that wouldn't otherwise have access to maybe cable or DSL right yeah rural Home Solution essentially yeah um but uh people have have figured out a lot of cool ways to customize it there's a there's a pretty large contingent of people that are taking uh dremels to the back of them and cutting out the foot and turning or converting them obviously avoiding your warranty into fix Mount dishes um but uh pretty solid results with that um not something that I would rely on as my only internet connection but absolutely part of the Arsenal yep y i I think that's that's that's great information um one of the questions that I think people run into a lot is like let's say you're headed to a new location how do you evaluate which carriers are going to work there if if any and and what do you do in those situations you you two you two are Road Warrior veterans at this point in terms of going to lots of places some of it is history but I mean I've been saying this for a while but starlink is a 5050 shot for me in most places and it's almost always because of tree cover it used to be because of coverage issues with the lack of satellites they've they've done a really good job to make that better but now it's just there's a lot of trees in campgrounds you know you go out west it gets better um but uh but in terms of of uh cellular networks I mean Andy do you have a Magic Bullet answer for that I don't feel I do I I I have a process um so we travel once a week on Sundays so the answer has drastically changed from 2018 to today um it also has changed because I have a roof antenna installed so I think the the biggest part of my answer here is it entirely depends on what you have if you have something like our bundles with a Parc antenna you care a whole lot less because you're going to get signal in so many more places but when I first left and before we did like our big internet upgrades I absolutely careed um what I would do you know if you're on very minimal setups is you have to go to like campendium and you have to look up basically where you're trying to go and see if there is cell signal there's a really cool app called coverage made by our friends at um mobile internet Resource Center um that basically overlays all the carriers covers Maps together so you can see on one one place all the different coverage um great app for highlevel summaries not very good if you're like does this exact Campground have coverage because sometimes it's just not it's based on what the carriers say not based on like what users are reporting um there's also open signal which is an app that will tell you based on what your user saying but the problem is that it's going to be phone based typically not necessarily hotspot based so you might get signal there but it doesn't mean it's going to be usable or fast or workable as I'll say it like uh a great example is we had an affiliate just roll into Thousand Trails Orlando anybody's ever been there they know that that you you have Bermuda Triangle you'll have four bars of coverage at that particular Campground the coverage is not the problem but the towers then are saturated and really really slow so that I have more often than a coverage problem I normally always have bars it's then how good is the connection when I get somewhere um and for this affiliate they were running T-Mobile home and AT&T and a pep wave and AT&T was getting three down and wouldn't register an upload speed and T-Mobile home wouldn't connect at all it just said no service even though there was full bars um we basically turned on a T-Mobile plan for them remotely um they were able to get 30 Megs down because they were able to get to a different tower that was outside of this Orlando Circle um because they had a big antenna and it was they could get to another tower that wasn't saturated sitting inside Orlando so then they were able to work she was a our affilia was able to continue working and doing their consulting job that they get paid to do so we were able to yeah I'll kind of say there's yeah there's two there's two sides to it one is I'm spoiled I have all three cellular carriers in starlink my peplink device when I get to a location checks the latency of each connection and anything that's over 250 milliseconds of latency it just throws in the garbage it goes don't even use it and I don't I don't do any of this it's all done automatically in the device and then so that's why I don't ever really go in and set it if starling's under a tree guess what latency is super high disregards it turns it off I don't have to turn on or turn off anything just works um that's part one of the answer if you've got multiple data plans yeah and connection options in your budget and that's what I would say for folks is that's why you want a multi- connection strategy now on the cell carriers after being out there and in the wild I would say that T-Mobile has the most consistent high speeds I'm seeing nationally Verizon is getting darn fast and they are they are they're coming after uh T-mobile with some of their cand stuff and what they're doing I'm getting insane Verizon speeds um like when we had Mike wendland's in uh in Indiana starlink was at 180 and barizon was at 300 and we were like cool um so and then AT&T is like consistently average that's what I call it it's never fast but it's kind of everywhere um when I if I could have just picked one plan in 2022 I might have picked AT&T um it doesn't seem to ever be over 20 25 megabits it's just like that's all the network had but it was kind of everywhere um what I really liked about and and then the one is Verizon if you ever go to rallies you ever go to places where there's a lot of rvers Verizon sucks because everyone's got Verizon so the tower gets overloaded and it's destroyed everyone goes I've got full bars and nothing works I think that's getting better it's true it's still true and now T-Mobile is falling into that because of T-Mobile home everyone has one and so now T-Mobile is almost basically what Verizon was five years ago where because everyone's on T-Mobile now T-Mobile is just tanking when there's a lot of people around yeah and that T-Mobile is just it's interesting for 50 bucks you get basically unlimited who knows when they may start enforcing the fact that that's supposed to be at a home not driving around in an RV so that party I think might end at some point but yeah um one of the ways they're subsidizing a lot of the cost with T-Mobile is they're selling your data if you read the terms and conditions they say hey all your browsing data yeah we're we're going to go make money with that so is that that's interesting yeah but I love is we tend to find like two or three really interesting nuggets on these live streams and that that's that's a good one I'm testing right now uh I'm testing a T-Mobile home new 5G Gateway um and uh we're seeing some interesting stuff one thing that's interesting is how the speed tests work and what numbers I get versus go connect to a Microsoft server in a switch data center that I know I can download a 10 gig file from in three minutes and somehow I'm not getting the same speed download from that Microsoft server as I am from that speed test so I'm I'm digging into that a little bit more but there appears to be some creative routing going on that makes your speed test look really good but your actual speeds a little bit more throttled I don't know thrott the right word network managed Network yeah there you go but I think that's an interesting point too so we've used a couple terms today that I that I think I want to get you guys to expand on one is when we talk about speed there's the the megabits per second sort of number and then you've got a latency number can you sort of elaborate a little bit on why both of those numbers are important instead of you know one one or you know yeah so your speed is like your bandwidth right so that's like how much you can pull in a given amount of time down from the internet um your latency is more like for folks that are old and maybe actually remember what a landline phone was um if you ever made an international phone call you'd say hello and the person in England would say hello about six seconds later um that's latency okay so if you think about what it's like to have a conversation on delay we've all done it when we're on hold with Verizon or whoever and we're trying to get tech support and you can tell they're they're offshore and they're using a viip phone so there's like a delay that's latency and if two computers are talking to each other and they go hello can you and the other one goes hello and talks over the first one it creates a lot of problems for the internet so low latency is is how quickly you're effectively able to talk to the other party on the internet and then the bandwidth is more about how much speed you have between that connection and those two things are very important um but you know I I noticed I think Tim was asking the question about you know can I just have like three devices watching TV at the same time is this doable and that's an interesting question I mean I I think the average healthy connection to stream or do Zoom or do whatever needs about three to five on the high side megabits per second like that's what you need to watch Netflix in HD Netflix is really aggressive it'll go down to like 1.5 and work pretty well it it knows how to use crappy connections um the point being 25 megabits which you see on a lot of our entry-level data plans is more than enough for some somebody to have three devices working and doing what they need to do and one of the powerful things about peplink devices or possibly other routers but that's what we specialize in is the ability to set a bandwidth limit per device on that device so you say hey anybody who goes out to the internet can only use five and it's like it's setting up lanes for your devices so that when you go connect to Netflix it doesn't go oo this Starling connection's great I'm going to use 45 megabits to do ultra 4K video streaming which I don't think yeah I don't think you're gonna see a difference you're gonna chew through a ton of data for no reason if you are on a metered plan you're going to burn through a ton of it for no reason so the ability to set to lock your devices down to a much more manageable number like three or five megabits yeah per device so it'll stack on top of that is so key to to managing how much data you need on a monthly basis I will say from someone who has like five to seven devices online all the time that makes a huge difference because it just makes sure nothing is pounding and taking everything from it just makes everyone have an equal share um and so when you have a strong healthy connection you can then use five six devices at a time watching streaming this like I can tell you this is on I can hear a TV in there going and some tablet in another place going so you even even now we have you know I can even look at my usage but I I I probably oh something's uploading taking 60 Megs so that's helpful are they live streaming the cat that they were carrying around before probably I mean so yeah 60 megabits of upload is an insane amount of upload like that's yeah that's if we were talking about 1080p that's that's 10 televisions right now upload some some file is some yeah some video is yeah uploading that's why I I shut it I was able to find it so I turned that one off but yeah like I wasn't even looking at it you know and but that's the stuff that Eric you're talking about stuff can just sneak up and grab your data when you're not paying attention Y and and I think we have a lot of great strategy articles on support. mobilus have.com and then also with the mobile internet Resource Center you know they talk about sort of the more the nitty-gritty of how to really manage those those connections and get certain connections and limit connections and all of the other things that go with that right I mean yeah I mean if if you check if you anything we talk about conceptually here on the fireside chat if you go to mobile internet resource center and you know obviously grab a membership from mobilus have.com which gets you access plus gets you a big discounts on the hardware and then go up to the top and then go to resources and look at the peplink resource center and I've been curating for north of a year now with Christen Sheree um a lot of content everything bandwidth management Synergy mode in control everything that we talk about it's a big topic we not only go into it but we screen share the entire thing in a webinar and we show people how to do it so that you can not only kind of conceptually understand it but you can actually get a guide on how to do it interesting okay okay that's yeah and and you know Andy talked a little bit about how we solved um an influencer's Challenge and this is something that we're we're going to start seeing in the next couple couple weeks on the store um we're going to start releasing um what are called e plans so you know how we have the r plans which are Verizon the P plans which are T-Mobile and the B plans which are AT&T it's not rocket science B blue AT&T p pink T-Mobile that's that's all that is um we're releasing the e e like the concept there being it's a virtual plan and what that means is sorry yeah so we will start offering data plans that have more than one carrier attached to them so we have a data center as part of our launch I'll give folks a tour it's a real data center these aren't running in someone's basement and we have multiple Farms of SIM cards with data plans in them um of all of the different carriers and we'll be able to um when you purchase one data plan you'll be able to essentially ride on all three networks and it'll connect to whatever in that area um you know is is the most effective plan for you it's going to be a pretty interesting option for folks that don't necessarily want to spend money on just having all the plans all the time um now keep in mind you you get one connection to one carrier so if you wanted more than one connection but um but it's going to be an interesting thing and that uh the only caveat to that uh which we call remote Sim that's the technology peplink has set up um is you have to have a dual modem capable router so that's the transits the br2 the balance 20x those are some of the more popular units look in your yeah the ubr on your dash you'll see there's there's drop down SIM card a SIM card B and then there's one that says remote Sim sometimes it says Fusion Sim if you have one of the older firmwares that's the technology that allows it to go out to our Sim farm and grab a data PL okay okay and but do you do you also you you sort of have to have one local plan you that you can't really rely on just that plan right well yeah it's got to go out and get to the to the Sim it's not magic it needs it needs an internet connection of some sort could be anything I mean technically you could connect to the campground Wi-Fi once you're connected to the campground it'll go get the SIM via the campground Wi-Fi I wouldn't necessarily rely on that but you could pick up a inexpensive you know 10 gig Verizon plan that's on your phone plan for an extra 10 or 15 bucks a month and really all that plan is doing for you is allowing you to connect and then go get your other plans okay okay when do we have a a sort of launch date for for the E plans not trying to put you on the spot but I'm just I think I think people interested to hear that's all so it is tested and working one of the things I do not like about it right now is that our $30,000 Sim Farm it's not cheap Hardware uh technically if it went poof it would cause a lot of users to to go offline so we've invested in a another $30,000 Sim Farm painful uh but that allows me to have redundancy so if one needs to be in maintenance mode or has to go offline or something else it's not affecting our customers so that second device now that we're we're out of I'll call Alpha and going into beta is uh arriving next week and I'd really like to see this for November 1st okay all right we are actively taking beta customers right now so you can message um us at at info@ mob have.com and just say you know I I watch the fireside chat and want to look at the beta program for one of those data plans and um and we we can we can give some folks some Early Access we're looking for more testers very interesting huh um and then you know we we talk a lot about the plans that we sell through mobile must have but what happens if somebody wants to go direct to a carrier and get a data plan are they able to get similar data plans to what we sell or you know uh yes and no so um I mean you could do a Google Search and see unlimited anything data plans for Rural home or rvus for anywhere from 80 to $150 a month from a million companies um sadly a lot of those companies disappear when they have a problem and then they reappear with a different name shortly thereafter um and I a big part of the reason for that is because they're they're mostly selling tablet plans and they're basically kind of hotwiring them to run in routers and devices you know because they can get a tablet plan for 20 bucks that's technically unlimited um and then they can do some setting adjustments to a router and make it unlimited in a router carriers don't like that uh so when they do figure it out they you see these Mass shutdowns um quite a while ago I don't know two plus years ago um we really kept investing very heavily to uh to get data plans that are not like that their their business plans um our Verizon R series plan specifically authorized for resale authorized for what we're doing cost a bit more a lot more stable and you know we we we see lulls in our sales and then all of a sudden it's like three times a year we're like what is going on with data and it's just like 150 lines sign up in a month and we just start googling we're like who got shut down so yep um yeah so so to answer your question can people go out and get these plans yes typically you can get a similar plan but for the most part they are reserved for businesses so you need an EIN number um and you'd need to S sign up um for a business account and then you'd kind of need to navigate and figure out uh what plan would be best for you uh in that in that realm for something tells me in those situations are are you able to do month to month sort of the way we are or no they don't as long as you don't buy Hardware from them at the time of purchase there's not typically a contract um it's more just it's it's it's going to be postpaid so there's pro-rated charges and stuff like that but um you know you you can do it I think probably one of the hardest parts is if you go into a store they have no idea what they're talking about because those aren't really the business reps they look at a peplink or a router and they're like that's not authorized you're like here's the Verizon open development website that says it is they're like oh I've never seen that it's just a fight um so you know that's why at least for for this week and a little bit into next week we are um we're offering free a month of free data on any plan with any router purchase that just kind of gets people connected understanding how it can work and gives them some time to shop if they don't want to keep that plan and if they do want to keep it they can um one of the nice things at least T-Mobile and Verizon as of this year is they let us reuse SIM cards now so if a customer pauses their plan yeah they you used we used to have to ship new Sims all the time but now those two carriers have just said we're sick of siing Sims too so um we can turn on old Sims um typically as long as they were our original Sims we can turn them back on so you can pause your plan and then you know reconnect it later without having to have somebody mail you a new sim wherever you happen to be at the time yeah yeah I mean when you when you buy from us you get a free Sim so it's there but you can message into customer service service after that like hey I already have a SIM can you just activate this one and we can take care of it that's that's great we we like flexibility for sure yeah but this this uh remote Sim is gonna be cool because that's gonna like turn on a SIM card in a in in an hour instead of you know sorry cut support probably just backflip in four hours uh not four days because you're waiting for bail or whatever yeah we can do it same day which should be great um for the most part yeah I I did want to talk about because I know we're kind of getting close to the end of our time so we we have new plans two new plans we wanted to highlight um we kind of talked about it indirectly here but before if if youve been a customer we've had a a a high gigabyte T-Mobile plan and then we've had Verizon 300 gigabyte plans for a while we're very excited because we now have a 300 gigabyte AT&T plan so we officially can offer all carriers now which we're we're really thrilled about so depending on where you are or what tower you're closest to if some people are seasoned or something like that we do now officially have all carriers um there are two flavors of Verizon and T-Mobile so they're both they're all I'm sorry Verizon and AT&T have two different flavors um they're all 300 gigs but they the way those carriers are running their plans one is going to be a 25 megabyte throttle so you can only get 25 megabytes per second on like a speed test it's going to max out a 25 and then if you need it more than that you can go up to a 50 g that's the plus plants so there's the B300 or r300 for the 25 Megs um throttle and then there's the plus plants the B300 plus and the r300 plus if you want a 50 megabyte um throttle I tested the r300 at 25 and yes it does stop you at 25 but I was able to get four computers streaming 4K all at the same time so yeah and if you're augmenting it with starlink or any other connection it's like 25 megabits plus your other connection more than enough yeah yeah I mean I I have access to anything I want and I I will default to the 25 megabit because I just don't care like I don't need the you don't never hit that number yeah if it was my only connection it might be worth a few extra bucks you forgot the coolest plan I haven't forgotten I haven't gotten it yet so the coolest plan that we're very excited about is a r1000 plan which is for 5G motives so uh what this is It's a Verizon basically one terabyte plan the big disclaimer though is you got to have a 5G motive um it only works on 5G modems now it will it requires 5G to activate but it will work on 4G G if you go somewhere that doesn't have 5G but you still have to have a 5G modem so um just that is the big disclaimer for that plan but it is great so if you want if you really like Verizon Verizon is your network um and you need more than 300 gigs we now have a a basically a terabyte plan on Verizon and again that's a soft that's a soft cap there's no real cap on that plan it's just we set it at we set it at one terabyte to you know not use the the evil unlimited word but it is not a CPP plan soab it's not going to stop if you had like a br I know a lot of people went out and bought a br1 pro uh 5G unit so if you have that paired with starlink and you did like the r1000 that'd be two terabytes of data your disposal every month um kind of between those two plans you could also do um yeah lots of mixing and mingling so a couple other things I want to talk about on the data side so we've worked hard on um the store side because this is the side I work on every day of bringing in some new discounts so there's a couple ways to save with these plants um the first is if you are a member of mobile must have there's different tiers of membership but if you're an explor member which is by far most popular uh you will get $10 off per plan so um if a plan was like a $150 and you're a member you're only going to pay $140 um every month for that data so that can be um that can be big savings for you and that's it every every plan will get $10 off um if you have more than one now if you have more than one plan we're going to do a multi plan discount too which means every plan would get $10 off so even if you're not a member doesn't matter if you're a member or not if you have more than one plan each plan gets $10 off so if you have two plans you're saving 20 bucks three plans you're saving $30 now if you are a member and you have more than one plan it doubles so each plan will get $10 off for being a member and then each plan will get $10 off for having more than one so you can quickly start stacking 40 $50 worth of savings depending on how many plans you have yeah that's uh that's that's that's really nice I mean I think I think it's good to to reward that kind of loyalty to our to our customers for sure and if you do it this week you can get a free 30 days of data on one or two plans depending on how you well I guess probably one plan because it's one plan per Hardware purchase so unless you bought two Hardwares but um yeah so you can get 30 days of data and then you can stack discounts on top of that if depending on what kind of plans you've got or are looking to sign up so in other words just to clarify that the first data plan that you buy with your bundle comes at no cost for the first 30 days of service okay when Zero's out on the cart yeah so on a checkout it'll show you now you have to add it to the cart and once you get to the checkout screen it'll show it zeroed out okay yeah there something else you wanted to say there sorry I didn't I just think you know I as long as I can with confidence know it's not a tablet plan or some hot wired plan we offer price match guarantees so if you bring us a reputable website or competitor and say hey they have a plan that looks like your plan you know we obviously will match that and discounts will still apply I I think that's the that's a good sort of last question to to wrap up with what's our process in terms of when we launch a new plan how long do you guys typically test it for before you we put it out in the wild so to speak you know it's I it used to be six months it's probably three to four months because we're getting much better at it one of the things that we actually have now is we have we have kind of we have some people that work at the carriers that can help us now so we'll activate a plan that is told to us to be something and 80% of the time in testing and looking at the backend codes it's not what they tell us it is um I think this is what is responsible for a lot of those shutdowns we've also learned what to look for test and manage them quicker like even before we like we've just not even testing certain plans because we know to look for certain things or what's in the back end of we know that's not going to work because we've done that we've tried that it's you know we've already gone through the ringer with it so that's helped too if it's too if it sounds too good to be true and it's significantly farther apart than what the carriers charging probably is too good to be true probably not great it might work for a little while but uh you know as we saw with um with AT&T and certain Blacklist issues you know they're not necessarily messing around anymore so it's it's good to be on a legit plan that you know is designed to be on a router and typically if you see a carrier that's doing something like 300 gigs with this amount of fixed uh bandwidth that's telling you it's a router plan because they don't design those for tablets or phones they wouldn't even make sense for that so um so that kind of lets you know okay this is most likely a router plan that doesn't mean it's authorized for resale that's a whole another level of testing you have to do which is checking you know where we get these things and making sure they're through legitimate channels but um what's been great is that Verizon when they opened up that plan about a year ago for resale and I've gone all the way through the fraud departments to verify that um I had a little tiny phone plan that's under our our LLC with four four four lines on it and they found mobile must have shut down my phone lines I called them and I'm like what are you doing and they're like you're reselling I'm like under this authorized resale contract that is not the account you shut down they went sorry turned everything back on so we know you know we've we've gone through the ringer to to Super Fun by the way when your navigation and your RV stops working and your internet goes down and your phone what is going on um had this phone line with you for 18 years uh okay yeah but um but yeah we do a lot of vetting and testing to to to authorize that and with that Verizon plan we started to see a lot of folks open up and kind of match it if you look they look really similar and it's because they're competing y uh and I don't think starlink hurt anybody either I think starlink made the uh competitive landscape a little more interesting I know in 2019 2012 when we started man there was like a data drought it's just so hard to get anything good well I think some of that too was the idea that you know especially during the pandemic you had all of these people that used to go to a fixed place and have terrestrial Internet working from an office that we're now working remotely from pretty much anywhere and the networks just didn't have time to catch up to that in a lot of ways it sounds like I mean you know now we are here we are three years later you know almost coming up on four years later and and you know the Landscapes changed I mean one you have starlink that's giving you sort of additional it's taking a lot of the sort of Brunt off the top of it because eye usage people are probably going to use some starlink in those situations and then you carers have matured too I think they also saw how much money starink was getting for usage like that you know um but we're seeing we're seeing the starlink we're seeing the starlink kind of anger wave right now we're getting a lot of starlink customers that are like I don't like starlink and I'm like hold on I'm like st's great are you just trying to use it for zoom and they're like yeah I'm like it's not good for Zoom like it's not going to work for work but then we see a lot of retirees who are just trying to watch Netflix on it and they swear by it they're like this thing's awesome I'm like yeah it's what it's for it's like a high burstable download system that works really well but the two-way communication to a you know basketball floating in space is a little more complicated than people want it to be I'm on a zoom call right now with starlink and a DSL modem that's what I have bonded for this call you don't need a lot to make work but you just need that stable upload connection to balance them out and then it's an absolutely great product because there is zero selfs service where I am just doesn't doesn't exist so as evidenced by the fact that early on when we first started running this company you would go up to New Hampshire and we just wouldn't hear from you for a few days at a time I miss those days yeah it's it's a now it was great when Eric and I were both there that was that was when the real fun was happening no that was not fun because I was the only other person running the company and there was nobody else here but that that was not fun for anyone on this end of the call anyway but I remember I would have to run to the grocery store and that's where we'd be like messaging all of our I think at some point I texted Eric and was like Hey listen one of you better get back better come back into internet range or I'm not going to be here I think the line was I'm going to throw my laptop in the harbor so the pre the pre- starlink DSL only days yeah well you know at that it looks like we're up at an hour I want to thank everyone for joining and also remind everyone that um you can go to talk. mobilus have.com and schedule a consultation with one of our experts we want to talk to somebody about any of our Solutions uh they're they're there we

generation two really was ready rock and roll now we're starting to look at gen 3 and it's just awesome um I've been testing gen 3 now for two weeks or two months yeah that's great and it's just and we're all running on the exact same hoses the same fittings everything from two years ago uh I haven't had a single failure Andy has had one failure because he left a water softener out and froze sorry we haven't figured out the physics of that yet I wasn't I wasn't I didn't leave it out I was on vacation I wasn't home wor oh was remember that Texas ice storm yeah made for a good photograph gone we'll share that we'll share that next week but just yeah that'll be uh next week's topics water very good well thank you both for uh for joining me today and uh we will see you both next week

our our first real guest Mike wendland who is the host of the RV Lifestyle Channel on YouTube the RS rvlifestyle.com uh blog and website along with the RV podcast and prior to all that he was the Ho he was PC Mike on NBC TV if you if if you if you uh if you recognize them from there with over 20 Emmy Awards is that what I read 20 Awards all right it was close we're rounding up for you we're trying to make it who's counting who's counting well we're counting the future ones yeah exactly Mike welcome and thank you for joining us hey it's great to be with you guys so uh Mike you've been on the road for quite a while and and prior to the solution you were we we we're we're going to talk about here in a little bit you you had done some other sort of Internet gadgetry prior to uh to working with us what could you describe sort of what that was like and what you were using before and some of the challenges that that might have hit um yeah this is our 12th year uh doing the RV lifestyle traveling around the continent doing stories and sharing videos and podcasts and stuff and you know in that period of time I think I I used for the first couple of years uh just a MiFi data card from Verizon and then I kept running out of data as we began using it more and more and then I got two my five data cards from Verizon and then about a year or two after that I got two I had two data cards from Verizon and one data card from at T and then we started uh experimenting with uh some uh routers and that helped a little bit and up until the last uh almost three weeks now two or three weeks three weeks now uh we were using a um an older 4G pep wave router and uh a service that worked pretty good except for this part of it the upload part because of our our demands of sending high-end video files like just now I just sent several gigs through uh for a YouTube video that we're going to release on Saturday to uh to my editor and uh it would have taken me three hours to send those files and it was done here in about four minutes with the system that uh Eric uh and uh Andy from mobile must have installed on the roof of our Montana fifth wheel three weeks ago so we've kind of tried all sorts of them we've used tablets we've used our phone we've run out of data and um you know because many people have experiences as if you spend a lot of time on on the road and you really do need reliable internet we've had a lot of uh frustration and it's amazing I still have here because I was out of here yeah but we've now and we've had starlink uh for almost two years a year and a half now and they've had mixed luck with it the new system which I'm sure we'll talk about is a flat roof high efficiency permanent uh Mount but you can't really see it but it's right about there remember that Eric up there yeah oh yeah I know your roof like like I know my you know living room in my house hey I didn't I didn't tell you when you were installing that because you guys these guys were up there most of the afternoon I had a couple of other we were at a rally for owners of Montana fifth wheels and I had a couple of guys come up to me and they said listen we're really concerned he said that's a brand new RV you have what was wrong with your roof there's a lot of tools up there what were they doing yeah they thought it was some massive problem with it but yeah that's a warranty issue no no you're okay yes might be like I I genuinely somewhat take it personally when I hear that story on the internet because you were paying all of those different data bills because you needed to be connected and while you had a lot of different options to get out to the internet none of them worked together at the same time so you were always like I call it I call it hot spot roulette because you kind of just you you sort of dive into whatever one you're paying all the bills but they none of them work together so it's like it's start startling what's the one thing that I'm gonna most likely luckily get out of hot water with today and as a guy who does a lot of these live streams that's that can't be a fun pit in your stomach when you hope that T-Mobile or Verizon is the flavor of the day so to speak and point out you know our needs are certainly not that of the typical rver who wants good reliable internet they have trouble too finding it but mine are pretty intense we do a live uh stream every Sunday night with um you know well over a thousand uh simultaneous viewers and thousands more during the week and um you know we never know quite where we're going to be on Sunday and there's been times when we've gotten just started and I I don't have enough upload speed and it just dies and you know that's you you only have one chance if they're going to stick with you and if the signal dies they're gone and uh it was just so frustrating and uh we've done I think three since then and uh they've all worked just flawlessly as we are now we're using this new system to come to you right now I guess I could mess with you guys I could go you know I could do stuff like that it seems to be working if I start breaking up I'm using a traditional home internet connection right now so I'm not using the products that I recommend so sorry that's that's something I'm fixing in the studio as we speak but um but I I mean just to wreak our conversation I know you guys talked to a lot of people in the industry but it was you know appreciate the information but if this isn't gonna materially change my situation don't waste my time uh so to speak and and I was happy to to take you up on that bet and drive halfway across the country to prove what we can do and sounds like it's working out yeah where the the it has worked out really great and I I'm sure you can get into exactly what you did I I feel like I'm scooping myself here though because I do plan a full video on this for our people and I've been telling them for three weeks I got this great new solution but wait until I finish testing it and and now they're all going to know about it but uh don't worry we don't have any subscribers on this yet oh Well I'm good trust me this live stream is probably not going to be the the the dam that breaks that that news for you okay we're still leaving into this concept so so I think I think that's a great segue Eric do you want to talk about a little bit what the thought process was behind the solution you put together for Mike yeah so so Mike had a couple solid ingredients in his previous setup and to be honest um he purchases peplink from a competitor but I know that competitor they do a decent job um and I think he was somewhat of the way there meaning he had Reliable Hardware to connect out to the internet um and he had uh he had two data plans inside that so he had a cellular he had multiple Cellular Connections that you could use to get out to the internet um when we dove into the setup uh he also had a Verizon hotspot and uh I think the starlink had had kind of gone to the wayside at that point tried it didn't really didn't really give the reliability it just uh it if we were east of the Mississippi we found starlink did not perform nearly as well and we do a lot of boondocking uh it didn't do well with any kind of uh trees so I was a little skeptical of starlink when you told me that became the heart of this system but with that new larger antenna I'm giving the story away here before we get to it but I am I am like thrilled with Starling just thrilled with it and uh yeah it's it's been complete difference so yeah so we essentially unified this situation so what we have at the core of Mike's setup is what's called a br2 a peplink Max br2 mobile command center it's this thing and we'll show pictures of the install but essentially this is two 5G cellular internet connections that are out to the Internet carrier it doesn't matter what carrier you want to be on it'll take all the SIM cards T-Mobile Verizon ATT certified you could stick a Google fi Sim in there whatever you want to do it'll it'll typically work that's the the core uh system that we installed for Mike this is uh is it's a high-end product but the upload requirements that he had and the amount of data that he was passing was was substantially higher than the average rver and he needed time is money when you're uploading big files like that so that's at the core and then we supplemented that with the starlink fixed Mount uh high performance in motion kit which uh right out of the box without anything added integrates directly because it's a a professional grade device integrates right into the ethernet Wan port on this device and the peplink device then unifies or combines all of those connections into one single unified connection using the speed Fusion technology that is proprietary to peplink and we set up two wireless networks in Mike's RV so that he doesn't have to do the hot spot roulette anymore I was like are you having fun on your smart TV with that tiny little remote trying to Peck out your Wi-Fi password every time you switch from T-Mobile to and he's like yeah looked at me like you know about this and I'm like oh yeah I've lived this that's the worst thing about this whole situation every time you got to change you gotta hop to another Wi-Fi uh so we unified it up set up mic with two Wi-Fi networks one is a simple Network that will always essentially pick whatever is kind of the most responsive internet connection he has available at any given time he doesn't have to think about it the device is going to go and test the connections and he's going to use the one that I mean for the tech folks has the lowest latency that's how we set it up it's kind of this that's a good solid indicator of what one is probably the fastest um and then a second connection that has all the connections bonded together at all times so he knows if I just want to use one connection be the fastest connect to my regular RV lifestyle Wi-Fi if I'm working and it's live stream and I need all that redundancy I need my four-wheel drive I connect to my Fusion Network and that's it those are the two choices um and that's I think been working out pretty good the only phone call I got was uh you kept texting me speed tests at the middle of the night going this is awesome so that seems like it was pretty good it it really has been amazing I mean speed tests I know were you know you got to take all of them with a little bit in a great grain of salt but my workflow before when I would go live or if I needed to send some some big files would I'd log on and first of all see I'd go to speed test was Verizon better this time was a t better this time what was my speed if it was really low then I would end up trying to phone somebody up and say look I can't send these files there have been times that I I would be out in the middle of nowhere and I couldn't send the file and I'd have to drive into town in literally park next to a cell tower uh I've gone to libraries and used their warehouse and that's just not feasible for people working from the road so that's why I did so I've I've been doing these speed tests a couple of times a day just to see if this thing is it was if it's holding firm and consistently well over a hundred on um on uploads often over a hundred I mean on downloads and often over a hundred on downloads and uploads so 100 and 100 uh amazing I just checked just a few minutes before we went on now and I'm doing about 105 download and 60 upload and for reference I have found for a halfway decent quality video signal you really need to have at least five um Mbps I'm getting 60 right now and that's actually the slowest it's been but we're kind of prime time for a lot of people who are using the internet yeah and with this solution a speed test won't indicate the true reliability of the connection because I'm using more data because I'm duplicating packets across more than one connection to give you stability it's super technical but long story short I can't give you a super fast number and a speed test if I want you to have a really reliable connection because I'm sending the same information down two different highways but what the net effect for you is is that you don't care what your speed test is because it just works and um it's it's made the anxiety levels for me go way down with this live stuff and you know I just did a a Mac update on my Mac and it was like nine nine gigs I think 10 gigs for the files and uh on my old connections that would have taken six hours probably so it was much faster yep yep um one other thing before we dive into the install because we did some cool stuff on the physical install uh because I know that was a new rig and we wanted to show off some of the things that our customers can do with some of our products we're not an installer um we are working on a really cool partnership with the national installation Network that we will have in the future uh to share with you folks we're just making sure that we don't recommend anything that we don't feel 100 confident about but these guys are they're training the trainers we'll put it that way these are these are some of the best guys out there uh so we do have installation assistance coming but um before we talk about that the last thing that we gave Mike was a Cutting Edge beta test it's coming out soon to the public um Fusion Sim data plan what that essentially is it's a mobile must have exclusive data plan that we gave to Mike that gives him uh access to all three major carriers through one uh data plan that he purchases from us and we have a data center out in in the cloud and we load that up with all of our different data plans and Mike has selected Verizon as his primary but then we put a t and T-Mobile in his account so his router without a SIM card will use the starlink or the T-Mobile SIM that he has online and it will go out and get another sim card from the cloud and inject it into that second modem so what that means is I can give Mike a data plan that's better at his specific location at the click of a button without having to send him anything or do anything and I think that that got I think that guy got a little hot water in one location it wasn't bad but T-Mobile was just on The Fringe and you were parked under a tree yeah literally parked halfway under a tree and there was a little bit maybe about that much of the antenna that had a clearest view of the sky and even then it it worked it worked great it was working but it was it had a little bit of packet loss so we had we we swapped the remote SIM from T-Mobile to Verizon and boom we were well past the 100 mag really quickly so that remote product remote Sim or what we call Fusion Sim product is coming soon but that's that means you can pay one bill and get three carriers essentially which is a really cool technology we've been working on for a long time and again we're getting all kinds of sneak peeks of of stuff that's coming down the pipe on this I could talk about all kinds of stuff when we don't have anyone listening it's easy hey you got at least yeah no we've got quite a few people watching actually so we'll tell them to ask questions I'm looking at the comment I'm just looking at comments and saying yeah look at that yeah I like the wall yeah it really is uh it I'm just calling it magic Eric so I don't know how it works to be able to use the three carriers and starlink and pull the best out of all of that uh on a reliable basis around the clock really has been has been really amazing for us it you know we uh I have to literally plan my trips or ahead up until now I'm based okay where am I going to be on Sunday night or am I going to have really good internet on Sunday night and often we'll do live stuff you know just as the week as story RV stories break and everything and am I in a place where I can I can get a good signal and when I edit my video it's a big file it's several gigs am I going to be someplace on Thursday or Friday where I can get that loaded up to YouTube and and so it is it has affected our travel we have some places we haven't been able to go because I got to be good internet on Thursday night or Sunday night so that's a it's like it's like suddenly we can we don't have to worry about that anymore yeah that's pretty that's pretty powerful damn that's a that's a huge difference it sounds like um right yeah I mean I was I keep telling people that when I go to a new Campground I do not log into this stuff and check it and mess with it I just kind of move on with my life and you know we do surveys when people purchase our products and you know we ask like what what was your biggest concern and consistently people are like I just want to like is this really gonna work so you know we're trying to get more candid conversations with people who refer to this as magic don't even care they're like does it work or not and did it solve my problem and that's that's um that's great to hear I'm glad that was that was a 2 000 plus mile investment that that I had a lot of confidence would go well but it's good to hear it well so Eric it looks like Andy has managed to tee up a slideshow of some of the pictures of the install would you mind talking us through what what you've been able to do this is the first time we've ever done this part by the way so just bear with us if there's some technical challenges yeah no I mean so I can see it I think this is the uh if Mike allows me can I talk about your your house is that all right yeah all that stuff that you see that stuff is stuff that Eric took out of those cabinets by the way let me know yeah what a mess it was nice and clean until he started throwing stuff all around yeah so this is the rear this is the rear of Mike's Montana fifth wheel so this if you're looking at this television in the dead center of that picture this is that's effectively like dead center to the rear of the vehicle those windows on the left and the right are are looking out the back on uh on Dual dual slides um so we looked at the the location of this cabinet as a potential good installation area so in the top right uh cabinet area we said oh this looks interesting and what you see in the center of this it's a little bit far away but you'll see he's got a a stereo system right above the um the TV that was factory installed so that's kind of like a little gold mine for me I go oh I bet you there's all sorts of power and areas to run wires that are going to be available here from our from our friends at the factory um so so uh we we popped off those little stereo fronts and found everything we needed to to do an internet stall and we went straight up from this rear cabinet that you see up on the right and uh and ran our roof antenna up to the roof and um we'll get into this uh probably on the next shot but I'll keep my comments until I see the next one okay cool so um we we purchased a roof mountable box uh this is just a nine by six by four inch waterproof exterior box um that we can you can pick up from anywhere and uh this is just using a standard what I call flush cut tool to cut out a uh a face to put in one of our wire entry systems that is made by a company called icotec here is an example of that if you can see my camera we'll show this to you after we do the screen share I'll show you a better example but the goal for me with Mike because Mike is a tech guy he likes a lot of tech stuff was I wanted to put one hole in the roof and I wanted that hole to be a service Inlet Port that he could run anything he wanted to in the future through that same Inlet Port without that I'm going to scrape out die core without having to retool without having to reseal could Mike just add a wire to this setup or add something else to this setup without having to redo everything so by installing this box in our Ico Tech cable management system on the side of it we'll show you some additional pictures here if we go next I think we've got one of the the roof right yep so what you see there is there's these small little cable inserts that are made for all the wires that come in from that roof antenna that powers our internet solution believe it or not this sucker has eight cellular antennas Up on the Roof uh two wireless antennas and a GPS antenna so that's 11 wires and then I have to add starlink so it's 12 wires so if you had 12 wires going through some junky cable gland system it might just not look very good so we we use the icotec products because they not look great but they're modular and then you can change them out if anything changes in the future so what that looks like uh is we drill a single hole down from the roof two inch hole and then we grab a piece of uh I think it's 1.5 inch but it's actually two inch exterior diameter PVC and we secure that down from the cabinet up through the roof and if you you can actually see that right there in that picture if you look you see that little piece of PVC pipe sticking up from the roof and then we've sealed with uh self-leveling sealant the Box all along the bottom the pipe all around that and the four screw holes that will be in the box that will secure the box down creating a waterproof Tight Seal so what that does is it gives you that which you see right there which is a very clean looking modular system that can input all the wires from that roof antenna that you see over on the right that's our parsec Great Pyrenees which is an 11 in one monster antenna not monster in size just amazing that they got eight cellular antennas in there for dual 5G into a little 10 inch round circle and uh that goes over into that box and then down into the cabinet so I think we've got a finished yeah so that's kind of an overview right there we went with a magnet Mount surface antenna more for flexibility in the future for Mike I didn't uh want to create too many extra holes for them so that antenna we've got little square you see there is actually just a piece of galvanized steel and we silicone that down to the roof with no screw holes so we said you know what we're just going to put this down uh with uh with no screw holes and then the antenna just magnet sticks to it just an interesting way to mount them up it also gives you the flexibility to run the cables out to that junction box right I mean that that that's another element of this that makes it a little bit easier exactly I mean there's certain also like if I had put the antenna and just going straight down with the antenna that would have been fine but we were very close to the rear cap of the vehicle So the antenna you might have it might have like been a little bit further off and also the Montana's have a fairly decent slant on the back side where they pitch water off the back so I felt a bit more comfortable if the antenna was a little bit more centered uh which also allowed me to keep it a bit further away from the air conditioners um They Don't Really they say it's 18 inches or more from an AC is fine but I think a little further keeps keeps it so it works really well you know really remote locations and that kind of gives you an idea what you what you get as a finished product you see all those cables are going into all those little ports and these aren't things that you have to figure out we sell all the grommets and all the kits for everything we sell so you just say hi this is the this is the product I have and we send you the kit that works with it you don't have to like pick all these parts on the inside what was that I was just going to say um uh what I also like about that is by separating out all of the cables you're sort of making it harder for water to to get in there but through the combination if a lot of people try to do one big bundle of cables and that's a great way to siphon water back into your RV right yeah like get a big cable gland stick a bunch of wires through it and then just squeeze it tight it it works um at least for a year but uh it's not optimal to give you guys some backstory of icotec first of all they're German and they're they engineer like Germans uh it's super super over engineered um but these are designed for um for High industrial CNC Factory wet wet environments so these are actually were designed to be in big massive factories when we called them and said we were bringing them to the RV industry I I had a lot of conversations with senior Executives before they figured out what I was trying to do and then they loved it um you know we're we're a global distributor of the product now uh which we're excited about but um but uh it's a great fit for what we're trying to do because they're used to like harsh chemical environments and all this crazy stuff and we're like yeah we just want to keep rain out crack in the sun basically now that big the larger gray wire that looks like it's going into that box is that the feed from the starlink unit yes the big mama uh that's starlink uh uses a category seven ethernet cable which most people probably haven't heard of it's eight millimeters in diameter it's a fat cable um and it's needed because it provides power to the dish that's why it's so big and and you I was going to say as part of this not not to lead the witness too much but you uh you you went with the bigger as Mike talked about the bigger flat Mount new starlink setup correct oh yeah yeah well I mean the problem with the 500 dish is you can do an install like this because you have to take it down when you go to leave so you'd be in a situation where I'd either have to create some plug or something and I mean Mike I saw him doing karate chops and and running doing backflips but uh I don't think he's super excited to get up on his roof every time he parks yeah I ended up using a telescoping flagpole that I mounted on the rear ladder and to bring the starlink in you know you would have to bring it out of the dish unwind it put it on the pole get that on the on the flagpole or on the ladder extend it up make sure it was locked every as soon as you got it up there it wouldn't be locked and it would come crashing down and then you know if there was a lot of wind through the campground you'd want to bring it down because you know it's I think it's a 18 foot extending uh and a lot of a lot of rvers use it and it's fine they don't mind the work you can take it sometimes and put it on a picnic table if you need to take it to a clear area for the sky but the point was is that it was a lot of work it added five to ten minutes of work then you had to get the antenna into the RV some people would come through a slide some people would put it in like a wet Bay and then run an external extension cord up through the wet Bay to connect to the router but this as you can see in that photo is I would say it's half to half as big again as the as the little pizza box the standard one but it's flat and it it just picks up a lot more of those satellite signals it's expensive it also doesn't need to articulate right the old the way the old one sort of needed to our take it doesn't need to be it is kind of on a little angle I noticed like that yeah there's there's no moving Parts um it's it is it's on a it's on a wedged Mount uh kind of tilted forward like a car is tilted forward um mostly from a weather perspective it's to make sure that water doesn't collect on the on the lid of it aerodynamics nothing else yeah it's a spoiler yeah yeah yeah but uh your size makes and Eric said it would make a difference and it really does it really does lock onto those signals so much faster yeah I don't I don't have the exact I this would be for our friends at the mobile internet Resource Center um which you can check out our memberships for but they have an epic starlink Resource Center um but uh but I believe it's around a hundred like it's almost like 200 percent more surface area or 80 more surface area that it has access to to the sky the dish is if you put it next to a standard dish it's actually the size of two dishes so it makes sense that it's got a much wider ability to to look at everything but most people don't feel like it's that much bigger because it doesn't have the big stick coming out of the bottom that you have to deal with and and all that but yeah you're you saying it's much more expensive is not a joke it's four plus times the price it's a 2500 setup yeah for that for the dish alone and and again I I as I keep telling the the people I've been talking to about this is this this is not for the average rver because you know the router is also expensive the antenna but um there Comes A Time if you work on the road you you know it's just not you can't work if you don't have reliable internet uh so um for us it's it's you know nobody wants to spend that much money but it's still um it's a necessity to do the job the privilege of working from the road requires I think that you have a good solid system and um man I've been just blown away with it all right Mark was asking about the Ico tax they're not on our website yet I did want to just cover that but if you message our team at info mobilemustab.com and you have a particular installation use case uh just message us and we will get you everything you need it's all in stock we have it all it's just the way we just have to add like I don't know it's like 150 different part numbers so we're just dealing with that I had to introduce you all about Bo's out here with me my cat was very curious to know why Beau deposited that much fur on my clothes when I got home that's why Bo liked it he likes your smell of your cat oh it's so cool what what kind of dog is that it's uh what kind of dog is that Mike Bo is a Norwegian Elkhound they're both beautiful say hi to everybody there he is looks a lot like no more chasing birds yeah now there's this bird's running around the yard chickens actually from somebody another a couple of houses down here from where we are but um he doesn't mind chickens he just likes to chase him but the chickens bring coyotes and we have coyotes that regularly run through here and he takes a great personal offense of seeing that coyote in here yeah absolutely absolutely Mark just said he emailed and we said we didn't stock them they are in stock as of today so I'll let the team know uh later today that they can change that messaging and we do have them uh for the Ico Tech stuff this is all Fireside Chats where you're going to hear all the Cutting Edge stuff so make sure you subscribe to these I will I will try my best to always have some good uh follower Easter eggs in here yeah so to wrap up my solution because he did mention this is not for everyone and I think that that is absolutely true but we we have done a pretty decent job of trying to get a little bit of the flavors of every for everyone out here what Mike has is What's called the ultimate Road Warrior 5G that's our bundle and then he is added the starlink fixed Mount option um yeah so those together we're gonna be in the the 6K territory so you're spending a few bucks um not gonna lie it's it's an investment but time is money and if you're making money with this solution this is an area to consider um I've met a few folks on the road who've either had to come off the road or have had to get different jobs because they couldn't figure this out so that's everyone's personal preference but to to just wrap up some recommendations and then we'll stop uh ultimate Road Warrior 5G and we'll put links in that in the description for Phyllis who's asking a question on that um but for folks that don't necessarily need dual 5G but want to go with the starlink option we have something called the speed demon 5G it looks very similar just smaller and it's single 5G now all that redundancy Mike is talking about about how he never has problems it's going to be hard to be redundant with one connection but if you're going to put that star link into this you're talking starlink in 5G this is a good combination that'll drop that price down by about 1800 bucks or so down so this router is 9.99 versus 28 and change so you come down quite a bit if you go with the uh what's called the speed demon 5G and for that exact same price point if you want ultimate reliability the the ultimate Road Warrior not 5G again saves you about 1800 bucks that's 4G technology so you get dual 4G plus you can add the starlink we we cover that in the last fireside chat I don't want to dive into 5G versus dual 4G everyone loves 5G because they've watched 10 million commercials good that sounds great but watch that fireside chat because I they're the same price I don't care what you buy but trust me you want to watch that to know which one's the better one if you're in that price point I'm done I'm done sorry Mike I mean has has you talked a little bit about this before but what what does all of this flexibility and capability unlock for you as you as you guys get to go continue it means that um it means that I can't get out of work by saying oh sorry I don't have an internet connection so that's why but it really means that uh you know we we certainly you know we as I mentioned earlier on we do a regular Sunday night live feed and there have been many times when we just haven't been able to have a good enough signal to do it and we have people waiting and watching for us and you know you you don't want to ever let an audience know that you can't get through because uh yes they say well wow they may not get through we won't watch them next week so that means that I can be pretty sure that we're going to be able to have a good signal on Sunday nights and also as I said um I send massive video files uh for our YouTube videos that take and there have been times I would start to send a file at at 6 30 at night and I would just let it run all night long and by 8 30 the next morning it was still sending it wasn't in yet and that is very frustrating um so this you know it's not like this but uh as I said I just sent some files that would have taken me probably a couple of hours uh I just sent them through this system a little while ago this afternoon and it was I think you know 12 minutes something like that not very long uh wow that's cool that's a big difference and that means I have more free time that I can you know we tend to work on a schedule where uh we shoot a lot of video or we're out taking photos we just came back from the Elkhart uh Dealer open house and you know that you go you shoot you don't know how long a video shoot is going to come back and then you want to put together in our case we had to put together our podcasts which came out yesterday so I shot Monday came back uh on Monday night and wrote and edited the podcast and Bam it was right up I was able to send it right up to our servers instead of having to wait all night long to send those files so it just makes my time much more efficient and ultimately you know it allows us to be more competitive with other people who are doing what we're doing you know we're able to content is King and as soon as you send something up the question is is that you did for us today but what are you doing for us tomorrow and you got to be thinking about tomorrow so for us it's all about your next broadcast right that's right for us uh I don't have that pressure and uncertainty of can I get a good enough internet signal uh it's only been three weeks now and I've vowed to I would at least give it a month and and maybe a couple more States but uh we're on a we're on our way now to Nashville and we'll be testing it out throughout Nashville and then into Eastern Tennessee and I anticipate the same the same results so I'm geeked yeah it's pretty geeky if you want to really give us a run for our money go to Orlando that's a fun one for us to test because that is one of the hardest places in the entire country to cover Atlanta we do it well uh or Orlando Florida it's a uh it's got some cell problems but uh we we do it well but if you wanted to crush if you wanted to be the guy who everyone's walking over going you have internet go stay in a Thousand Trails Park in Orlando and you'll uh you'll sell a lot of Internet kit there I plan to do a full how how video um a week from Saturday that will show how this all came about and and uh how Eric and Andy uh climbed all up and trashed our RV and installed and they actually cleaned up off themselves they were pretty good all right okay it's been three weeks the uh the real cracks and stuff won't show up for a little while yeah don't tell me that is it is a nice system and again uh after 12 years and um much of it in frustration over just not having enough internet to get the job done uh this was worth uh I think I'm I'm prorating it and figuring I had another 12 years to go and uh it'll be it'll work out to just another uh a few hundred dollars a year investment after I after it gets all done but uh but we have connectivity and uh we appreciate it yeah yeah we we're so excited to have somebody with who speaks plain English and you know isn't overly technical you know turning all the dials and everything uh which is great technical folks love this stuff but we want to know that you know the average consumer who's just a high demand internet usage you can get this stuff going and love it our our motto is no geek speak one of my books yes the no geek speak Guide to the internet I wrote one yes yes wow you did your research yeah I tried you know yeah absolutely yeah we uh we will follow up on this channel I believe next week with a uh with an installation video that's more that Andy's going to publish that um we'll go into some of where the technical things of what we did for the installation and that will tee up us to to share um your channel and everything that you're doing with our followers so they can check out uh your your future video as well which I'm sure will be better produced than ours we really appreciate it and uh I'm just glad I can help well it was it's great we are um we're thrilled and I've been very impressed with the company and I should tell everybody by the way that how we found you through our friends uh Chris and Sheree the mobile internet Resource Center they've been uh working with you guys for years they are our go-to experts uh for RV connectivity and uh I I got to the point I said guys I I gotta have a great system and that's how we connected with you and um the service has been great and I think you enjoyed the challenge of it I think you really did so I did I did and I got to quietly tell my wife that I was driving out to Indiana and I might be picking up a new RV on the way [Laughter] she's like you brought home what and I'm like just thinking you know it just attached itself to the trailer I don't know what happened you know yeah well it's like it's just a small bumper pull it's okay so uh well you guys will see that in future install videos I'm excited we're uh we got an all-aluminum ATC trailer that uh has its own set of challenges when you're sitting in a giant metal box trying to get internet so it should make for some fun so so I mean my lastly what what else do you have planned for the rest of the year were you guys headed and what what do you what's what's your plan for uh what what can we tell our our massive audience to go to go look look well one of the one of the ways we travel is um we have what we call our Serendipity travel and it's kind of like a oh look there's something over here and we turn it that way but in general uh we're off to Nashville and Tennessee in the next uh two weeks um we've got uh some stuff we want to do in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan before the snow starts to fly in another month we are looking at the Tampa RV show as the next Big Show we'll probably go to uh then there's a whole trip through the to Tampa uh the debate now is whether we're going to leave Tampa and head straight to quartzite or whether we skip Tampa and go to quartzite and take our time getting out that way uh We've uh we usually do all the big RV shows and and I've done we've done quartzite but we haven't done it in a couple three years and I love traveling west and now that I have this system I don't have to worry about uh I might I might meet you out there for that quartzite is one of the most fun places to show off that system because everyone is hurting out there for internet that's great well they're all claiming I just interviewed uh Kimmy King who is the who puts on the big uh Courtside RV Show and she says that they I asked her about internet and she says everybody's using starlink or they there's a new system that uh people can buy uh for a month and I said she didn't know what the speeds were but I don't think it's I don't think it's really fast speeds but uh make up a little money and just charge people to come in and use my system you know if they have to I in the first uh first escapers bash I provided Internet to the entire bash uh sorry not the first that's not fair uh Chris and Sheree ran the first my dates are off it was 2016. so they couldn't make it I believe it was the second annual it's either the second or third yeah so we had we were broadcasting Wi-Fi to the entire campus there it was fun um but uh so it can be done but that was much slower speeds back in those days but um but yeah your system's cool like what I do is we can tune your system to not use the local towers that all the prop people are on and we can point you out to Five Mile out Towers because it's so flat out there and get your speeds way up there's some really fun tuning that we can do yeah I might be my wife is just talking to me about going west and I was like really because we have a nine month old and I didn't think I was going to get another swing at that uh before school uh but she's like if we don't do it now we're never gonna do it and I'm like let's go yeah good answer the court side is yeah I love the desert and I will come last few days of the show and we may do a couple of podcasts from the show but then everybody leaves and the desert is all open and wide open for us and that's my favorite February is my favorite month in the desert so that that might be uh that's that's if I can talk my wife into it so yeah yeah well she's probably watching a little more than I do so we'll figure out how to combine something and get some Creature Comforts that everyone can appreciate and uh that sounds great I love it out there but yeah from an internet perspective I just I think that anyone who the amount of people that go out there for like one week it's just impossible for them to invest in the infrastructure they would need and then 90 of the time no one would be on that Network so it's like that's why the internet's so bad out there it's like population 1100 population 11 million well the population in quartzite goes from I think it's 900 in the town and then the during the month of January it's up to 1 million 750 000 to 1 million rvers come and settle in that BLM land all around coresight it's an amazing every rver needs to experience it because it's pretty cool it is cool yeah I think I think Eric at one point you had some some good Drone footage of uh quartzite well maybe yeah like that somewhere too I've got a bunch from LA from two years back that we can we were we were I got long story short I had five bars on a Verizon tower and no data and I finally found the Verizon tech and he's like we don't plug data into that Tower I go what's it for he goes it's for phone calls and emergencies I'm like okay thanks so that's and everyone's walking around going it says 5G I can't bring up a website yeah sorry but your phone Call's really clear yeah well you're connected via 5G to that Tower there's just nothing past the tower connecting you to the internet yeah so I hopefully this year is better that was two years ago um but uh Mike it's so good to see you and talk to you I guess we can throw a little one more Easter egg in is that I surprised Mike and dropped after his install the next day dropped off a a full water uh purification system for him so he he'll talk more about that on his channel if if he likes it or he'll it's that exit to me if he doesn't we'll see pure water don't give away all my stories now Eric that's all coming no well I mean it might be a bad story so we'll see if you like it I'm not gonna I have not asked for any feedback I said test it make sure you really think it's good or bad and tell me what you're thinking cool stuff will do well I'm excited I'm excited that we have another uh a test tester for all of this this new tech so it's uh Mike we appreciate you uh letting us mess with your setup that way and you know it's it's a it's it's awesome so far it's it's amazing I really have been amazed I will and I don't say that easy so it's it's been great well thanks thanks for having me on our YouTube RV Lifestyle Channel on on this on the 14th of October so okay well so when when that video goes live we'll add it we'll add it as a pinned comment on this video so people can go check that out as well you know for for our audience to come check out your audience and uh other than that well thank you so much for for taking the time to spend spend the hour with us and we really appreciate it and uh have fun out there on the road we can't wait to see where you go next yeah well we're on the way even now as I start to back this up yeah I was gonna say we have we have a pretty hard out here in the sense that you're packing up to to hit out head out on the road this afternoon too so yeah I gotta get to Nashville by Sunday and uh test out two more states with this uh with this new system so I can say we've been in five states with it so far thanks Mike we'll see you soon happy

oh my gosh hi my name's Dave uh and this is Eric we are part of mobilemusthal.com and we want to welcome you guys to our first live second live stream event uh we're gonna try and do these at least once or twice a month uh or maybe more if we have enough guests to be able to do that um if if anybody's joined already thank you for for coming in and paying attention to to us for the next hour or two uh please stay tuned at the end we're gonna have a special one-off uh coupon code for the deal of the week that we're going to use for this event um the theme of this week's live stream is really to talk about a question that we get a lot on mobilemustab.com which is is it better to have a single 5G modem or dual 4G modem and the perfect the perfect batteries I had against the wall answering that question every week right just answer it live for once so that way it's a good question it's not a bad question that's why everyone has it but yeah exactly exactly and and it's it's not a question that's a bad question and it's a question that when people ask it they're asking it for the first time but it just means we get to answer it a lot because we answer that question for the first time for people over and over again so we figured rather than tell people what to do we'd show them and in so many ways Eric you know at the core that you've used more of these products I think than anyone probably including most of the paplink engineers at this point uh I'd say in a mobile setting that might yeah in a mobile will qualify that they probably use them in Office Buildings a little more than I do hopefully but you know let's let's talk about it like what at the end of the day right let's let's go over these two products a little bit and and see what what are the the sort of wave tops of each of them yeah I mean I think I think the question comes up a lot because it's you come in as somebody who's you know new to mobile internet or who's who's kind of got some bumps and bruises right so you're maybe you you hopped into a Verizon store you picked up a hot spot for free or for 300 bucks it's supposed to do everything the guy said it was great and you know you hop into your Airstream and you realize without any external antennas you're standing inside of a giant metal box and you have no service and it's a big hot mess or uh or not maybe you uh you're outside everything works good you test two hours before your Zoom call and your Zoom call happens to be when everyone's getting back uh and firing up Netflix and it kind of destroys your call and everyone at the office goes yeah I knew this guy couldn't work remotely it was just going to be checked out that that was my biggest fear when I hit the road so I in terms of the reason why this question comes up a lot is because you know this is right now as of four months ago our top selling product uh it is a single 5G cellular uh router that is really more of a mobile command center because it's even though it is single cellular you could plug a lot of other stuff into it and unify those connections together into creating something a lot more redundant than one connection which is most of the other stuff out on the Internet is is one connection even devices that say that they can have more than one connection are doing something called load balancing which means that you're only going out one of those connections even if you have two at any given time they're not combined so if one of them goes down and that's the one you're using disconnect message versus with prepping products you can combine them together and anything can go down and you can stay up as long as you've got one left so we're always like you know I don't know a lot of people who sit on a one-legged stool or even a two-legged stool uh I think three is kind of the minimum and that's what I tell people about internet you should have three touch points out to the internet but why is this the most popular device right now if it's single 5G we'll get into that but before I talk about it the reason why the question comes up so much is because this which is a dual 4G called The MAX Transit and this which is the single 5G called the br1 pro are both 9.99 so you you it's nice because you don't have to make a price decision you're at the same price but it's confusing because you're like wait so I get two of something older or one of something newer that's kind of how it feels yeah and I think and I think the big question for a lot of people is what's the compromise there is is there really that much of a comp if you can only use one modem at a time to to talk about what you had said before you know is there an advantage to having two of the two of the slower modem really or not I mean it's a great question so with the pebbling products you can use the connections at the same time whatever those connections are Campground Wi-Fi which is kind of annoying but it's called Wi-Fi as Wan I'm going to use Wi-Fi as my Wan what does Wan mean when just means internet source it means more than that but for the digital Nomads it means internet source we talk about wins how many lands do you have sounds kind of funny uh we're talking about how many internet sources do you have so you know this modem came out the 5G one came out you know and it was definitely not our top performing device for a very long time and that's because you were relying on One Touch point to the internet which was the cellular now with the on with the introduction of external devices that you can now use starlink being the biggest one this starts to get pretty interesting because now I can plug starlink into one of these ports up on the front and I can use that embedded 5G and I can Bond them together and now I have two points out to the internet I've got a two-legged stool it's better it's like a bicycle I got two wheels it's not as stable as four wheels but I can I you know I can I can get around and not feel like it's a total death trap so the the real kind of area of where it becomes a question because it's funny I just picked up a a uh a trailer we had a trade show trailer so we traded in one that was really more for like pallets of equipment and we got a more of a toy hauler so I could sleep in it and then we can load it up with gear for the trade shows so it was the first time in a while that I had a new RV I was like oh I gotta I gotta figure out what I want to put in and I kind of can pick anything um yeah it's a blank canvas right I mean yeah and ironically it's all aluminum so that'll be a future chat because I learned I've been telling people in airstreams for a while like oh yeah you know this is a problem I just lived through it for 2000 miles and I'm like holy it's a problem oh it's an actual problem it's not yeah something yeah oh I did a live stream under an umbrella at a picnic table outside going well this is probably not the best way to handle this but because because you know electronics and and Rain work so well right yeah it was it was super fun but uh but future to that I had to make this choice I was there I was like oh and this is something that um I will use primarily for um for while I'm doing travel for business trips but I'm going to be doing a lot of internal meetings Fireside Chats things like this and I'm going to be in a ton of different locations and what I tell people is I don't actually spend almost any time in my primary RV ever in the public interface like we do all of these chats and we tell people and we show people how to set everything up I I have four Cellular Connections plus starlink I turn them all on I Bond them together I never think about it it just works I don't even know what I'm connected to at any given time for the most part they're just whatever doesn't work drops out whatever does work I use and I move on with my life and I get back to work it's very similar to how you'd be in an office you're not thinking about how you're getting the Internet it's just on you know you think about it it's lunch it's it's a constant versus something that's even a variable for day-to-day life which is you know that's a big difference so I thought about it and I said to myself um wow interesting I'm gonna get a Transit and there was actually another factor which is sort of interesting here and this is sort of an Easter egg for for anybody joining um in that the there's a new technology with peplink that's coming out it's been out for a little while but it's starting to actually get um some legs and starting to get more organized and it's called Uh Fusion Sim or remote Sim and it's the ability to somewhere in another location or locally but for us we have a Data Center and we load up our data center with SIM cards and data plans and I have the ability with the transit to travel around with a very inexpensive low-cost like 10 15 data plan that has you know 10 gigs on it it's very small because this trailer doesn't go anywhere it just kind of stays in the in the driveway unless I'm on a trade show and as soon as this thing boots up it goes to the data center and goes and grabs a p1000 and r1000 one terabyte data plan from Verizon and T-Mobile and remotely puts them into this device one on each of the device uh one on each of the modems and and just to be clear like that's something so those Sims living in the cloud wouldn't necessarily have to only be tied to this one Transit but they could be in any of your other RVs or even maybe your home internet if you exactly now right for anybody watching this don't get confused yes you could go set up your own Fusion Sim Cloud you'd need a data center or a home something you'd have to go buy a Sim injector they're only 500 bucks that'll get you eight Sims and you could then go grab this thing from the cloud and grab Sims but the future of what mobile must-have is looking to do potentially we're still testing it we'll probably do a live test with folks over the next 30 days like kind of like a live beta is um is that we will be able to offer our data plans to folks remotely so no more waiting around for a SIM card to show up it's you sign up you know within 24 hours I'd like to see that be like within four hours but I want to commit to that yet boom you've got your data and uh when you're done with it you could just be done with it and it makes the the world a lot simpler what it also means is for us we're we're going to potentially offer more than one data plan so you might sign up for the fusion Sim 500 and that will get you access to all the carriers so if you're in an area where T-Mobile doesn't connect it's just going to roll over and try another Sim and another Sim and you'll get connected and you'll get the gigs you paid for so that's not the point the point is this device and all single modem devices that peplink sells don't support that Pro they don't support that technology so yeah do you think is that yeah is that one of those sort of what I would call an artificial limitation or is that really a hardware limitation of the fact that that they're different it's a different style of processor in so many ways it is actually a hardware limitation uh there is a small Hardware chip that they incorporated into all of the Dual capable devices because they knew well you have to have one online already to go get the second Sim yeah so if yeah I so there's no point in spending the extra probably 20 bucks on that chip in there if if they need to have a second connection anyway so devices that support that Transit br2 which is the the big mama dual 5G that we can wrap up and talk about if this is in your budget this is the choice I mean yes we'll talk about that but you know this is more than twice the price of that 999 price point so I don't want to go there we'll just spend more money um balance20x there's there's another one that does support Fusion Sim and that remote Sim capability but so that's one big reason for me because yeah because ultimately the balance just to key in on that for a second with the balance 20x it's a single modem pep link but it has the ability to add multiple modems natively into it right exactly like this for instance and it's probably hard to see but this is an optional module right in the front that's adding a cat 12 to the existing cat4 that's right there and then the USB port on the front I could add a 5G you could have up to three in this device really really killer device that uh by the way the price promos on that which are like four there's like a 75 or there's we'll we'll link it that but there's a discount until the end of this month and it's gone so the price is going back up on that for everyone to know about is is that the discount on the cat4 version of the cat 7 version which is so the background of that promo was that they had a supply chain shortage of cat4s so they made the cat7 cheaper but now they've restocked cat fours so now they're like we're not going to just give away the cat sevens for the same price because we don't we don't buy the Cat four if you want the lower price but the cap four for our community is is two it's not it's not going to get it done why why why do you say that that's a great question so LTE is uh is evolved over a long period of time and you sort of Saw multiple stages of Lte but when you get into the transit which is sort of the last type of Lte where you could survive with two antennas for you to go to four antenna mode it supported the ability to have multiple connections up to the Cellular Tower so that's why you were able to get much faster download and upload speeds and that's kind of what those categories mean so a category four modem may have a max speed on average nationally of 8 to 10 12 megabits and a category 12 will be 60 70 80 much much faster and it's not it's just literally multiple connections to the cell tower stacking on top of each other to make that more effective yeah um but yeah I know I went way around the circle there but for me I'm not going to put starlink on that on that trailer um it's just it's just I'm parking under trees just so much more frequently and it just seems to be a 50 of the time I can't use it situation um so the investment in the the flat high performance dish is not really something I want to do and I just know I'll never set up the portable one if I have two 4G cell connections because I know they'll work I know I'll get there I know I'll be on online and working and I'm not oh let me go get on the roof with starlink it's just not for me personally um I don't think it's going to be something that that I'll do so you know that's what really knocks out the 5G single modem for me because I don't think I'm gonna go set up the starlink which means most of the time I'm going to be on single 5G I can't use the remote Sim and um I'd rather have two 4GS than one 5G is it slower it's definitely starting to be noticeable the difference between 5G and 4G when we did these before yeah 5G used to be actually like we'd see You'd connect to 5G and it would be slower than 4G and you're like the 5G networks have been rolled out uh much more effectively T-Mobile's definitely kicking butt on that Verizon's doing pretty good as well a t I'm I'm not seeing awesome stuff yet but you know I don't maybe in the west I haven't seen a lot but um but those networks in in this uh area have have started to speed up so a single 5G connection can be really impressive But the irony is there's so many fewer people on the 4G now because all the devices are 5G so my 4G devices are starting to speed up so it's kind of like yeah you know there's more Spectrum well and in so many ways I'll bet you that has something to do with the fact that more and more people are transitioning their other mobile devices to 5G capable devices so they're having to sort of reallocate the bandwidth right exactly you're you know there's definitely a lot more Lanes on that Highway in 5G but um it is at least for my most recent travels I'm seeing the 4G stuff is sort of opening up a bit and it's starting to it's just not something I think about when I'm on Dual 4G I you know do a quick speed test if I have a speed Fusion tunnel I'm getting between 20 and 60 megabits on a combined tunnel I need and I know like you do not need as much as people are like just marketed to death with how much bandwidth they think they need you don't need a lot of bandwidth you need low latency and you need to uh have a decent amount of bandwidth this calls probably I could go look but it's probably pulling two megabits and you know Netflix will be three and if I turn on everything I could possibly think of it would be 14. so people are like I need 200 megabits I'm like negative like unless your job is to download files you know yeah because I I think a lot of that has come through the fact that the industry has learned to be more and more efficient with bandwidth as much as anything because it's probably the most expensive aspect of running any kind of internet companies the bandwidth itself right um any other than servers and people and everything else but just just thinking in terms of economy is economy I mean I suspect that the I don't I don't I don't know the business models but I think that the the wireless bandwidth or the amount of spectrum they have out there wirelessly is where the bottleneck is and that's why 5G has been so you know evolutionary it's like oh we can get more through the air so better compression better better performance better lower latency all of the above so you have that Advantage we get we get people these super awesome 5G routers and then we put bandwidth limits on all the devices this is what I'm saying like a little guy like well well you know I've got 5G I went through 500 gigs in a week and I'm like yeah because you're watching 4K Disney movies 24 7. do you need that no I don't 1080 is fine cool let's put limit let's put bandwidth limits on your devices to slow it down so I I think we're approaching that point where it's it's just a bit different now conversely uh like Mike wendland so we'll talk about that but the the CEO of RV lifestyle he's I think he's next week's guest yeah and um we put a starlink fix Mount and a whole kit on his RV that we'll talk about next week and you know we start doing speed tests and he's getting two to four hundred Meg down with priority data on starlink we were actually getting about 300 with Verizon it was starting to get to the limits of cool like we're like all right this is pretty cool stuff yeah killer roof antenna all this stuff so I turned off everything and I just put on starlink and we started messing around with latency and zoom and calls and the burstable nature of how Starling communicates with these satellites is really really good for Netflix it'll pump a bunch of data it's almost like a bullet it's like shooting a ton of information and then there's like a weight and then it shoots again and you know if you want all the technical let's yeah we'll get Andy from mobile internet Resource Center in and Kristen and that team they they spend their lives in that but we're walking they'd be a great guest for this at some point but yeah Dylan said they'd love to do it I just was on there what on their uh their webinar last week and and we'll we'll coordinate that but um but none of us will do a live on starlink alone we'll use starlink as part of our bonded connection but that is a gamble that is that's just not that's not again what I would would make so so that's an interesting because we're seeing a lot of Starling customers come to peplink and that's kind of where I started where it was like everyone you either came here because you you found it from someone else or you came here because you've got a couple scars and you're like I've already bought a lot of crap how do I how do I how do I get all this to to be unified and and just just to be clear and this is one of those questions that I'm answering I'm asking because I already know the answer but you have those scars too I mean going all the way back to to where mobile must have really started you you went on the road and you know listen to your RV dealer that told you you're going to have amazing internet from your your factory system right out the gate right I mean I he I knew that was BS um but I did uh I did go and buy the most expensive uh internet solution available in the RV industry if you opened up a keystone catalog at any dealership I went through and I found those things um and then I became an advisor on the board of of of uh some of the product development teams for those companies for a while before I started one must have I'm like guys like I know I could start a business and help you solve this um and just firmware after firmware after firmware it became abundantly clear to me that the software Engineers were doing their absolute best to run a really cool router multi-wan Router on a 20 piece of hardware and I'm like no matter what they do they're just not gonna get there because they don't have they you know what I mean it's just they didn't invest in the hardware so that yeah that that created the uh the need for me to start tearing apart police cars and that's what I found when I did that so so just just to key in on that point too how did you find peplink convert at first so uh a friend of mine is a sergeant of a police department in Stamford Connecticut I was doing a Ride Along with him and we were doing some work for the PD around some remote police stations around town and uh most of those we had of the ability to get wireless to it wasn't there I'm sorry wired internet too like cable modems things like that but we wanted some redundancy so we were looking at cradle Point products because that was just from my I.T background cradle points everywhere and um there just wasn't uh uh it was just really expensive when you got into the sd-wan components where we're tying it together so it kind of you know it's we were trying to figure it out and then we we uh honestly I think we were having a couple beers and I was like what what gets this police cruiser online and he's like I have no idea so I was like you mind if I start digging around in this thing he's like I don't care I mean it so I'm like pulling suitcases out and underneath the uh rear bench of his uh supervisor Cruiser I found the pebbling I found a br1 classic and I was like what is this hard metal I think I literally hold on I think I literally have oh that's awesome I love it here it is this is the original one that I found it's got gold lettering patient zero yeah and uh and that was it I I hit the road with with a version of that and uh and did my first video and I don't know a couple a couple people watched it yeah and the rest is history so to speak but um so we've we've had quite the discussion here uh and I think I know where you're gonna go with this but you know there's definite advantages to 5G there's definite advantages to to the Dual 4G at the end of the day where you go like if if it's you and it's your family and it's your travel what are you gonna pick so um if you if you caveated that with I had a thousand bucks to spend okay that's fair the answer might change um so I we we've been talk we probably transited our audience to death but it's something I really am passionate about because I want people to understand why it's a in my opinion it's a better choice for someone who needs reliable connections um for me the transit dual 4G has a faster processor in it than the single 5G what that means for me because it's designed to handle more connections at the same time so with this device I can do dual 4G I can then plug in starlink into this Wan port and then with the new firmware this Lan Port becomes a virtual Wan port a win too so I can then plug in say T-Mobile home if I want or a another router or more realistically I can go buy a single 5G as an upgrade path meaning this with Synergy mode plugs into this and now I have all three major carriers and I've spent less money with this setup than I would have if I bought this this is two grand I have both of them I was going to say by a fairly significant amount right I mean yeah this is 2800 for this big boy this is two grand for these two this is two modems this is three so yeah if you said you know you have a thousand bucks this creates for me the most flexible core and then from this core I can go to something like this yeah and you know we also should mention to folks I mean it's it's not a secret that the the x62 new 5G chips are on the roadmap for peplink so I don't have any confirmations I have I know they're on the roadmap I don't want to rumors and speculations yeah I'm not allowed to say um but that's another reason for me why in 5G I mean every you know how there's no 5G cat 27. it's just 5G yeah so that tells me we're really early right we haven't like started going five GPS which makes sense it makes sense in the sense that you know we really are at the very beginning of 5G in so many ways even on yes yeah it's it's it's it's it's mature but the x60 series chips 62 you know they they get you into another level so you know if I'm looking at something where I'm I need to get on the road now or in the next three months a Transit router gives me the fastest Hub processor to to group and aggregate all these connections while allowing me to know that if I pick up the next 62 New Generation 5G down the road I can plug it into this yeah um if the x62 new 5G comes out with an even faster processor I could plug this into that whatever has the fastest processor will be my Hub but it doesn't matter because then I'll have all of these connections and people might say well you just want three 5G modems you know like just get three five G's it's an option for cell antennas to the roof for each one of those motives so it starts to become a little bananas when you've got 12 wires Plus um their Wi-Fi if you want to go to the roof that's another two plus the GPS that's you know you're 15 plus wires and a wire bundle that starts to look like the size of like you know it's it's like a baseball of wires and yeah that's a big hole to drill in your roof too right yeah versus you know I'd rather have more 4G connections with two antennas I I've got a little bit more uh flexibility and when they're all bonded together anyway half the time it doesn't matter 5G 4G whatever one of the carriers sucks where I am so it's like I don't know I kind of am like I'd rather have uh have that at this point in time you know I think there might be a a period where where that changes but um but that's where I'm at now if you told if I was definitely building out a kit right now for starlink and all I wanted to pay for was one cellular data plan and starlink I would I'd go with the 5G it's just yeah you know it's a different different flavor for what I was facing for for the uh for the you know thing of the moment okay now since I just trashed the br2 I feel bad because like part of next week's topic I just sold this to Mike wendland who I'm gonna tell yeah you bought this no why is the this one cool I the Dual 5G is great but what I love is that the USB ports on the front it's one of the only devices that gives me that so that means I can add another 5G so technically if you want to just cellular beast mode out you get three 5gs out of this thing with with not a lot of work it's pretty much done and it's available now and that's got those killer promotions going right now with the 400 off if you're an existing peplink customer so it's like more than 20 off and it Stacks with membership discounts so it's like you're just never gonna see a deal like that on the br2s inside of 2023. yeah plus plus it's it's got if I remember correctly it's got dual Lan ports so you could you could run a starlink plus another modem that way too I mean you could there's a lot of the Box daisy chain it out of the box it has three so yeah you have two plus you have a virtual Wan that's enabled out of the box with the new firmware right right and then yeah I you know I think it's 100 bucks for another one if you want four it's it's a license based upgrade from there as long as you keep your Prime Care subscription so so yeah for folks that have external devices uh where they're trying to to leverage something the the WAN ports on that are are pretty awesome it's also really uh interesting at the marine application Level the br2 because they got a lot more real estate to work with and usually a little bit more budget um so multiple star links start to be really interesting in the br2 multiple cell multiple starlink you start to really be able to kind of go a little crazy yeah beast mode is a good description for it for sure it's just you know your your first purchase is is north of Two and a Half Grand it's it's just a different Market I and I we sell a ton of those um but you know for today I kind of wanted to say you know look the Netgear Nighthawk 5G hotspot is you know that was like the Mainstay of of everyone's life forever was 200 bucks for 250 or whatever and you know Netgear got smart and went oh my God we took a huge bath on this and now I think they're 6.99 or something so it's like everyone's starting to really realize that you know it's not just the spec sheet as much as it's the hardware build quality that really is what's going to get you into the reliable internet connectivity I mean it's just most I log into peplinks in the 28 30 35 40 50 days without a reboot they just don't care I mean and they would go further but I kind of have to turn off my power when I get out of the RV so they turn off with that but um they're just so stable and and I think that comes back to that DNA of where you found the pep Link in the first place which is you didn't find it in the bat like under the seat of someone's camper you found it in under the seat of an emergency vehicle you know where yeah like I love I don't hope I don't get rated for this but I know a lot of cops and they're not uh they're not technically Savvy I'll put it that way it's just it's either got to work and the extent of what they're going to do to try to get it to work is unplug it and plug it back in and if that doesn't do it they're getting they're moving on with their lives because they can't it just has to work so and and not just a lot of our customers right but but also I mean anybody in the emergency response world I mean we we you know we've we've been here a long time we you and I have had conversations with fire departments and ambulance teams and I mean peplinks peplink's been a a a pretty Rock Solid partner in that space for a long time yeah I mean speed Fusion is is is just a very unique very easy to set up technology that allows you to connect multiple connections together so that you know you just don't think about it it's just working and it's great you know that that model that they use of they kind of have the Apple model it's like every month we get a little beta firmware update and every quarter we get a full firmware update about and it's every single product is getting this update and getting this new set of features and is getting this new level of stability because they're running the same software on everything and yeah some of the RV industry competitors have talked to me and they're like we want to be your router game and I'm like I I don't know how you can get there without a fundamental redesign of like the approach of how you're developing this stuff because you you know you have to really invest in the software and the hardware and I think that's that's why most folks consider this kind of a the gold standard of mobile connectivity yeah oh well I mean you combine the reliability with the software with the flexibility and the technology it's kind of a hard combo to really beat from that standpoint yeah I mean I'm and I'm really happy and excited to talk about that like the cellular providers maybe I have to say thank you to Elon for this which makes me kind of cringe a little bit but but you know we um we saw Verizon take the first step and move and start to unfreeze High gigabyte data plans that were available to our viewers um through a channel where they didn't have to own a business um which they've they've kind of netted out as the resale Channel like they want us to run a business they want us to pay the bills for these big things but they're allowed they're letting us then sell them to customers which is nice you know and it's and it's uh Verizon took the first step um and ironically T-Mobile or at T has has thought on that as well we've had that announcement this week of our new ATT plans um which have historically been very gray Market also and and challenging to get a hold of them a lot of people have gotten in trouble buying stuff that was meant for tablets and other stuff that we've we've really you know done a lot to educate people on um so that's it's been nice to see these guys open up these big 300 gig data plans so that you can use these devices and it's not like you're buying them and then you're you're on another race to try to figure out how to get data for them right yeah because you know it's one thing to have the best technology and Hardware around but if you couldn't get data to support it what would be the point in so many ways I mean I think when you first went on the road you spent how much time on eBay trying to figure out if there were any kind of data plans out there oh it was like yeah we were all basis we were horse trading um grandfather data plans grandfather unlimited data plans they were selling for thousands of dollars online um but then after 15 it got a little more interesting we started seeing stuff you know Sprint always offered unlimited it just never worked anywhere [Music] there is a third component where you have to actually have cell towers um yeah but but you know data is you know there's more players I think competition inspires in in Innovation and and price competitiveness which is what we want to see to to make sure people can stay connected and you know why I'm still here and why I'm still peplink is it's it every single evolution of every single thing that's changed since the seven plus years I've been doing this that hasn't changed because their approach is not T-Mobile Verizon ATT T-Mobile home starlink their approaches we will take anything and get it connected and combine it and make sure that you're good and if that data plan goes away or that carrier goes away or that Tower goes away or that satellite goes away your device doesn't go away right it's still useful yeah yeah it's not tied to anyone any one team so to speak it it's it's completely agnostic which is great yeah and I I do since we're in Fireside it's kind of like more of like a less formal I definitely want to show people some some data that I see where I see speed tests occurring on certain made for home devices and it's like 400 Meg speed test and then I put like a port sniffer on it and then I actually download files from places where I pay for the bandwidth on the other side so I know exactly what's going on and I'm getting 65 megabits so so are you saying that there's some sense of maybe goosing the results to uh to to pad to pad the stats so to speak in some of those cases if you manage the router because you sold them the router and you have full access to the router and you have the ability to provide an unthrottled number when you're talking to one server but then throttle the rest of the other servers that's an interesting way for you to manage how much actual bandwidth being run over your network while making your customers shut up and go away because the speed test is really fast and that's how they know it's an interesting interesting thing to to highlight about that for sure uh yeah I'm not gonna say I I'm gonna you know look I'm not interested in pissing off too many Giants but it is not something where I actively want my internet service provider being in charge and having full remote access to my router that's not something I have ever wanted or thought was a good idea and when uh net neutrality went away and a bunch of laws went away to protect consumers I'm not sure it got better so yeah I think there's there's some a lot of Truth to that but um I just just to pause this discussion for one sec just to give people time to type because I know I can't type that fast uh if you guys have any questions please feel free to leave it in the comment section on Facebook or on YouTube we're live on both right now uh if you have any questions for Eric about any of this topic area or uh or or the br2 the br1 pro 5G the transit Duo Pro uh any of those products please feel free to type in some questions and we'll we'll come to you next here in a couple short minutes um now ultimately you you talked about starlink and you talked about sort of how it works great and bursts how do you think that um how do you think that is why do you think that is the case why do you think it's working that way in so many ways that's so above my pay grade but I suspect it's uh something traveling I mean there's something traveling thousands and thousands of miles an hour and it has to answer a lot of requests from a lot of different people and it's got to beam them out as quickly as possible and then move on and talk to another group uh while it has coverage before it's gone you know it's like moving in a different area um you know I haven't had to pass that on to the next satellite that's coming too doesn't it I mean it's it's it's I I'm I'm Grand I'm not going to ask you to comment on how a starlink works yeah I'm like sitting there going I don't even understand the synchronicity of the orbits or any like it's I I I think the technology works really well I'm actually surprised like genuinely surprised how quickly it evolved and how well it works um and you know for the average consumer that wants to watch Netflix and doesn't mind that they might have to move if there's a tree um I think it's kick butt and I think for the average consumer that is okay with all that and then adds a pep link and a cellular data plan as a backup you have a pretty darn well-rounded solution it's pretty good um I'm pretty happy with it with that that's why we sell starlings right they're on our store so so in so many ways to sum that up there's no wrong answer here right I mean if you're trying to choose between the br1 pro 5G and the transit Duo there's like No One's Gonna No One's Gonna fault you for making either one of those choices it's really comes down to flexibility I mean one other thing I don't think we really talked about yet or we haven't talked about yet was the idea of you know where is 5G in the country compared to 4G in terms of coverage across the country as in the US is a pretty big place you know yeah I mean 5G made it all the way out to you know some of the small towns that I grew up in Nationwide 5G has been been pretty pretty good you know I don't think most of the carriers are spending much time doing Tower maintenance and replacing equipment with anything but 5G so you know this is very different than millimeter wave 5G or Ultra wide band 5G this like you know go into a city and get gig speed downloads on your iPhone we get that question all the time is this billing and we're like no router period supports millimeter wave that's not a thing the the resistance between the little cellular modem and the antenna from literally this chip to here that little that much space kills millimeter width that's that's how sensitive millimeter wave is so inside your phone your millimeter wave antenna will literally be like like millimeters away from your modem chip um basically bolt it on let's like for intensive purposes bolted onto it at that point yeah like you're you're like your cell phone case will destroy millimeter wave like literally um so um so that's not really like a thing that's my little millimeter wave antenna right there so that's not really a a thing for most people but but Nationwide 5G which is your call it 400 megabit speed type 5G is is seeing um a lot of legs it's it's in a a good amount of places it's you know to answer your question again it's like it it's the setup time of the multiple connections when you're in a single modem device that worry me so that's why I always say the transit at the 999 below price point is the most reliable choice for for Reliable internet because for the most part literally driving down the road as long as you can get 12 volts to this thing it's going to always be connected to the towers that connect connect two you don't have to set up a dish or plug in anything you don't have to be reliant on a on an inverter if you're boondocking which starlink requires 110 volt power yes you can hot rod it a little bit by cutting some cables and doing some fun stuff or getting some third-party stuff to make it run on 12 volts but even then it's still immensely power hungry compared to one of these devices that's using you know 15 watts and a starlinks using uh I don't know 100 Watts 150 if you're in the fixed Mount it's like it'll Spike at 300 watts that's like that's a lot my entire RV every single computer in the entire RV and it's got touch screens everywhere we'll use 300 watts so Justice got me to 600. why do you think why do you think that is is that I mean one I think my theory if someone were to ask would would say they they intended the starlink system to be used in homes with with power first right I mean yeah I mean everything about the mobile kit including the mounts and everything looked very much as of an afterthought to a home like the fixed Mount dish is the business internet high performance dish with a different Mount like oh let's put a wedge mount on it and like change the cable because I bought that big expensive dish before the RV dish was available and was like this is basically the same dish um so I would encourage everybody to really check out the starlink resource center that we have at the mobile internet Resource Center um before I would even start speculating on why the power does what it does the the and anyone who's a member on our on our site um will will uh we'll receive pretty hefty discounts on products but also receive either read-only or full access to mobile internet resource center and the starlink resource center is exhaustive um they have uh been able to communicate directly with starlink in certain situations to make sure that the data is very accurate very nice yeah I mean they they have been good partners for us and um if if you don't know we also manage their tech support Forum within uh the mobile internet Resource Center as well so if you have tech support questions that's a great place yes sorry good distinction thank you don't ask me about about a neck here I'll probably comment I'll be there but I might be wrong it's interesting being an expert and an observer right you know so it's funny Andy on our on our uh back end was saying that we should talk of I think it's true like what our roles are inside of the organization I mean I think most people know who I am but I mean starting at the beginning that's an interesting quick thing like the two of us started this company uh and Andy Andy was customer number four customer front number four and employee number three I was employee number two and yes yeah yeah so I people people ask me what what do I do at mobile must-have and the answer right the best answer I can come up with is yes because yeah pretty much everything I've I've worn every hat you can imagine here which is it works for my brain because I think your official title is head of Special Projects but that does sound like a government title [Laughter] well it describes what he does but it doesn't tell us what he does at the same time so yeah hey we need to do a fireside chat Dave you run it okay it's a special project yeah phone call at 11 o'clock at night I got this no problem here we are so um yeah that's that's that's a good description of my role of this all of the above so yeah well I know we did zero promotion to get this out out into the wild I think we wanted to do more of an official test our last one was not even supposed to really be seen and all of a sudden like 20 people showed up and we were like ah like let's do some lighting uh yeah but I think this has been a good this has been a good test one also a very good discussion about the product one uh that that I think will have some legs even after the live stream um I'm I'm curious if if anyone has any questions on any of these topics uh we we I promise we are not as scary as we look in person um you know we're happy to answer any questions you might have on the br1 the br2 the the transit starlink any of the above we'll open it up I think looking at it we've got about eight viewers I'm wondering how many of those are mobile must have employees but that's a different topic um in the meantime yeah we could also talk about the promotion do you want to talk a little bit about the the special incentive deal we have for yeah so um I I love the transit as people probably are sick of hearing um but I I actually um took a swing at a pretty big purchase lot of those were through a little more than half of them already they've just been flying um but we do have some left and that that massive buy allowed us to to to get a little bit flexible we can't advertise on our site um necessarily that there's a lower price but for folks that are here uh we have a coupon code I think it's uh it's something that that if you go to our website you click on the promotions button you'll see uh it listed there and then you can hop in and that'll save you 200 bucks on Transit so that gets you to the to the 799 uh price point and if you look at the yeah that's a killer deal and then if you if you look at the ultimate Road Warrior bundle that bundle discount I think adds another two and a half percent it might even be a little more because I know they were coding some changes to the site long story short it'll stack with that discount so that can get you roof antenna DC power router uh the whole kit and caboodle so that's a cool one for those who are looking to to step it up a bit uh the br2 uh br2 has a peplink uh promotion running right now it's it's uh it's I think it was called buyer's remorse promotion and I was like don't call it that because they're going to think they're buying remorse of this uh but they're saying buyer's remorse if you bought something other than a peplink um okay that makes sense that makes more sense yeah I was like yeah it's fine um but long story short uh this device gets you a four hundred dollar uh uh discount uh if you're an existing peplum customer all you have to do is provide the serial number of your existing device we'll look it up boom you get the discount and you keep your device if uh you are not a peplink customer you can trade in any device you have anywhere I've got one right here um this is a 3G hotspot maybe a sport wow I haven't seen that shape in a long time but it has to do things right so this is eligible anything is eligible for that trading program and uh if you don't have anything like the requirement it just has to have a and what's the it's I forget the number the ESN number or Isn yeah IMEI so it has to be it has to be able to connect to the internet and be a a non-pep link but if you had a pep link you'd be fine too if you don't have one of these I'll sell you one for a dollar on our website and I'll give you 399 bucks back there you go I got a bunch of you you have heard it here that is that is very cool service or if you're in checkout just under where it asks for the click trade-in and we're asked for the serial number just say need Hotspot and we'll sell you one for a dollar and then be happy for you to trade it in after that yep yep so I wrote half the competition rules so I made sure that was allowed I think you know while while we're sit waiting to see if anyone has any questions I mean that's a pretty good point how closely do you really work with paplink at the end of the day when it comes to developing this sort of product roadmap um we work pretty closely with peplink so I'd say there are three or four you know that's not fair there's 10 really strong peplink Partners uh that I know of that that are actively involved in helping peplink be the best company that they can be um I think we are generally known as the the the RV um organization that works mostly with recreational vehicles I know Doug from onboard Wireless uh helps us out a lot on the Marine side I love Doug he's a great guy um we do Marine as well but but Doug you know has a lot more on the on the boat experience so there's a couple folks that that are in there but in terms of you know obviously we want peplink's partner of the Year this year and we're a platinum partner so we're we're at their top tier um and and once a month uh I'm on the phone with with the general manager who's effectively the president of the organization he was I think he was the second or third employee underneath Alex the CEO um and we talk about a lot of of challenges for the rvu space and what we want to see out of product development um the category 7 balance 20x was something we spent a lot of time on the category sevens in general we were like guys we have to get ban 71 for T-Mobile into this product line it's why the transits now are cat 7 cat 12. people are like why did they mix and match the modems because we asked them to we said guys we want a modem we want one modem that kicks butt on Verizon and T-Mobile and we want one modem that kicks butt on Verizon and at T what that meant is that both worked fine in Verizon and then the other two you could mix and match between what would really do well to give you maximum coverage and then the br2 was a multiple year conversation trying to tell them that we really really wanted to see a this device was fifteen thousand dollars before we got involved and now it's under three so that was something we were able to bring to the community through a lot of hard work and peplink just stepped up I can't say enough good things about them for doing that it's really cool yep yeah that's great well I I don't see any questions here in the comments so apparently we've answered everyone's question very successfully which is pretty cool I guess maybe that means we had the show plan written properly which is nice but um I'll just Pat myself on the back for that one um I only touched I only touched like two of those promos so go to mobilemostab.com click on the promotional button on the top right hand corner and we'll have our team put it on the link here on the bottom too just so that it shows up in the live stream just in case people are watching this delayed so it is um there's a lot of stuff in the vast majority of it is ending at the end of this month so you got eight days and it will be gone I've confirmed that with high ups that those promos are ending um I think the only one I know is sticking around is the uh the br1 mini kind of the entry level one is uh they've moved that from 479 down to 399 and that's going to be uh at least for now it's a permanent price change that's the cat seven entry level device that's in our full-timer bundle right right not the older Cat 4 version but the cat7 version yeah the cat7 is great 300 megabits down I think 150 Meg up more than enough for somebody who just wants to use the internet not think about it that's really what it's for we call it the full timer I think we're going to change the name to these uh the essentials bundle because people are like I'm not a full-timer I'm like you don't have to be a full-timer it's okay um I think Collette who's who's one of the live stream Watchers just commented that she has the uh the br1 mini Colette do you uh and I love the picture of the boats because that's pretty cool there too um yeah what uh what what if you want to comment if you don't have to by any means but what what do you what do you do on the road and and are you are you full-time or not we can solve this debate right now laughs and give her a second to respond but um yeah right we'll start doing a call-in show there we go we could do a Live tech support show how about that yeah no I know Andy can join that one uh and Mandy so uh one thing I will say is just just thanks to everybody and and please in the comments section put ideas for our Fireside Chats um we are running at a thousand miles an hour but we recognize and realize we just don't spend enough time talking to you guys we're you know we want to do more of stuff like this so that's uh that's exciting and we want to hear what topics you guys have out there that you want us to explore we're not experts in everything but we probably have opinions about most things yes yes yes we do also along those same lines I mean you know I I think it's it's worth noting we're going to start to have as part of this a feature highlight of customers that are willing to do it just to qualify that but um of customers that have used our products in sort of creative and interesting ways you know next week we're gonna try and have a highlight of One customer who's who's using coupling products for live streaming sports events I think is is just as a preview of what that might look like in addition to having Mike who is uh is is a big voice in this RV Community I think that's going to be a really cool guest for next week as well um you know if you do have feedback please share it here in the comments on either YouTube or on Facebook or any of our social media platforms we are on Instagram we are on Tick Tock um as much as Mike Gray beard says that we shouldn't be otherwise but um you know we are on all of the social medias if in in our

{"id": "qcU1q2aVij8", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "HLfhUF5-3F6oGehEYj0CItDlUHE", "transcript": "hey guys Eric from mobilemustave.com and I'm here with my Blue Water System including my portable water softener and today we're going to do a video on how to recharge the portable water softener come along with us and we'll tell you all about it [Music] now typically you have to recharge a water softener approximately every two to six weeks in a full-time RV living type situation I know that's a really broad range but it's highly dependent on the content of magnesium and calcium in the water in your location so if you're hanging out in like Southern Arizona where the content is very high you may be needing to recharge your softener as much as every two weeks and if you're in an area of the country where water is not that hard you might get yourself more like six or even possibly eight weeks it's important for you to test the water regularly to understand how your softener is performing and to do that you use water test strips like what I'm going to show you right here now there are varying degrees of water hardness typically if your water is harder than say 80 parts per million you may have difficulty with like detergents working really effectively or setting up you know with those bubbles as effectively as possible if you start to creep past 120 that's when you start might you start kind of having build up in your pipes and you might start causing damage to some of your appliances and if you're north of like 250 which is really really hard that's when it's virtually impossible to use a dishwasher or any Appliance without there just being film all over everything and it just kind of being a bad experience so a water softener takes care of all of those things so right here I've got some water softening test strips they come in a little container like this they're not very expensive we can send you a link on where you can pick these up we don't sell them directly because they're just so simple we you could just pick them up anywhere Amazon is an easy spot to get them when you're picking up other kind of Essentials and these little strips contained inside of these have a small test area there you can see it's yellow and if you look on the side of the container that yellow corresponds to basically as soft a water as possible zero parts per million of calcium and magnesium that's soft water if you go all the way to the other side over here you've got a thousand parts per million and that's your your dark red color there to test you just drop this into the water for about three seconds and then give it you know 10 15 seconds to to change color you want to view the color up against this scale within one minute otherwise we might get a false reading that it's a little harder than it actually is so you want to typically look within one minute your test strips may have slightly different instructions just read the instructions on the bottle but that's going to give you a baseline now for me I like to Baseline right out of my softener here and test here not blasting water on this that can give you a false reading just filling up a small cup of water dipping it in and then looking to see where I'm at the reason why I don't test up in the RV is because during the flushing process and everything there may be water inside the pipes that hasn't fully softened yet so if you're just testing here you really know what you're up against and how much improvement your regeneration cycle has given you all right so one thing to mention before we get started with recharging the softener another thing that you want to do about once a season if you're kind of a casual camper or if you're a full-timer probably once every three months or so is to do something called a back flush and you want to do that before you do the recharge or regen system so how you do a recharge is super simple we're just going to flip the system around and I don't have it with me but as you can see here you can't connect these together um now this is a very close uh version of what you'll see in the bag of the softener and this is this allows you to basically back flush the system now what you're going to do is connect this to here connect the hose up to here now you're in the back flush scenario you're going to turn on the water for five full minutes once that back flush is done you flip it back around and you start the regen process let's get started with what you need to do the Regeneration process you need one of these which is 26 ounces of table salt I would get yourself a couple of these travel with them and if you have neglected your softener for more than the recommended amount of time you may have to run your regen cycle twice so you're going to need two of these in that case and you do have to run them twice you can't just pour twice as much salt in there and get get a result at least I haven't found that works really well so but for right now we're going to attempt to do one softening and see how we do we need that because I know my softener has has gone a little bit longer than normal I'm going to also use a pitcher here filled with warm water and then I've also got myself a yardstick here made out of aluminum you could honestly use a stick but you don't want to contaminate your resin with something organ organic like that so I like to use this and I'll show you what I'm going to do with that in a little bit all right so Step One is we're going to turn off the water source we're going to turn off our water pump and then we're going to turn on our exterior or interior faucets and let all the water drain out so that when I go to disconnect this quick connect it's not under high pressure okay now that we've removed the water pressure we're going to go ahead and remove both of these hoses like that from both sides and we're going to take the softener and carefully tip it on its side we're not going to turn it all the way upside down just tip it on its side and allow the water to drain out of the inlet port just like this now we don't have to get all of the water out of the system we're just trying to get a good amount of it out so that when we do pour the salt into the system to recharge it that it is going to fully absorb and coat those uh those resin beads completely to make sure that we can really remove all of that magnesium and calcium and give us a nice good recharge one thing to note if you did tip the device over a hundred percent what can happen is the resin can actually coat the threads of the top and it can make it difficult for it to unscrew completely if that happens never force it don't try to you know if it's not unscrewing or screwing typically there's a reason for that so if that does happen to you just tighten it back up and then fill it back up with water get it all the way filled and then just swish it around a little bit that will clean off the threads of the head and make sure that it can unscrew nice and easy because I've tipped this over nice and soft I suspect it's going to come off really easily now that our water is pretty much done let's go ahead and get that done now that's what we want to see came right off nice and easy and when we bring this out we're going to see resin they look like little gold beads and they will be kind of all over the place and we just want to make sure they stay in there we're going to take this head and just set it off on the side like that and let's just keep that somewhere where it's not going to get dirty all right next we're going to take our salt and we're going to go ahead and open that up and pour that whole guy in there alrighty now that our Salt's in we're going to go ahead and pour in our warm water now you may have noticed when I was pouring that salt that I got a little bit on the rim on the edges where the threads are to the water softener make sure that while you're pouring this in just to save yourself some time you go ahead and rinse off those threads if you see anything on them that might impede your ability to tighten this once you're all done and you're ready to put everything back together all right so this is a step that is maybe just the mobile must-have stuff I've had softeners for quite a while this is typically never in the instructions from the manufacturer but I am world renowned for forgetting to recharge my softeners so I like to take my yardstick here again made out of aluminum not something you know super organic like wood or whatnot and just get that salt solution all over my resin on all the different sides now for me what I like to do at this point is I start a timer and I go ahead and wait five minutes just to allow that salt to really absorb in to those resin crystals to clean them off and get rid of all that magnesium and calcium if you're better than I am and you recharge on a regular basis you can most likely skip this step all right it's been about five minutes I've just put that over the cover to make sure nothing goes in there and contaminates my system while I waited now we're ready to reassemble the system so we're going to go ahead and put the head right back in now I like to turn the head one full turn until I hear that click sometimes it's less than a full turn and that tells me it's ready to thread in the other direction Lefty Loosey righty tighty just like every other screw you have on your RV so we're going to go ahead and tighten that up and it should be nice and easy to turn if for some reason it's not Don't Force It just go back the other way clean off those threads and everything will be easy Once you meet some resistance you're going to be looking at about a quarter turn till you've given it a nice seal don't over tighten it it'll just make your life a lot harder the next time you go to take everything apart next we're going to attach our Inlet supply hose to the inlet side and we are going to turn on the water very very low just about like an eighth of a turn just to get the water coming out now instructions typically tell you that you want the stream of water to be about the diameter of a pencil the way I like to do it is I just look for the water to just barely clear the edge of the of the canister that's just an easy way for me to know that I've got the right amount of flow all right I like that that's a nice good pencil size stream now the manual typically says about 15 minutes for a 10 000 grain softener I like to do it 20 or 25 minutes maybe I'm wasting some of my soft water but what I don't want is a salty tasting water inside of the coach and typically the first thing that gets hit is like the ice maker and I'm like oh salty ice cubes so I like to just add some time to this process to make sure that the water coming out of here is nice and ready to go one more tip while you're doing this you can turn on your water pump inside your RV giving everyone else inside access to the water that's in your fresh water tank that way you don't feel rushed and they've got water all right my timer is going off we're going to hit stop on that we ended up with doing the 25 minutes I know I said 20 25 but I like to do it a little bit longer just to make sure that we've got a good flush and you can just tell that was cloudy white salty water now it's nice and clear looking good next step is we're going to turn this on full power now they say to do it for you know two to three minutes every single time I do it two to three minutes when I go to check at the very end my last step is I take a sip of this make sure it doesn't taste too salty I'm usually dealing with a little bit of salt that might be because I like to uh to to get my salt um you know warmed up with the warm water and diluted fully I'm not really sure but we're going to go ahead and run this for five full minutes at full power one more thing make sure you're running a pressure regulator at the base here especially when you're running something full output like this just to make sure you don't have any damage I've seen some RV parks where they've got like water cisterns up on a hill and they're getting 100 PSI water pressure at some of the sites just just have a pressure regulator it's a super smart move and obviously it's going to protect your RV pipes as well all right we're bringing that down to a trickle and we're going to start by taking a nice clean cup and we're going to test our water right now with a test strip and see how we did all right so as you can see there we've we haven't had as much improvement as I as I I would want to to call this a wrapped up job and that's pretty common actually I see when I neglect this system oftentimes I can move from where we started which you see there that's 250 uh to where we are right now which is kind of in the 1 120 180 range so we're going to repeat the process again just like we saw there and uh we'll see how we do on the second one all right so we're just wrapping up our uh our second flush got another clean cup here we're going to test that again let's see how we do nice all right so we are now officially uh with soft water so the last test I'm going to do is I'm going to fill this up and just give it a taste I mean if you're drinking water after all right tastes good no salt taste at all and obviously I have my Blue Longevity 0.2 Micron and tasty filter here which is why I'm perfectly comfortable drinking the water in my RV I don't need to do bottled water or anything else we're ready to go let's get the system hooked back up and welcome to having soft water all right I'm all hooked up just gonna turn on my water to make sure my water pump is off which it is as always if you have any questions you can hop over to mobilemustab.com and you can start up a chat in the bottom right hand corner you can also if you have any questions or problems with this you can schedule a consultation with one of our experts at talk.mobilemustave.com and as always you can reach us via email at info mobilemustave.com I'm ready to go have a cocktail thanks all

saw this new software new software new things yeah oh it's just checking all of the background stuff it's like Okay cool so yeah we're getting set up here a little tip getting tips and tricks all over the places we're like opening things up see I can see a couple things looks like we have somebody here oh so yeah I'm actually a follower um HD from above nice to have you join us thank you for joining this is um really honestly going to be a test of the software for us you've got me here you've got Eric we're going to talk about Transit pros and peplink in a minute um but we wanted to just kind of jump in real quick and see what we're doing oh and it's you okay HD nice that is that's Dave I'm wondering if I can see there's 14 people viewing overall so um nice okay we've got we do have banners we can do on the side so Eric I think one um I'm looking kind of on the side buttons and stuff one question I had is we get a lot of questions of like what we should buy like what someone should buy that's like our number one question around the internet and so it's a big question right because there's there's like how much money you got how much money you got but then like what do you needed to do because that's a huge part were you like working or you were tired like there's a huge range that that question can get asked but we do have probably a couple devices that we always typically lean towards and one of them um is the transit Pro uh and it's a dual modem device so could you quickly kind of go over what the transit Pro device is like what it has from a feature standpoint and then um talk about some of its best use cases yeah I mean it's kind of an interesting kind of time that we're in right now I think what we're seeing is a you know we're all getting kind of bombarded and destroyed with with marketing around 5G and cellular 5G or fifth generation cellular so that's um that's kind of where everybody's mentally thinking they want to be you know they're like oh 5G 5G is fast blazing fast you're seeing all these commercials that are coming out and talking about it and um you know you and I have 5G in our RVs in our setups by the way I'm in I'm in the studio right now so we're in the middle of building a bunch of uh of our of our cool little suitcase uh internet Solutions called tough signals that they're uh why it's such a mess back there we're going crazy but that's where I am um so so my RV's that way over there a little bit right outside that door um we just got back from almost three months out on the road so it's a blast but we have 5G right so you know a lot of people are like well then if you have 5G we have five you know that's what we want and you know getting back to your question around the transit um the transit's not a 5G device so it's it's an interesting question the way you asked it and I kind of want to answer it almost in a in a little bit of a different way to say you know what what would my kind of levels of what's most important be for mobile connectivity because 5G is not the first one it's like the probably the third one I would say um and depending on what people's budgets are you can step into 5G but there's stuff that's more important before that so that's why the transit kind of comes into play for a lot of customers so I think the big if we if we look at kind of the the different pebbling products or you know products that we sell that are out there a big thing that we want customers to be thinking about is how many modems or kind of connections to different cellular providers that device can support right it's sort of I mean the analogy when I'm doing like these big talks and we're doing fireside chats with you know kind of like the uh the new uh folks that are you know they just bought their RV and they're going to like the the rally for the um right you know for the for the manufacturers is and you know they're all kind of you know kind of glossed over like what do I do I just want to stay connected we sit down and we talk to them we say look you could have a super fast you know two-wheel drive car like a Ferrari and I'm like do any of you guys own Ferraris and occasionally I get one or two but the vast majority are like no they're like we think it's super cool and I'm like what does everybody drive and when I ask folks what they drive it's like 90 plus percent are in some type of sedan or or SUV or truck and they're all four-wheel drive and I'm like well why do you have a four wheel drive truck and they're like well it's just much more versatile to me it's much more reliable I can drive it in different weather conditions I can do all these things it's kind of a funny analogy because your internet connectivity is very similar so you know everybody comes to us our number one product right now that we sell is a 5G modem it's our single right modem 5G it's called the VR1 Pro right yeah yeah the br1 pro 5G and um it's priced ironically at the same price as a Transit so they're both 9.99 products and when people ask us which one to choose the first question we ask is well what what other internet source do you have besides cellular and some customers are like oh it's starlink and I'm like get the br1 pro 5G if those are your two things that you have starlink and you'll want a cellular backup that br1 Pro can combine them together boom you got yourself four wheel drive you have two connections if one fails you're still up and running and you're you're you're not you know dropping out calls and and having problems um if they don't have starlink or they're like I'm interested in in the most reliable possible connection um and I don't want to break the bank we say we start to look at well the transit even though it's not 5G it has two cellular modems in it that are pretty fast pretty capable 4G modems and for me I would always hands down 100 of the time take two modems 4G or 5G over one and uh well I mean I'm like I'm here in Traverse City and I'm getting 100 down on LGE LT is not slow no and it's funny because it's almost getting faster because every device and every person and every iPhone is 5G now so the carriers are pushing out 5G and keep in mind 4G I mean we retired 3G after 20 plus years of service So 4G is going to be here for I would guess 15 years you know maybe maybe a little bit less but um the you know it's just it's a very usable capable band that can go far and do a lot for folks and it has you know in you know very high like you said 100 megabit you know speeds yeah yeah so you know I think that's really what it comes down to it's like be careful just picking one so and people are always like well how come there's not a dual 5G and I'm like it's 2800 it's it's funny we're here since I'm building all these products I'll step away from the camera right now but I can actually show you know a bunch of this stuff and we can kind of show kind of the difference because I think this is where people get really tripped up so this is a dual 5G it's called the br2 this is like our Flagship Big Mama this is but this is I mean it's got everything this router has everything you want yeah yeah dual 5G you've got a USB port here which means you can plug in a third 5G so you got three 5g's you got two Wan ports so you can plug two starlinks into it plus virtual Wan would give you a third and um because there's a USB modem too yeah USB as well yeah right no it's sorry I'm getting uh my my three-year-old dropped my my watch last night so it no longer uh it no longer vibrates so it's like dinging in my hair because I was like I better get better turn on my alerts so I just turn them off yeah so but if you look you've got eight cellular antennas to get two 5G modems so that's really where you get yourself that's what people don't really understand is oh 5G means four antennas and with 4G typically your two antennas per modem for you know cat 12 or for what I mean they do have four antennas for like the category 20s but for the vast majority of customers who are looking to just look at you know one nice easy single roof antenna you're typically doing like a seven in one roof antenna here's a here's a dual modem and like as you can see there modem one modem two um so it just vastly simplifies the installation and it drops the price down by half to go dual 4G versus um versus dual 5G and I just wouldn't do single 5G unless unless my like unless I didn't work like if if I just needed it maybe for downloading because what you know like Netflix will buff it'll download big bursts of traffic and you may not buffer but but yeah even for gaming people will feel like they need faster speeds for gaming and I'm like no you need you need the reliability of you know potentially something like speed Fusion where because if you're gaming and it drops out because you've got that millisecond of you know latency Spike or something you're gonna have a better experience over LTE with speed Fusion which we haven't got into yet but you're gonna have that it's just gonna be a better experience overall you're not going to really give up much on on the speed side of it yeah exactly and and we frequently see because we travel with you know a couple different modems but I'll see one carriers got really fast upload and one's got really fast download so you know when you when you have those and you have the benefit of speed Fusion like you said we'll get into that at some point that's the ability to bond the connections together into one connection you can kind of get the benefits of the download and the upload on whichever one's faster um so that's just for me it's like it's it's the number one conversation I have with people they start out saying I just need 5G and I say okay you know what else do you need like forget about the product tell me what you need they're like I just need it to be reliable I don't want to think about it I want it to just work while I'm driving I don't want to have to fuss with it when I go set up camp um that's the number one thing people get into starlink they're like they're moving it's like boom there's like how many YouTube videos are there like people driving over starlinks people are stealing starlinks it's like oof so yeah I have a star like into your RV somehow yeah well I'm gonna like route the cable every time I mean to me it's like I there are so many times I'm driving and I just don't want to set up anything I just want to either I'm in a rush or the kids want to watch TV as soon as they get somewhere I'm trying to keep the baby busy you know and so we're like just set up something so to go and set up your internet every time such a pain like just to be able to walk in there's so much other stuff I gotta set up I gotta set up water I gotta set up sewer I gotta I gotta put my slides out I have a level I've got to actually Park and make sure that and now with two kids it's super fun because Kayla's not really she's managing the kids while I'm driving so I don't have a spotter anymore so you know and to sit there and after all that's done you know go pitch a tent it's like it's not gonna happen so but like I said I have starlink I just I have a fixed Mount starlink I know a lot of other people have done some really cool stuff where they're like modding their starlinks to be fixed Mount but who knows how long Elon will allow that to to exist you know and um and you know either way but it's just one leg to the stool for me it's because I'd say sixty percent of the time the starlink doesn't work for me because I park under a tree I am three three out of my last four weeks and I've been under trees so yeah I haven't had Starling gone so I'm gonna pay for a Starlight this month and you're gonna get it it's love it's love hate right because it's well you get emotion in in our dishes so that's nice um well yeah yeah for another month yeah turning that off yeah yeah we've I've heard grumblings of of of that um yeah but uh well yeah this is you there is you still will be able to get it it's just not going to be in the realm plan like it initially was um but this is just this is an excellent first task to just kind of want to jump in I can see a message from Katie that she had this whole 5G conversation with our Consulting Group and they went Transit 12. so okay that's awesome if anybody did have a question you can post it quickly into comments we can talk about it but if you if we don't I promise we'll um follow up and we'll message you or something back if we see it come over um but yeah this was a quick test kind of of this we are going to start doing more of these kind of live streams working on the schedule um and so if you've got topics you'd like discuss you can put those in the comments um and yeah so just let us know overall uh we're going to be posting kind of a schedule and and more more coming out we're going to call these the Fireside Chats we're thinking um but yeah um any closing I just leave let's I'll just leave any closing remarks Eric if we have any questions that might come in just in case yeah no I actually I have one I have one we are running I have a secret discount code for the transit Pros running it's called Andy's Secret sale so if you're watching this stream Andy's Secret sale is the coupon code all one word um and I'm gonna get you uh 200 off the transit Pro so if you're interested haven't bought one yet um I do have that secret code kind of running from a marketing side if anybody's looking um so we did you know this was just a test so we've covered very little but a couple other high level points for folks if they are interested in a device is make sure you also check out the processor that's in the device so if you're going to be plugging in starlink or T-Mobile home or anything because peplinks make an exceptionally good Hub or kind of Central Command Center for all these various internet connections that you can pick up all over the place um and the the transit Pro is kind of the unsung hero people don't really know that it was when it was refreshed last year they put a very fast processor and it's actually faster than the than the br1 pro 5G the br1 so yeah yeah so if you're if you're dealing with uh with starlink with multiple cellular and they did it because they knew oh look people are going to plug all these things into this device we need to make sure it's got some horsepower to Route all this traffic yeah it's got dual modems and everything yeah yeah so it's a great question yeah we're doing one question so Kim was I'm asking the difference between the 2271 and the Husky if you'd like to talk about that quickly yes the pointing seven and one I think what's super cool about it is it's mounting options so right out of the box at a really aggressive price point you get um you get the ability to have the wires go straight down from the antenna or out in the back of the antenna the to allow for a surface mount installation if you were going into like an existing junction box for solar or something else um so it's a it's a solid antenna that has done really well at a pretty aggressive price point it kind of put us on the map it was the first antenna that we started selling and uh it is a nice kind of I don't want to call it low end but it's kind of a low end antenna it's also used by Airstream in their Airstream connect products um so that's you know you might see them out there stepping up to the Husky the Husky is made by parsec in in Dallas or Plano Texas and it was developed and built for First Responders so if you want to know who's using that antenna a t firstnet they're actual like employees are using that antenna so the first that's like the first responder network uh Verizon's first responder units they're using that antenna the California Highway Patrol is using that antenna that antenna was developed for people who said to parsec hey look I'm in a situation where I may be extremely remote and in a situation where I do not have signal on my phone uh can you build us an antenna that's going to get us the furthest possible range possible that's really what the Husky is and what they did there's some kind of proprietary Tech in there I can't get too into it but it's a slightly directional element inside the Husky there's four elements in there each one covers like I don't know it's about 120 degrees so it's more than a 90 degree spectrum and each element is essentially slightly pointing in one direction to give it really Mega range now even though it is slightly pointed in One Direction um it it is an omnidirectional antenna so it sees on all sides but it's been a top top performer like everyone who uses it is just like I can't believe I'm getting four bars when my phone has half or no bar you know yeah so Kim just said so she actually had the pointing on her first RV they're selling that so now she's trying to figure out what to put on the new RV I mean and Kim the question I've had the pointy installed I'm in the same RV that you ever saw the install video for it's this RV still in it but I have put on a husky in addition um they're both super solid antennas um you're gonna ask us just straight out of the box performance wise the husk is going to be a little bit better um but they're both really going to be beneficial and way better than kind of the antennas that come with and with it the install is almost identical too it's just kind of the point is going to be a little smaller um husky is a little bit bigger it's like 10 inches um but they both install the same way they're both really really good antennas yeah if you were price sensitive to the Husky which is understandable it's up there um I'd say the best antenna bang for the buck is the um probably the pep link uh Mobility 42g which comes in at a nice kind of respectable I think eight inches in size seven or eight inch diameter um comes with a pull mount adapter if you needed it it's good for Van lifers who want to mount it to a rack um performance really good husky is still going to beat it in most situations um but I I think it's a step up from the the pointing in a performance perspective the pointing has a slight directionality to it because it's like long and thin that we kind of found that when we started turning it it would perform better this way like out the sides and that's kind of understandable based on how it looks um metal so the rounder antennas tend to be more balanced we've got a couple more questions so the next one is I'm going to show the screen too so this is from Tim they camp in remote areas um hard to get signal they've been looking for some help stay connected with the homeschool um so Tim I think the first is um I mean that's what a lot of our bundles do if you're looking for more of a rural home more stable optionally or not so mobile we've got those um we also have like the bundles in General on our site are designed specifically for this getting an antenna high up on the roof or high anywhere can be beneficial um I would reach out and set up a Consulting call with some of our consultants and they can give you specific examples based on your need and your use case uh the transit product like we talked about today I've got that 200 off um Andy's Secret sale coupon code so you can use that and we can get the right antenna based on how you want to install it or where you're going to use it or if you want to go back and forth so I would do it yeah I would also Tim check out the uh the Akita uh omnidirectional antenna from parsec it's a pole mounted antenna that performs extremely well it's a flat panel antenna it looks like you're supposed to point it at something but it's actually an omnidirectional antenna if you get that up over your roof um and you have marginal signal outside you'll see some pretty serious improvement with that antenna uh routers I think the transit with that coupon is is probably the best bang for your buck out there that's just a crazy deal um I think the balance 20x is uh if you want to step down into category seven and a single modem but have some expandability uh it's a nice product I think that's 479 but yeah that's not bad but for me I would pair it I would consider pairing it if you want really reliability for homeschooling and zoom and everything consider pairing it with a starlink because the starlink is not going to do it I just did a two weeks with starlink alone uh because I was in a zero cell area and um my DSL that I have for backup went out and starlink is I was like wow I've never just used only starlink and it's very frustrating it's not for this type of stuff for zoom and whatnot so star link is uh is a good pairing though with like a Cellular Connection I think if you did those two yeah get on Consulting we can send you links directly we can definitely hook you up so so let me see if you got questions there um yeah it's locked up yeah exactly um against this one real quick from Tracy so the p800 um we actually have a new upgraded plan it's the p1000 it's a slightly different plan on the back end from T-Mobile they changed the wholesale side of it um so it it kind of depends so that's really where T-Mobile's going um yeah so we've got an alternative option than than for the p800 yeah it's kind of kind of weird our plans are provisioned with static IP and like they sort of ran out of ips and then they stopped working reliably with peplinks just to give people kind of a sneak peek so we we scooted with them and found some business plans that turned into the p1000 so that plan is it's a better plan over all the people seems to be getting better upload and download speeds too for folks around p800 it's probably worth taking a look at the uh the option uh so reach out for anyone for anyone joining yeah because I think we we're offering some promos for folks around the 800s that want to move to 1000s for like um reach out to the guys on chat um and they'll look up make sure you're all set um and and one last thing is that they can keep you can keep your existing Sim you have to go down for like a few hours but if they can reuse the SIM okay yeah so um next one is um Phil has a MK2 and a pointing Soldier RV yeah so Phil the one you want is the Doberman If You're Gonna Keep the MK2 um that is a really good pointing five and one kind of replacement however if you wanted to go and on your new rig do something like the Husky which is a seven in one that would allow that antenna to be 5G ready or so if you ever wanted to go dual modem or 5G in the future you're you already have an antenna for it so you could do a seven and one now and kind of future proof yourself uh but if you wanted to stay specifically for the five and one the parsec doberman's a good choice you can still go with the pointing five and one two same antenna that's a great option too yeah I would I would definitely look at the uh look at the seven and one antennas one other note is technically you can connect these together with an ethernet cable and something called Synergy mode so if you were potentially thinking of upgrading what folks have done including what Andy did in his last videos he'll show you that he's got this but he took his old device and connected it in to give him extra modems so you could leave the Mr the MK2 in the secondary position and have you know your primary and your secondary and it'll all show up on One dashboard so you'll you'll see your both routers all it'll just add to the connections that you can drag and drop on the dashboard it's a super cool feature yeah I'll post that video link bearing chap so whichever whatever you're following I still see that comes back in but definitely I would I would go with a seven and one antenna if I was just for the future proofing of it unless you're not planning on keeping the RV then yeah the doberman's a great little low profile antenna but it does work better with a ground plane we got plenty of articles on that yeah so and then Kim just came back about the Magnum so it came for the magma with the Husky so the Husky is the big round antenna the magma is an option without the 90 amount it mounts exactly the same as the pointing so hole in the roof big sticker you stick it down um and then you die for the edge that is the standard kind of flat Mount way to to mount the Husky if you wanted to do the magnet Mount it's designed for a van that might have ridges on the roof or different options so it'll just kind of stick down I actually put a magnet mount on the top of my fifth wheel um I just put basically a metal plate down I glued it down with silicone and stuck it on I just didn't want to do another hole in my roof and then the wires I ran through an existing cable drop for solar I already had I was already doing solar so it really depends on if you have another entry point already for cables and the magnet mount's a great option if you don't then kind of flat mounting it is perfect too so they're they're both options but no mag amount same as the pointing in the install standpoint which can be helpful yeah just note you know a lot of people get tripped up with our ground planes because they're aluminum and that's not magnetic so if you are going to want to stick it down to a piece of metal just go get a piece of galvanized steel um Home Depot should have that just about any you know if you type in like fabricator or metal work someone can cut you one the ideal sort of size would be like if you want Mega range 24 by 24 Square that's the best that you can do but anything uh you know 16 inches or better will improve your signal and we sell round ground planes because they look better and people like them um but if you do a square you may you may Edge your performance just a little bit the the points on the ground plane will actually help improve your signal just a smidge not it's not a huge amount but if you're cutting the metal you might as well go Square all right and then last question I see and if anybody else has a question we'll just follow up with you I promise um but Dennis is asking about the OB set up in the in control um this is definitely your world if you uh I think is he trying to like share setups across or share configs across multiple peplinks um I don't know what that is so Dennis if you could either comment more or um you can shoot us an email at info mobilemusstaff.com just say I was watching the live stream I've got a quick question um Eric and I will get back to you for sure uh we can follow up with you exactly what that is if you are talking about Synergy mode which is hey I just want to see these all on One dashboard uh we have a Synergy uh video which um is pretty simple to do you factory reset your secondary device and then you plug it in to the WAN Port of your primary device and the Lan Port of your secondary device the one that you just factory reset and then um what about outbound policy could it be the outbound policy Senate but it wouldn't be they both have the same setup I think you just have to set them up the same ones you um yeah I'd need more to kind of know what what does send us more and we'll follow up with you for sure make sure you get make sure you get your answers there yeah so it probably is outbound policy but to him so he said no it's two separate running vehicles and so outbound policy on two separate vehicles oh okay so he's trying to use outbound policy in in control to set everything up so yeah it's like a great policy yeah so um hold on let me see yeah so you basically get the devices into a group inside of in control and then at the group level you apply the outbound policies so um the best way to do it is to um create yeah yeah so you inside the group you go up to network settings once you've created the group outbound policy you turn on manage outbound policy and then you create what's called a rule set and that's almost exactly the same as if you were creating it locally on the router so you add a rule it's all the same things you name that rule but then you can tell it to um once you create the rules you can then tell it where to apply the rules so typically what you'd want to select is apply to any router with the following tag and you just make up the tag you know whatever routers and then inside of the the default list of your routers you click edit and then you'll see a little pop-up there where you can check the boxes of the various devices and then you click add tag and when you add the tag um it basically will add it to the router and your policy is tied to the tag so it'll know to only roll out that policy on routers that have the tag that really lets you kind of set everything up without it deploying to all of your routers and then you can test it with one by just adding the tag and um and you're good to go so it will um will be uh this and and just one thing to throw in here this is a great thing we talk about a lot with the Merck group so if you're a member an Explorer member of mobilemustav.com you get access to the forums with mobile RV internet.com and The Merck group there where this is like a big topical lots of topics are big and discuss there but that can be a great place to ask questions like this too and you're going to get community input Eric and Dave kind of follow those and answer those forms directly and three or four times a week I get a curveball like that hey I need to set up all these outbound policies and we can we that's nice because we can do a thread uh inside the Forum and then I can send screenshots to Dave because we've got a lot of customers that are doing exactly what he's trying to do mostly like Fleet Management and other folks that just need to roll out so you can do your vlans your outbound policies your wireless networks um just about everything that I can think of you can pre-configure in in control and then as soon as that device hops online it'll grab the config and roll it all out you can even set up a a config file by device model that just sits up there with like all of the settings you want and it'll actually go grab the config file and just download every setting every little Nuance or tweak that you had in that file based on uh based on on the settings that you choose uh that's called the bulk configurator that's where you do that inside of in control so many buttons I'm like let me get the right word for it yeah it's RV uh well I mean honestly yeah you join our membership and that gets you access to Merck which is RV mobile internet.com and then right when you log in you'll see the peplink forums and that's where you post that fun stuff that we we moderate yeah cool all right well like I said in the beginning this was just kind of a test of our systems and our Tech in this new streaming device Andy I thought no one was going to show up to this call I would have cleaned up and vacuumed behind me I guess I guess a few folks who are here so that was so cool to let's do more of these yeah so we'll do some more we'll start posting schedules and I'm gonna post a couple of topics we're going to start with but I mean we're looking a lot from the community but do you guys want to know from us too so we'll post a form somewhere and kind of share that so if you guys are interested in and asking specifically what to cover um we'll do that too so yeah the email email in the email in those questions that info must have that the support team will route them to us because we need ideas for what to cover in the Fireside Chats and I think we'll always kind of have some sneaky deals coming on here oh that's the plan yeah special deals come up cool awesome cool all right thank you everybody for joining and we hope to see everybody out on the road so thank you so much

{"id": "dgWv-67bIFo", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "V5KnpimyXlbTT1bHm3HG06Ht4Yk", "transcript": "okay all right guys hi this is Andy from one must have now in this video I wanted to go over realistic speeds and what I'm seeing in a campground where I just pulled in and I have zero bars on my phone or maybe I have one bar it's kind of going in between and how we're going to work while here with our peplink and our bundle system so come along with me I'll show you how our internet is connected this week and let's get to it now we just pulled into this Campground it's a KOA in Saint Ignace Michigan that's kind of right at the top of the midden of Michigan before you go into the up actually just after you get into up uh we're on that slide and we're going to Mackinac Island this week we're really excited about visiting that place uh but when I got here I was a little concerned because I kind of looked at my phone and it said no service so I was like cool I've got a full work week kind of up a hand we're going to try and do um you know some some tourism things overall but how am I going to stay connected while I'm here I didn't really look into anything but I switched over to the Wi-Fi right off the pep Link in our internet system and then I was getting 90 megabytes down so I immediately kind of like okay I guess we're going to be fine um so I wanted to dive into like what my solution is and how that's working for me even when I have no cell phone service on my phone directly because we're relatively remote kind of out you know in the up of Michigan uh so first let's just talk quickly about kind of expectations here so I'm going to show you my setup this is what I use every day this is something that we sell in our store and I'll link to all the products throughout the video and other videos we've got uh but this is just going to be kind of how I have my setup setup this is like realistic life of Andy in the RV and what um I have set up for my family that said though I can't guarantee these speeds are going to be which you see if you come if there's more RVs the networks could be more or less saturated they could have fixed something there could be Tower issues now or later I don't know but this is just kind of what I'm seeing in this particular place at this time and it's pretty realistic to what I see traveling around so it's not that this is someplace particularly special other than it actually works perfectly for this video because I don't have cell phone service so it kind of really highlights how well these antennas work even when your phone isn't connected so let's kind of dive into that um and we'll start there so the next thing that's really worth talking about and showing is the roof I'll show you kind of the simple roof antenna we've got up there that is really doing a lot of this work for us and I'll show you the starlink antenna I have up there and kind of how that all is like plugged together oh so bright uh how that's all plugged together down um inside so we'll get to that point but let's show the roof first you'll see how that's kind of all connected and then we'll go inside and show you the rest so Up on the Roof I have kind of a couple things that are critical to staying connect as we travel the first one is going to be right there and that is the parsec husky antenna that is a seven in one which means it's got 5G LTE it's got a GPS and Wi-Fi all built in perfectly paired honestly to the peplink device and that's the main thing that is keeping us connected here it's got really good range look we're so high up um just being on top of an RV roof already and then putting big pieces of metal outside high up in the air that is really what's the magical piece to getting cell connectivity and then next to that right in the middle of the roof we have our uh starlink antenna so it's going to be the high performance flat Mount Edition there's no moving Parts I never have to set it up it is mounted flat on the roof it's drilled directly in and uh yeah so it's always on it's always working as soon as we basically stop it it finds basically Sky up above it and will get connected now I don't like drilling a ton of holes in my roof I did have to drill that in just to mount it but the cables it wasn't convenient for me to put a cable wipe through that particular part of the roof so these cables even for the starlink that kind of comes around the other way um all basically feed into this box here so they all come in all of these other cables here are for my solar so they're all feeding down into one basically one pipe that's going down into where I need it to go so some of it's going into the basement Bay some of it's going I'm kind of peeling it off into where the routers are which you'll see in a second but yeah that's kind of the main the main juice behind um a lot of the success I have getting connectivity is going to be these high roof mount antennas that are just going to be 14 feet or 13.8 feet up in the air and allowed to get connectivity outside and that's going to be a key point now getting off the roof is always exciting and always gets your heart rate up a little bit so let's continue down we'll head in design and I'll show you the pebbling side of things where all of these wires are now going okay so this is kind of my secret little compartment where I have stored all of my stuff now this is my general techno so it's more than just Internet it's more than what we have here it's also where it has like my TV brain and my Apple TV and other things so there's a lot going on but the main system here that's kind of controlling really a lot of the tech in this RV is going to be my peplink Max uh br2 Pro it is kind of the main brain's mind everything everything else is linked into this and uh so that's kind of the main system so just a quick overview here I'm gonna have this br2 Pro is the center I've got a Max br1 a peplink Max br1 plugged into it so that is a third modem for me and then I also have this Max adapter which I just thrown in that is going to be another five Gene rodents I have four 5G cell modems connected to this one particular device that is all controlled in one place and then I've also dropped Star Lincoln now from starlink it's really just going to be an Ethernet that comes in here but you can see that power station that is powering basically the ethernet all the way up to starlink itself so that's what you see down here and that's why I needed so many different power options in this particular place now on top of that I have routed a particular 12 volt to Poe switch so this is a very special switch we sell on our store and it is designed to take just 12 volt power from your house battery convert it to at least 48 sometimes 52 volts to give you Poe and what I needed that for was putting in more access points that's not what this video is about but if you see the switch that's what that's for that's actually going to be a 12 volt Poe switch which we have found very very beneficial to have this is the behind the scenes but let's dive into the admin console where you can actually see the connections what are we using are we using a t Verizon T-Mobile you'll be able to see that all in the admin console so let's jump over to that all right guys so let's dive into the admin console now this can be used on a tablet on a phone it's easiest to record on a computer so that's why I'm doing it this way today but honestly a lot of times I'll do this on my phone just after we kind of set up to check everything um but this is going to be kind of the general setup I'm looking at when I first get to a particular Campground um a lot of times what I'll do is I'll just pull up a speed test app and I'll just run the speed test to see really how the speeds are if they're good and solid I'll just kind of leave them where they are and not necessarily mess with any particular settings to see 30 40s in the 50s and I've seen it up to 80 in this particular Campground and I think I have 120 the first day we were here I'm just going to leave this this is a very healthy connection for us we're also in the middle of the day where other people might be working and using that so yeah there's a good chance it's saturated in the evening might get a little slower when more people turn on Netflix and stuff but this is a pretty this is a really good really good connection for us considering all we've got now to kind of dive into some details though up at the top these are all of my active connections that I'm currently using to stay connected so we've got starlink as an option we see we've got two selpha or two cellular options which is T-Mobile and ATT are connected and then this is that LinkedIn one that br1 Pro I have linked over to the VR2 so you can see I have full control of what that is I can see what it is I can I can see how we're connected and this is my actual bar of service so remember I have zero to maybe one bar was flickering on my phone we're seeing three bars of service on team mobile and if I click in I can actually see kind of the strength of that connection I can see what band we're connected to so we get a lot of data here through the peplink let's say for example though one of them wasn't working very well I have lots of options I can continue to use since I'm using speed Fusion which is a whole different topic and I'll link more videos to that I have the ability to go and actually check the health and check the status and check the speed speed of each individual connection pretty easily now I'm doing a lot of different testing here on all of these but this is the active tunnel I'm using again a different video if we want to dive into that but I can see with this channel actively what is being used and right now it's just me recording this video so there's nothing really being done but if I wanted to do a download test I can hit download and start and now I can look at each of these connections up here and see what speed I'm getting through that particular Network and which one's the healthiest for me so remember T-Mobile is getting us three bars we had really good at T on Cell 2 and Verizon was on this one and even though we only had two or three bars in Verizon we're still getting 10 megabytes down so that's a pretty good connection on all of them we can also look at latency over here it does look like T-Mobile might be struggling the most in this particular location right it's going to change we had over 800 megabytes a second on latency so that could be saturation could be a slow Tower we don't really know but overall my speeds were really strong pretty healthy I was getting kind of mid 40s there at the end and really these this this column here is going to tell you how much dropouts you had in packets um you can see that's even pretty strong overall with the speed Fusion that's what speed Fusion reduces so not diving into this too much but this is kind of My overall connection and how I was able to be connected was doing zoom and be able to have a full work week while not necessarily having phone service and not being able to use that as my Hotspot to stay connected the other real benefit of something like this is this feels like home Wi-Fi when I pull into a campground I'm not figuring out which one I have to switch to every device I have is connecting to the Wi-Fi that comes off the pep wave and then the pep wave is telling is figuring out the best way to get connected if I didn't want to be using starlink let's say I was under a tree I can just go and I can turn off starlink for that particular location and everything will stay online if I get to a location then now all of a sudden starlink is working really well for I can come back and I can turn starlink on and it will turn it on and get connected now for the USB modem I have I have that currently disabled I only have a hundred gigs on the particular data plan I have in that one and it's on T-Mobile I didn't need that here so I've left that disabled but if I wanted to enable that one it's all about dragging and dropping and configuring how my home is connected and everything all of my devices my computers my tablets my phones will connect to one Wi-Fi source all the time I never have to change that so that's kind of how that works here on this side all right guys thank you so much for joining me just kind of seeing how we travel how the internet works as we travel through this was I think a really good place to show just how different types of connections can really make a difference in being connected where you go or not having service at all and potentially having to move if I didn't have this setup I would have be driving into town for meetings and doing video uploads in town and I would have been basically removing me from home so it's been really nice to just kind of stay here chill out do what we need to do work as much as we need to but then also have time for fun which is what this lifestyle is all about alright guys hope to see you all on the road see you in the next video

Road Warrior Insider Edition [Music] now let's talk about a couple things first off is what is an ultimate Road Warrior bundle and why do we like that naming convention and what is The Insider bundle but I first want to start with this is going to be a no drill no hole installation required it's all done inside and can be a great option so if you want to learn more kind of stick to the end first we're going to talk about the ultimate Road Warrior series that series is all about redundancy and stability in your connection it always involves some sort of dual modem device you can have two active kind of cell connections happening at the same time plus others which we'll talk about and so that's what the ultimate Road Warrior series is always going to be focused on is is multiple ways to get connected at the same time The Insider bundle kind of function to all of this is going to be based on an antenna that can be mounted inside no holes needed Up on the Roof no cables dropping um through the ceiling or anything like that can be a very very simple and very quick installation now let's kind of go through each of these elements and what's in the bundle and how that all works again I will put chapter markers throughout the video here so if you want to skip ahead or you know something and you want to skip to the next part feel free to do so we're first going to talk about the main kind of command Hub to this entire thing which is the peplink transit Pro Duo this is a super solid device and our absolute favorite one kind of on our store right now it is a dual modem device you have a cat 7 and a cat 12 modem in it if you don't know what that means don't worry about it but they are super solid modems they give you the best kind of cross comparison with all the carriers certified on all the carriers you can do everything you need to from a hotspot on this device it also has multiple different ways to get connected see on top of those two different cell connections you have Wi-Fi as well I can connect to the campground Wi-Fi here and use that as a connection Source I also have a Wan Port here on the bottom that allows me to connect to starlink or T-Mobile home or other any other kind of ethernet um kind of Internet coming through you can use that as a source you have up to or you probably even at least five different ways you can have this online all at the same time so if one of those connections ever drops out it will just bring up the next one or it'll load balance across all of them depending on your use case this is our favorite device if you were to ask Eric and I what we're traveling with and what we started with it was all this device's Transit Pro Series is a super solid device the last point I'd like to say on this is this has the upgraded processor so out of the entire fleet currently on peplink this is the one that has that fastest processor on it and is a really really great option if you're pairing it with something like starlink so you get the full throughput coming through there's tons of advanced features we're not going to go through on this video about Advanced routing and guest networks and Wi-Fi six all types of really cool stuff so if you want to learn more about this I'll link a couple resources and videos around this video description or above where you can learn more but this is a really really great device and we're really excited that this is the center of all our ultimate Road Warrior bundles currently now the next one is going to be the parsec Akita light that is this antenna here there are two different versions there's the parsec Akita and then there's the Akita light the main difference is not the shell the shell is exactly the same the white the metal kind of antennas are the same but it's the cables coming off the bottom the light is going to have a little slightly thinner cables but are very very flexible to use um and it comes in a six foot or 15 foot option so it is really easy to work with especially since you're masking it close nearby inside this antenna is relatively thin it's a little bit big from a box standpoint but the idea is you're going to put this high up on a wall and you can screw it in with the included screws it's two screws and then just kind of drops in or my favorite installation type is just using velcro just kind of sticking it up so it's easy to come down if I need to and then there's no holes in the wall the six foot cords that come off of it we've custom ordered from parsec itself so you can only get that here and mold must have and that makes it really really easy to install we're really excited about this antenna we've tested it pretty extensively inside and have seen just about as good as performance of a roof antenna using this inside your RV now one quick disclaimer is if your RV is something like an Airstream or you have metal inside your insulation foam walls this might not be the best bundle for you as you really need to get your antenna outside the metal box and then bringing in bringing in the signal for then producing Wi-Fi or something now finally let's talk quickly about power this has two different power options it comes with both included you're going to have an AC and a DC power option so either a wall plug or a plug that goes off of a 12 volt power source we always will prefer the 12 volt power source because mainly it stays on while you're moving and while you're boondocking it's just easier to use you never think about it sometimes if you don't have an inverter your AC power outlets can come on and off based on if you're plugged in so 12 volt is always easy to go with and the draw is very very animal on these overall now this has been a quick overview kind of of The Insider bundle and the features and functions of the hardware but there might be more questions or more you want to learn about each of these and we have a great resource for that available to members I will list quickly kind of some of the member kind of perks we offer which could be like discounts on Hardware discounts on data plans improved shipping Advanced replacement there's a ton of them but one that's really important important to note is going to be the membership to the RV mobile internet resource center that is Merck as we call it is a great resource to learn more or a place you can even ask questions on forms and groups if if you wanted to kind of dive in and get really deep with that that is included in our membership with as well as all these other perks so definitely something worth looking into if you're in the beginning of researching kind of mobile internet and you want to learn more all right guys it has been so great hanging out with you at camp today thank you so much for joining us and I hope to see you soon bye [Music]", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2023-08-19T13:00:23Z", "channelId": "UCE9KnGK2TcpXLlIi5cQfGvg", "title": "No-Drill, All Thrill: Insider

{"id": "1F9Q4VJN3I8", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "5clAz3Hqf26EUYxxbLHp0X3hUYU", "transcript": "hey guys Eric from mobilemustave.com and today we're going to go over some of the surge protection Solutions available at mobilemusthalp.com through our partnership with Hughes Auto formers and power watchdog [Music] before I get started I do want to tell you kind of the history of my traveling with surge protectors or the lack thereof and why it kind of spurred off my interest in starting to offer Power Protection Services to our customers back in 2022 so last year we were hosting a product for the escapees group Escapade and we were in we had a vendor Booth peplink had come out they had a professional photographer that came out and they were interviewing me inside of my RV and while they were interviewing me we heard this large Bang and we looked out the front window my power pedestal because of the way we were oriented was actually kind of further forward so we could see it and it was on fire not good I have a very Advanced power solution inside of my RV I've ripped out everything that came with it and replaced it all with victron products and I immediately started getting alerts on my phone saying uh you no longer have a neutral and there's a lot of problems with that power pedestal and figure it out basically so in that situation I was able to go out and carefully with a pair of gloves disconnect my RV and there was no damage to the plug but it did create some you know awareness to me that the distance from the power pedestal to the inside of my coach where I have my switch and surge protection solution is a potential area of risk for me so that's when I started digging into these and candidly power Watchdog was my second product or second choice that I looked at we looked at another product that was being used at Integra where my motorhome is sold and we started out with that product one of the biggest reasons why we ended up not going with that product is they didn't have a tremendous amount of accessibility for us when we had additional questions and the app that they used to monitor the solution kept crashing on my phone and no one could seem to get it to work so we started kind of continually invest and one of our customers at Escapade said you gotta check out the power Watchdog products this right here is the product that I use in my RV and it is a pedestal mounted 50 amp power protection product and this also includes a emergency power off solution or an EPO so it will emergency disconnect the product from Power if it senses a potentially dangerous situation now we'll list the full details and specifications of the surge protection module as well but keeping it at a high level what we love about this product is it's so easy to use in addition to being so well built this dog here lights up white when all is good it turns red when you got yourself a problem it's pretty much that simple now if you're in the gray a little bit and maybe you're using a dog bone and you have only one leg of AC power coming in because you're using 30 amp power you may see an error code here and that's okay and all of those error codes are listed here so you can quickly diagnose what's going on it may not be a problem it may just be notifying you of something you already know but I have to be honest I don't really use any of this because check this out that's my app that's the app that I'm running and that's giving me real-time statistics about everything going on with the power coming into my coach I get all the information I need to know about what's going on with the power coming in off the pedestal on both leg one and leg two and it will supply alerts and information about everything that might be going on with the surge protection system not only will it provide me with that information but it does support push alerts so it will provide alerts on your phone if you have a power event and the app supports with some optional accessories the ability to plug into our peplink mobile internet Solutions so that you can monitor all of this information when you're away from the coach this product also includes a removable and replaceable surge protection module and we love that if you're in a situation with a competing product and you have a large surge event you're basically taking the product and tossing it the watt power Watchdog products have a removable and replaceable module and that module is free of charge for you for two up to two years after your purchase they will provide you with an additional module we do recommend that you pick up an extra module at checkout so you can just travel with one and but you always know that if you do use up that module you can put in your spare and they're going to send you another one for free so that you've got an additional spare they're pretty inexpensive now if you do use up your module just one note it will continue to function the electronic power off will continue to function you're just not going to have that that surge protection in the event that you have a surge in energy until you replace that module moving on this little guy right here allows you to lock the unit up to the pedestal or it's in pretty much anywhere if you're interested in locking up the solution that's what that does and something I wouldn't have even really thought about until I purchased the competitive solution and then realized that I had a problem is that there are handles on both sides of these plugs so that you can remove them competitive product does have a handle on the pedestal side but no handle on this side that's going into your coach why does that matter well when you go to break camp and you go to disconnect this so you can put it in your storage Bay you'll find that without a handle you're basically holding this and then the handle from your coach and you're trying to basically squeeze this while disconnecting a very large power connection plug that's designed to carry 12 000 watts of power so it's not easy to pull apart with this added handle down here you can just pull them apart nice quick and easy talking form factors for a second you've got your pedestal Mount like we discussed your 30 or 50 amp option and then you've got your hardwire option as well the hardware option is going to be mounted inside of the RV basically after the power plug comes into to the coach typically before your transfer switch so from the power pedestal to this unit on the inside then to the transfer switch assuming you have a generator and a transfer switch which most folks do but if you don't then it would just be in between your circuit breaker panel and the power coming in you would apply this basically try to get it as early on from the pedestal as you can but still within the coach which one would I go with that's a toss-up right so pedestal Mount means you're getting your protection right from the pedestal you're protecting that very expensive wire I've got one of those Power Wheels in my coach they run about 400 so if I blew up the power reel that could be expensive uh but at the same point this is going to be more cumbersome for your pack up and your pack Downs this being installed permanently uh is has a lot of benefits too so I think it's really just a form factor Choice based on each individual customer's needs now as I mentioned there is there are options that have fewer features if you're looking to save a few bucks maybe you're not full-time or maybe it's just you know the the benefits uh are not you know worth the cost so you can step into some of the entry level products we are carrying the entire line so we could do just about all of those Solutions you can check out the pages but

{"id": "cNrmITdZMd0", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "OTTTRRbjxK3xNlXqPQ2nHCed8uY", "transcript": "hey guys Eric with mobile must have.com and today I've got a new product from Hughes Auto former the makers of power Watchdog products it's their new digital multimeter if you have a multimeter already you may still want to watch this video because this little guy's got some tricks up its sleeve come along with us and I'll tell you all about it [Music] this is the one that I was carrying in my RV as my backup and then I've got a kind of higher on one as well I've got a ton of them because I'm always doing power stuff but you know there's a lot of like modes what are all these doing and what is AC and DC power and wheat did he say the AC power is the one on the pedestal or is it the D there's a lot going on and the average person who's just trying to figure out what's going on with a fuse or a circuit or checking to see if the pedestal power is experiencing an issue doesn't want or need a you know degree in electrical engineering so Hughes knows that the folks at uh at autoformers spent a lot of time developing a multimeter that can really kind of take a lot of the guesswork out of what you need to quickly diagnose power problems on the road first if you notice on that screen what does it say it says Auto the device has the ability to Auto detect um you know pretty much whatever you've got going on when you go into diagnose a power solution so if you hop over to the pedestal you want to diagnose what's going on with AC power it's going to know its AC it's going to automatically switch over to AC there's no switching or anything you need to deal with if you're diagnosing something on a circuit a little tiny fuse something with your DC side systems or you're checking you know 12 volt positive or negative connectivity to wire something in it's going to automatically know you're on the DC side and it's going to give you the correct voltage and readouts it comes with your standard multimeter power leads here and what I like I've seen these in some of the newer units super cool is that it cover it has these insulating covers here so if you're trying to get into the back of something and you don't want to touch any wires that you're not supposed to touch it has these insulating connectors but you can pull them off to give yourself access to prongs that may be inside of like a power plug or something like that where you need a little bit more depth so that's a nice touch they've also really kind of sharpened up the tips here so they're very sharp so if you did want to go through some insulation to get to the wire without stripping the wire back you could do so so nice good high quality leads there in addition to auto mode this also has the ability to no contact sense ac voltage kind of like those wands that you can just get close to a power panel and see if there's power before you go messing with it to avoid getting yourself a shock and that's a super cool feature you normally need a totally separate tool for that so if you just hold down this function key and go over on the menu to ncv which is second to last on the screen you don't even need these power leads anymore if you're looking to check a standard plug to see if it's hot or not you can just go right over to a plug and boom Oh there's power there something's going on so this now has the ability to quickly tell I'm pretty far away from the power source if I go over here right to the hot is always the smaller hole in the United States boom it's going in the there's a light on the front there saying red don't touch that it's still hot so it gives you the ability to quickly check this will also work on the power pedestal before you go doing any electrical repairs another feature I really like on this little thing is the light not only can you press that second button right there once and get the display to backlight which is so helpful but if you hold that button down it's got a flashlight on the back of it you might think that's kind of gimmicky but when you're out there you're in the rain you're in the cold you're just trying to figure out what fuse is bad having a light on your multimeter is it's just a really nice option especially considering how low the price point is on this little device so you've got that no contact voltage sensor you've got all of the features of a traditional multimeter you got a super compact case you've got the backlight you've got the flashlight there's a lot going on in this little guy for a very very low and attractive price point for a complete list of specifications hop over to mobilemusthal.com and check out the listing page we'll also put that in the description of the video yes it's got you know the ability to look at your frequencies you know resistance it can check for open circuits it's a standard test light it does everything that a standard multimeter would do plus it gives you the

not only these products but of competitive products we are happy to announce a partnership with Hughes Auto formers makers of the power Watchdog line of power accessories and Power Protection products for the mobile Enthusiast as you know mobile must-have doesn't necessarily sell every product out there we only sell products that we extensively test and we only sell products that we use on the road if you see one of us out in the wild we will be using these products and we also only sell products where we have access to the manufacturer should there be an issue that helps us understand the product it helps us improve the product over time and it helps us protect our customers if there's ever an issue now Brett over at Hughes Auto formers has stepped up and really provided us with quite a bit of information and access to Hughes Auto formers and he's also making a pretty darn good product so that's why we selected to use autoformers as our power partner moving on to some products and just a high level overview we'll do individual videos on each of these shortly on the product pages but this is my power solution my Power Protection solution that I use in my RV and I love this thing not only because it's well built and it does a good job protecting my RV but also because it's so simple to use this little doggie turns white when all is good turns red when you've got a problem and if there's something minor going on there is also an error screen here if it just wants to tell you about something that could potentially be a problem over here all of your error codes are listed so you can quickly identify what's going on with that code but I got to be honest I never even used that screen because check this out look at the app that's all the information that I get on my phone real time to tell me exactly what's going on with the power in my RV when I'm around my coach with some accessories you can also plug that into your peplink internet solution and you can get all that information when you're away from your coach which is even cooler how about that this product is available in a 50 amp and a 30 amp version and it's available hardwired or pedestal Mount depending on your preference these do also support dog bone adapters so if you are find yourself in a situation where you have to adapt your 50 amp coach to a 30 amp using an adapter you are covered as well next I want to talk to you about their voltage booster products if you've ever been in an RV park where your air conditioners won't turn on and you know you're just like what is going on why won't my compressors kick on that's almost always likely because you have a low voltage situation where your voltage is below the minimum for the air conditioning compressor to kick on we can get into the science here but I can tell you it's a safe product we'll do a formal product video on it essentially it's just stepping up the voltage just like a standard Step Up voltage converter would do so as I said we'll be doing detailed videos on all of these products but I do want to talk a little bit about some of the accessories as well some really cool stuff one of my favorites is this multimeter here what a cool product this product one of the best things about it is it has auto mode that means that you don't have to be someone who understands that big long tourney dial and what all those things do but it has all the features as you start to learn more about power so that you can diagnose different Power Solutions but that auto mode just connect these terminals to the power solution it'll automatically figure out AC power DC power and all those things to get you connected and figuring out exactly what's going on additionally what a cool feature when you're outside and you're like ah Where's My Flashlight I don't know where to plug everything in you just hold down one of these buttons and boom there's a light on the back it's just so smart and the price point on This is highly affordable this is definitely something I would recommend you have in your tool kit if you've saved up any of those mobile must-have bucks and you've got some of that from your membership in your account you can use stuff like that to pick up some of these lower cost accessories here's another one I love how cool is that you just plug it into an outlet and boom it tells you the voltage that's coming in and if that voltage starts to get low or high it's going to change the screen from its standard color to Red hey wow that's red we have a problem let's diagnose further that could be a low-cost way for you to get a dashboard dial on what's going on with the power to make sure you understand how to keep your stuff protected there's a whole host of other accessories this is for portable generators in case you have a portable generator and your coach won't fire up because it doesn't have a bonded neutral that's a whole different thing but there's a lot of accessories and we carry them all so we just wanted to let you know that this is now on our store and membership discounts as always apply to the complete line of products so thank you guys so much for watching and we'll see you on the road", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2023-08-10T14:27:32Z", "channelId": "UCE9KnGK2TcpXLlIi5cQfGvg", "title": "Power Watchdog Product Launch Announcement (5min)", "description":

{"id": "PXKj0DCQbBs", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "ntyJzJhX7tkbdPQTPZ2XzM92cns", "transcript": "all right it is here this is the starlink in motion antenna I have it it has arrived this is the Mount this is the antenna itself and it is time to get it installed [Music] hi guys this is Andy from mobile must have and in this video we are going to continue my upgrade process of the inner internet in my fifth wheel um and today we are installing the flat high performance starlink antenna that is designed for in-motion use with RVs insulation process seems pretty straightforward it's basically going to be mounting the mount itself four screws go in attaching the starlink antenna and then routing a cable uh so let's get up on the roof kind of give you a quick overview of the plan there let's get to it so let's just do a quick unboxing um I've already gone through it so I've already it's kind of already opened but the first in the small box here you're going to get the mount mountain ship separately just a straight little piece of metal with some foam pretty straightforward there you're going to get a template that's going to be if you need to use a template for anything and line up front big flat high performance antenna set that up there now the rest of the box I don't know you can see it there uh we got a couple of things so you're gonna have this is the cable that goes on the antenna down into your power supply and then the power supply goes right into power that I am not going to use the router that goes directly into the peplink um so we don't even need all the extra stuff and then it comes with cables or a silicone and we're going to use some of these parts and some of them not mainly we're just going to use the lag bolts and then the starlink specific like machine screws that will connect the mount to the starlink so probably just the lag bolts that and then of course dicor [Music] a couple other tools we're going to have on us is I do need to drill a new hole so we're going to bring this set up with us okay that's it we have our dicor Park on we've got all our screws okay so before I head up on the roof I mentioned I'm not going to use the starlink router and I'm actually going to be plugging starlink directly into my peplink router now I'm doing that for a couple reasons the main is for easability and use we use the peplink as kind of the main command center the main primary source that gives me Wi-Fi but then that I can with that one Center I can tell the Wi-Fi or how my device is connected to the internet where is my internet coming from is it coming from an LTE connection a 5G connection starlink a Wi-Fi is when it is my main command center so I tell the peplink how we're going to connect to the internet and then my devices get internet that way and now starlink is going to be just kind of one more tool in this toolkit per se of how we're going to stay connected to the internet so that's what's going to make this really great and that's why we don't need the starlink router because I already have that I get a way better router overall with the peplink and so we're just going to kind of bypass that but starlink now will be great and directly related directly linked into my peplink unit first thing we're going to do is make sure we pick a location I could have gone back here I actually ended up going right behind the front AC which is what the camera is sitting on here um and that seemed to be the best location I also know parking under trees up front seems to be the less obstructed I'm cleaning it off here to make sure my Surface is going to adhere the dicor really well and knock it in the way with any dirt make sure you use the Right cleaning material though for your particular roof type then it's all about lining up your Mount trying to center it make sure it's aligned and then marking it now there's four screws I'm using here it's going to come with the kit the four lag screws are what I'm basically the only thing I'm using is really adhere it to the roof itself and then you also need to pull out the four machine screws there's two individual ones for the bottom and two for the top of the antenna which Mount the antenna to the Mount you'll see more of those in a second once it's lined up I basically put marks on the roof itself then I did a pre-dab of dye core on each of those particular locations and then I'm going to screw in through the die core I've done this with solar panels and things before and this keeps basically water out all the way through the screw channel so I don't have any issues of water going through even if it gets under the dicor from another location foreign [Music] key thing is not to over tighten these lag screws as that can cause stripping and more issues within your your surface so tighten them but not over tighten them and then once those are in place I go back over with more dicor so that there's no water coming in from the top and the bottom where the actual Mount is now sitting on top of uh a dicor too so everywhere the surface is watertight then we're going to be running the cable so I'm actually running the cable through an existing solar box or kind of cable drop I've got it's a junction box from Home Depot I don't think it's that expensive overall and then I ran a two inch PVC pipe through that hole there's a video on this entire install from Eric which I'll link above but basically I'm just running this cable through now I'm not using a cable Grom in here because I didn't have one big enough at the time for this um so I'll show you at the end when I did there and then just run that cable through um yeah through the existing opening I've got it's been a really nice system to have this kind of cable system so if I'm running new antennas or anything for me testing all this stuff it's been really nice but definitely something I'd recommend too uh yeah so pulling all the cable through the entire box and kind of getting all the slack out and then kind of stuffing it down into the kitchen cabinet which is directly below once the cabling is more or less done I didn't make it perfect just yet it's about attaching kind of those machine screws to the starlink antenna I've done the front two or the bottom two and those are a little different because they're gonna actually like fall into place and kind of lock in which you see there and then the top two are going to be perfectly aligned with the mount and the antenna to to screw in they were pretty challenging to do not challenging from a technique standpoint but I just have to be patient and make sure the threading got right it was a hard angle to get to but once you get the thread right and everything aligned they they uh they screwed in pretty easily and then they tighten with an allen wrench so make sure you bring that up on the roof with you and that tool uh then at the very end I attach the cable and pulled the rest of the slack out the challenging part here for me was just making sure not to get additional dicor on anything as I did this kind of all within an hour um so just gonna keep that in mind that dicor is going to be sticky for the first 24 hours or so so don't don't accidentally run into it and then for me I I heard that if you get material on the top of this antenna it can affect its performance so I just used a multi-purpose cleaner just to kind of wipe off the top make sure I didn't have any oils or grease or anything that I had on me as I was moving this um around um it should I'll probably clean this as often as I clean my solar panels which you can see it's not as often as I should in the middle of the desert um but yeah so I'm keeping this kind of clean and making it start with a nice clean surface uh final step for me up on the roof was really just to make sure the cable any excess cable I took off the roof I didn't want that flapping around pulled that through the rest of the box and and just kind of cleaned up that entire project and there's kind of the final results so uh you've got a nice brand new white antenna on my four-year-old yellowing roof um which looks really nice I feel really good about the install the placements good it's right in front of my bathroom fan behind my front AC um and yeah so it's looking really good the cables run is actually for me it's probably only four or five feet between where the antenna is in that cable box you can see the two other seven in one antennas I have on there from bundles and then other testing ones and then my solar cable is kind of all going into that one location so probably need some zip ties but overall it's looking really good uh for this particular part of our install and then final kind of close-up look of the mount with the die core coming out underneath the bottom that to me is exactly what I wanted to see it shows me that the bottom is sealed dicor is also really sticky so if any of those lag screws have an issue dicor alone will probably hold this down with no issue so really excited about how that's looking overall I think this is this is again exactly what I was hoping to get out of this install okay at this point I've basically dropped my cable through the roof from the gray box outside I've pushed it from the actual cabinet that's connected to the ceiling and then I'm now underneath that cabinet behind like what we call it a pantry attainment from this cool Keystone unit so now I'm going to feed basically what comes into the power supply oh so I'm gonna have to find a place to mount the power supply and then out of the power supply will basically come an ethernet cable and that's what goes directly into the pep wave so let me find some room in all of this to mount this and get cables working and then basically we're ready to power up I would say I'm lucky in this sense that I need like six inches of cable they do send you about I'm not sure it's probably 20 feet um so I'm just going to zip tie this all together try and keep it out of the way as much as possible but basically this is all I need just one to that one now the power supply is pretty nifty it's gonna have these little logos on it so you know exactly which one you're plugging into so you've got the little antenna I guess it's upside down so you're gonna have like a little space antenna on this one and then you've got that's a that's a network icon so it's going to be for your your Lan one which is gonna be what I've got here and then the cables themselves are like angled and then there's even a little groove on one side so you can only plug it in one way it's definitely not a micro USB it's got a similar but much larger shape to it so it's definitely a One Direction cable okay now from here I have this cable that has dropped down from the upper cabinet which we will also use to plug in also is a one-way cable sure it is now at this point I have two plugs left one is I now have to actually plug the power adapter into the ethernet that goes into the peplink solution uh so that's going to go right into the WAN Port of whichever pep wave you have I have a br2 in this particular um setup here so I'm going to go into the second Lan port and then we're going to apply everything for power and link up to the actual satellite all right and just to see if you can see it so the sign of success is going to be that light and we'll get to activation so now let's dive into quickly how to activate that and then you're all good to go now that we have everything installed really all we need to do is go into the pep wave and make sure we have all of our Wan settings in the right spot what I mean by that is we've plugged in starlink into our Wan Port we need to make sure on the pep wave we have the WAN Port where we want it if you want to be using starlink as an active source of Internet you need to move that when setting to Priority One it will be green once everything has been set up if you want to have it as a backup you can move it to Priority two or priority three based on how you have those settings and it'll be kind of in a standby mode for you so make sure you do that after you get everything plugged in and you have starlink activated now the activation process for starlink is pretty much straightforward too you're going to get a piece of paper in your starlink box it's going to have about six different steps which is pretty straightforward let's go to starlink go to this buy page check out put in this code and that will basically give you your starting your activation and that will basically set you up for their monthly plan with starlink using your existing Hardware so that's how they kind of set up that monthly plan very straightforward now it will say it takes about an hour to get service and and actually let your satellite connect once you have power we saw Connection in about 15 minutes so just give it a give it a bit of time come back and check on it and you'll see it kind of connect okay can I connect in a few minutes I was able to log in with my mobile app and track the status of my antenna as it was coming online now I don't have the router so I wasn't seeing a direct connection I was able to see it through basically a cloud connection that the internet was using so as soon as that antenna came online um or even if when I was searching I was able to see that that was the status and then it connected for me on the mobile app so that was one way I was able to track it now it's actually been a few days since I've done the installation itself we've moved to about four different cities we've gone from Tucson Arizona to Phoenix certified forest and now we're in Santa Fe and I've been doing pretty consistent testing as we've moved along I have seen really great performance from this antenna we are still seeing a couple dropouts every couple minutes you know milliseconds at times but kind of standard to what we used to see with the regular rectangular dish the speeds I'm getting I seem a little bit better but I am not testing in the same Zone I was before I will be doing that soon but I am getting up to 200 megabytes when I'm doing some speed tests in reality I'm still seeing great speeds of around 100 in usability but I'm also bonding that with speed fusion and a couple other really cool things which we have more information on coming soon so um overall I'm seeing good performance I have been doing some testing while in motion and it does work you can be driving and get connectivity however just like cellular can be I have it was dropping out on us probably more frequently than I was seeing like Verizon drop out as it was jumping towers driving through the mountains of like Flagstaff and and Eastward um so it's not super consistent or any more consistent I would say than cellular but it was connecting I was getting 60 mags on the top of a mountain which was cool when I had nothing else no Verizon no T-Mobile ATT so it is proving that it can be really beneficial in those places the last thing I haven't tested just yet is parking under trees I've been in the desert I am going Eastward so that will be a follow-up video we can do where we can show kind of what we're going to get under trees as I go further kind of into Tennessee and then Northbound we'll do more videos on that there now last thing is I did do a couple more tests of climbing up on my roof and verifying those bolts underneath were tight I did find one I had to tighten and I would do that especially after your first or second drive as things kind of wiggle and jiggle into place and settle you might find you have a loose screw so something I'm going to keep keep attention of and I might look at adding a lock wash pressure there to constantly give it some tension um it's normally what I'd expect to find on a system like that but we'll see that'll be something we update you guys on if that changes I also was able to kind of finish out where I had that cable going in I put in a temporary kind of uh plug here to keep water out I've got some really cool products pending so new videos on those soon with icotec technology coming out and that's what I'll be moving to so short-term solution here for a much cooler kind of solution coming soon all right guys that is the main part of this video if you have any questions you can leave comments down below but it is best if you email us info mobile must-have.com or you can chat with a live agent um with our chat feature that's at the bottom right hand side

{"id": "ce3MJmtJGR0", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "lIB8LeZhJ_Xpx_zCY9acCxSlbAY", "transcript": "hi guys this is Andy from mobile must have and in this video a slightly different location as we're here to talk about the peplink relay [Music] now this is a really interesting device that we're going to do a quick video on today um and it's talking about how a routing internet traffic if you have home base or someone that can act as a home base for you basically this device is going to allow you to connect your mobile Hep link unit so the one you're traveling with and it's going to make it look like the internet is coming from this device when you're streaming when you're on Google when you're doing anything online so if you're looking for a way to make your internet traffic always look like it's coming from a single place this device is doing a good job of kind of solving that problem there's really two main well there's probably more but two really good examples of this uh one is if you would like to stream channels from back home wherever that may be this you can leave um back at your home base or like I'm going to be leaving this at my parents house and you can then every time you log into the internet on your RV regardless of where your RV is it's going to make it look like your traffic is coming from here assuming you have it connected that way and that can be great for streaming so if you wanted to get your morning news channels your evening news channels or any local channels you can do that now with streaming services if this device is connected so that can be really handy if local channels and like sports channels and all that stuff is very important to you another use case is going to be for anybody that works remotely and doesn't want to have their IP address and their locations kind of move around um depending on what you do some people it's important they have a more kind of stable looking IP for security reasons this can be another good way of doing that so if you they let you put this into the office you could always kind of be coming now in from an office standpoint from your pebbling device if you have this at a home base and you have your pep wave connected to it it'll always look like your traffic is coming from that particular modem that you have back at the house so that can be a really good use case too another thing to keep in mind is on your device in your RV that you're traveling with that will use speed Fusion to connect to the relay that gives you a huge Advantage if you have multiple connections whether that's starlink and a 5G connection like on the br1 pro or you have a Duo that's the cat 7 or cat 12 or dual CAD 12 and you've got two active data plans in there you can have both of those or any of those combinations active going up through speed Fusion connecting to this wherever you've had it and now be streaming with that one of the big disadvantages to speed fusion um especially if you're going through the speed Fusion Cloud there's a lot of streaming services we'll see that as a VPN and block any access if you use this and have this as a home base Hulu Netflix Disney plus whatever they'll see it as a regular house or a regular connection and they're not going to block it they don't see this as a VPN so when now we've been in our RV I've been traveling around my location always looks like it's Dallas because that's where this is and streaming and everything works perfectly and it just always assumes we're coming from this Dallas house uh so that has been really really nice so I'm still able to use speedfusion to get better buffering and better speeds um but I'm able to actually stream now because it's not going through a VPN now it can be a negative if you don't want all your streaming uh to take up um your speed fusion and you can still do that this is just another option now that works really really well now I wanted to quickly go over the setup of this particular device as it doesn't take too long but there are a couple different steps and a couple different ways to do that so I want to make sure we're just going to quickly go over that if you've got any high level questions uh the beginning is all you have to do is plug this into your house into your network so you're gonna give it power and then on the ethernet side you're going to plug that directly into a lan port on your modem as it's taking internet from your from your house um and that's all you have to do you've got to wait for the status light to turn green you know it's going to be online then we're going to move to the next step now the next step there's basically two different ways to do it I'm going to do it through in control that is the cloud-based platform that kind of manages all the devices if they're online you can though do this with a direct connection ethernet to your computer the steps are going to be fairly similar afterwards but for me I already have the control setup everything's in control it's going to be easier now if you've done setup and device configuration with mobile must have your devices are already in control and we can give you access to your group so if you're interested in that let us know if you've already set up your own in control it'll work just the same as what I'm showing but uh if you don't you can still set up without any control you just have to hardwire this with an ethernet cord to your laptop or some device and then you can uh remote in that way the IP address to access this is on the back one note though it does say the password is public it's actually admin so it's going to be admin admin if you need that there's also going to be a full written guide to support this kind of section of this video so if you've got any questions reference to guide I'll put the link in the description below if you've got any questions about that so I'm using an iPad you can use a computer I suggest not a phone but it does work if if that's all you've got from in control uh we're going to log into in control and we're going to add the relay to our in-control devices that just takes the serial number so we're going to punch that in here and you'll see it get added to the list now I panicked a little bit at this step as it took a little bit longer than I expected to show up in a online status I thought I'd missed a step somewhere but just be patient for me it took about five minutes for the device to connect to in control once it's there we now have to link the relay to our mobile peplink device that we use one as a transitive br1 Pro something like that first we need to get the sharing code out of the relay itself so we're going to remote Act since in from in control to get that here you just go to settings and then your web access here once that loads you're going to go to the second tab which is the speed Fusion connect tab speed Fusion connect protect tab then you're going to see your sharing code there we need to copy that we're going to paste it in somewhere later so copy that or paste it somewhere else on your screen we're going to need that in a second um once we have that particular link we're done with this page we can close this particular Tab and now we're going to go back to in control and remote into our primary device it's for me this is our br2 but again configure Transit your br1 pro whatever you're using um and we're going to kind of do the same steps remote in we're going to go to the speed Fusion connect protect Tab and in a different spot we're actually looking for outbound here the last one was inbound this one's going to be outbound now once you've clicked into outbound we are going to select now I've already set up automatic so we're going to select this one that's existing you might have to create a new one I'm going to select on the name and then we are going to change automatic to sharing relay that's the second option again you might be starting from scratch build it'll be at the top of the list once you select this you'll see an option to drop in the sharing code and then hit save uh if you are looking at what options we suggest on this page again reference the document we have for setting this up and we'll walk through kind of what options we suggest on that particular page at this point once you hit save your devices are linked so everything you need to do is done now the last question is how you want your traffic to be managed do you want it going all traffic over um through the relay you can do that do you want to create a new Wi-Fi network so only devices connected to this new Wi-Fi network are connected and I think that's going to be my top recommendation or third which is another decent option is if you have specific devices you want using like an Apple TV or Roku you can say traffic from this device always goes over some devices I will alert you might change their Mac address iPhones are a good example as they have security built into that but for other devices the MAC address doesn't really typically change so that can be a good option for streaming if that's your main purpose here I like the second option of creating another Wi-Fi that is designated now towards this you can do that directly in the speed Fusion protect tab you can set up basically the new a new Wi-Fi to go to the cloud as it says and follow those steps to that you can create your own Wi-Fi name put your own Wi-Fi password in there this is what we've done too I basically have a regular Network I have a work Network which goes through a different speed Fusion Data Center and then we have a streaming Network which is set up to basically be designed for streaming and devices go through that so that would be our recommendation I will outline those steps in the setup guide as well all of that is linked below but just to give you a few options of kind of what to do now that you have it linked and how you might want to accomplish that now if there's more information you would like to know or you have more advanced level questions yes I have definitely not hint all the details but that is a great thing to be a member for because you can get access to the RV mobile internet forums you get access to the webinars that are posted with Eric our founder Chris and Cherie from RV mobile internet Resource Center where they go deep dive into

home or office this video is for you come along with us and we'll tell you what your options are [Music] hi my name is Eric McCauley with mobilemustave.com and as of today of the filming of this video we've helped over 50 000 rvers get connected with reliable mobile internet at mobilemustave.com the most common thing we hear from customers or potential customers when they come and talk to us is I've done a ton of research and I'm more confused than ever the last video I did on this topic that has I think over a hundred thousand views which is a lot for an e-commerce channel uh I said the exact same thing in the intro which was that's the most common thing people just get overwhelmed with all the choices mobile must have.com has taken a lot of the guesswork out of what to pick by developing what we call mobile internet bundles we bundle together everything our customers need into a comprehensive solution along with the instructions and the support needed to get you online today's video is going to be an overview of those bundle options so that you can kind of get a clear understanding of which option is best for you before we get started on what the options are I want to give you a little bit of my background as the founder of mobilemustave.com so I started my first tech company back in 2000 about 23 years ago it's kind of crazy to even say that out loud what we did in that first company is we provided I i t support and infrastructure services for mostly Banks hedge funds private Equity these were Financial Services institutions that needed reliable connectivity and access to the internet which then connected them to the stock market that company was then sold I started another company in 2009 we grew that company up and it was eventually sold and acquired by the fifth largest I.T support company in the country now when I hit the road back in 2015 my business partners and folks thought I was crazy they did not think I was going to be able to work from the road reliably so it was super important that I had technology with me that was going to make sure that I could get my job done what we found when we did research on everything that was kind of marketed towards the RV community and RV spaces most of that stuff was very consumer grade low end componentry stuff that was designed to kind of keep the price down but sadly that also meant keeping the quality down and none of it was up to Snuff in terms of what I needed in terms of Rock Solid reliable internet mobile must-have was born that is really where the concept of this company came from I said you know what I have a feeling people are going to hit the road and they're going to want to be able to work and play from the road like they're at home you'll always and often find that commercial devices like the peplink routers we have here are always a step or two behind the latest and greatest thing you're hearing about from you know wired or PC mag or whatever and the reason for that is because when those things come out the standards just like cellular 5G they haven't really been adopted yet this stuff's kind of still being invented and the testing really hasn't occurred yet so they tend to guinea pig those Technologies in the consumer market and they're selling it to the consumers and they're kind of figuring out what works and doesn't work with the consumer at that time commercial companies that are working with police ambulance fire military they're not going to mess around with stuff that's bleeding edge like that because they're going to have problems for their customers so that's why you'll typically see these guys hold back a generation on the technology for certain things because they want to make sure that what they're selling you is really really gonna work one last note before we get started on the bundles just be careful where you pick this stuff up from if you're looking at products like the peplink products that we sell we have seen quite a few copycat resellers pop up from time to time claiming to do everything that we do claiming to offer unlimited technical support Etc but when you dig into those companies you often find that they don't have the IT background and the bench strength to really offer you guys the support that you need with a product that it is this complex so just be careful there are some good resellers out there we're not the only place to pick this stuff up from just make sure you're getting this from somebody who has the ability to provide you the support not just on the product but who also understands the mobile internet community and what you're facing when you're out there on the road with all those different variables if you're looking at products outside of the peplink ecosystem that is fine but make sure you kind of keep an eye on the brands that you're looking at and try to stick with a company that has a brand name we're seeing a lot of companies come up with these routers that are you know essentially black boxes with no names on them and they typically are also tying high capacity gigabyte data plans into them they oftentimes are referring to them as esim or reseller plans and some of them are okay some of them we've tested we test everything especially because we are in partnership with the mobile internet resource center and our members have access to not only the stuff we sell but information about all mobile internet products through the mobile internet Resource Center so we have to know about it and we want to sell our customers what works best but some of these e-sim products that we're seeing and we're testing some that are great but some of them we're finding are routing customers internet traffic through very suspicious places that are outside of the US what are they doing with that traffic maybe nothing maybe they're looking at that information and then in that data and maybe that's part of how they're providing lower cost internet Solutions because they're potentially making money with that data or that information Maybe not maybe I'm being crazy but just be careful out there if you work with a reputable company a company that you know that you trust if you're working with a reputable name brand that has to worry about security you're going to be in a safer spot now again that's not to say those you know low-cost kind of black boxes that don't have names on them are terribly bad but just know that your internet traffic might be going somewhere and being shared with somebody that you may not want that to be shared with here at mobilemusthal.com to make things easier for customers we've created uh Lanes inside of our our bundles or we call we're kind of like they're model designations just like when you look at a car maybe you like the Toyota Camry or maybe you like the Honda Accord or maybe you like the F-150 pickup truck so our bundles are very similar we have a couple different designations and they each do different things as we start to go into the bundle options I might start referring to some technical terminology if I say a cat 20 modem 5G Wi-Fi six these are all technical terms that you may not know what they mean and that's okay we have a separate educational video that will go through all of the basics of kind of what the terminal analogy is how the technology works and that'll help you really kind of understand which one of these might be best for you so we're going to link that right there that's your educational video you can go ahead and hop through that video we actually recommend you watch first if you're really new to mobile internet but you can also follow along with this video now and write down some questions about stuff that you don't understand what I say and that video is probably going to answer it between the two you're going to have all the information you need to make an informed decision all right so I've rearranged things a little bit to hopefully make things simpler so let's kind of talk about from the entry level bundles all the way through the model lineup it's not necessarily linear but we'll talk about it kind of what the Target customer is in each of these bundle designations starting with the full timer bundle the full timer bundle you don't have to be a full timer but it was designed for folks maybe they're retired maybe they're out just on the weekends maybe they're out a couple months out of the year it doesn't really matter how much they're out but they want reliable internet but they might not necessarily be working from the road or needing like the absolute fastest possible download speeds they just want reliable internet connectivity they don't want to be it people they don't want to constantly be rebooting stuff trying to figure out why it's not working and they just want it to work like you know basically like home internet can I watch Netflix can I browse the web can I do my basic stuff can I do chat can I do Facebook can I do all those things can I make sure all of my devices you know 10 15 20 devices can all connect up to it's technically rated for up to 50 devices that's the full timer the full timer is our entry level bundle that blends value and performance now the full timer is a single cellular modem device which means it has one Cellular Connection all of our bundles have this Wan Port so you can add starlink down the road if you want to add a second second internet source to the device but from a cellular perspective you have two SIM card slots on a minimum of two SIM card slots on every modem full timer included but you're only going to be able to use one of those at a time so you can connect to any carrier you know 18t Verizon T-Mobile Google fi whatever you can connect to but you're going to have you're going to be limited to one connection that can be used at a time you know in addition to that Wan Port if you want to add that for starlink then you would have two connections so full timer is really it's that blend of value with single cellular modem connectivity and good performance great great modem for folks that just want to get connected and don't really want to worry about the technology next we're going to talk about the speed demon bundle and as the name may have told you it's going to be faster so the speed demon is still a single modem device but it's stepping up the performance of that cellular modem that's inside of the device so when you look at the speed demons you may see a speed demon X and look at what that is could be a 5G it could be something else I don't want to get into model designations because this video will likely Outlast the models that are available right now but the point is the speed demon is about a one cellular connected device with the fastest possible cellular module in it available at the time so the speed demon again though still single connected device with those multiple this one having two SIM card slots back here but you're connecting to one Cellular Connection at a time and you're getting the fastest possible connection to that one connection with the speed demon the speed Demon's really popular for vloggers for folks that have uh you know to do a lot of big download and big uploads folks that maybe are streaming a lot of content all at the same time they've got multiple TVs and they want to watch you know three four different Netflix shows all at the same time the speed demon is a really good choice if you're doing voice over IP work or meaning like you're on video conferencing calls and you're doing a lot of mobile work I would probably say you want to kind of keep listening for the next bundles the speed demon is ultra Ultra fast but it's kind of like a sports car we kind of call it it's like two-wheel drive it does that one modem really really fast really really well but your your reliant on that single Cellular Connection for connectivity and if it drops out or has a problem you could lose that Zoom call so we'll talk about the next bundles next but again Speed Demon has that Wan Port you can plug in starlink or an additional external internet source there as well as Wi-Fi as Wan if none of these terms make sense hop over to the educational video and that Wi-Fi as when will let you connect to public Wi-Fi as well so Speed Demon single Ultra fast Cellular Connection with a lot of options and flexibility next we're going to talk about the road warrior or often also known as the ultimate Road Warrior their ultimate really just means it has more bells and whistles maybe it's a little bit faster designation so what's the deal with the road warrior ultimate Road Warrior bundles anything that has the road warrior designation is going to have more than one Cellular Connection available at the time of purchase embedded inside of the device so our ultimate Road Warrior at the time of this filming again this could change models change this has two cellular modems embedded inside of the device and you can connect to two different cell carriers at the same time so you could have Verizon an ATT or T-Mobile all loaded up you know any two that you pick into this device and you can use them simultaneously at the same time and you can then Bond them together into a single unified connection and what that means is is that if any of your connections go down as long as you have some other connection still available that Zoom call that you're on is not going to drop and also if you know for instance a connection gets healthy or something has a problem you're going to stay connected and this is why we call it the ultimate or the road warrior the ultimate Road where Earth because they have more than one connection to the cellular provider now again there's your Wan Port plug-in starlink now you're combining starlink plus cellular modem one plus cellular modem two these also support that Wi-Fi wan to connect out to public Wi-Fi so in a scenario like this with this ultimate Road Warrior you'd have two simultaneous cell connections you could have up to two additional simultaneous connections to external Wi-Fi like Campground Wi-Fi or maybe you just connect to your cell phone hotspot you could do that as well bring in your hotspot for a third Cellular Connection and then you can plug in your starlink up here uh so now you're like one two three four connections uh all with this single device out potentially up to three Cellular Connections plus the starlink four connections all bonded into one unified connection now this is why we call these like the four by four of mobile internet you're starting to really see you know what any single connection that I have can go down I don't care I'm staying on my work call so who are these really really good fits for these are our Road Warriors these are the people that are they're traveling a lot they have to stay connected they're okay with the fact that they may need to purchase more than one cellular data plan in more than one high gigabyte cellular data plan because for them connectivity is key they need to stay connected um ultimate Road Warrior 5G this steps up and basically is two of these so now we're taking two ultra Ultra fast 5G modems and we're bringing it into ultimate Road Warrior 5G there might be a new version at by the time you're watching this video that's okay every single listing page will have a dedicated video for that bundle it'll go into the specific nitty-gritty of that bundle and all of the the technology terminology but the ultimate Road Warrior 5G as the filming of this has two integrated 5G Ultra fast modems two Wan ports up here so you can plug in two star links if you wanted to or T-Mobile home internet or whatever else you want a bunch of other Wan ports this is a monster but price goes up as as features and performance goes up but the key what we're talking about right now is Road Warrior ultimate Road Warrior these are your four-wheel drive vehicles multiple connections multiple traction points to make sure that you can always stay connected so a minimum of two cellular modems on the ultimate Road Warrior and road warrior bundles last let's talk about the Globetrotter the Globetrotter was really built and designed for for marine use but it can be used for just about anything where you have a limitation of kind of how far you need to run your cables so like if you were doing a fixed Mount you know building installation a Globetrotter might potentially be a really good fit for you but specific to why we developed it for mobile internet use it's for it was for the Marine industry so if you have a sailboat or something you know 20 30 40 foot 50 foot Mast and you want to you know get a Cellular Connection up as high as possible you know every 10 feet of vertical gain can improve your signal strength by a hundred percent so let's use that beautiful mask we've got there to get our cellular antenna and our mobile router way up in the air so the Globetrotter bundles are designed typically pretty much all of them have a dome of some sort in the bundles and that Dome will be mounted up high and down from there a single cable single there's a bunch of different mounting options but it's a single ethernet cable will provide Power to this device it has all the cellular and Wi-Fi antennas integrated into this Dome and down you will go down into the cabin area where you can hook this up to your house batteries and power the entire device the Globetrotter many of the globetrottle bundles also have remote Sim injectors so you can actually insert SIM cards from down in the cabin so you never have to go up and service this device up on the map so Globetrotter is it can be multi-modem or single modem depending on the Globetrotter designation but the key kind of use case for Globetrotter is okay I I am in a marine application or somewhere where I have a long distance I have to run cables and I want to make sure I have to run as few cables as possible and I want to go up there as as little as possible because it's really hard to get up there that is what the Globetrotter is best suited for a popular question we get with all these bundles is is it 5G and you know one of the big reasons why we're re-filming this video is two years ago we told folks 5gs you know it's really just not there yet we're seeing some cool stuff millimeter waves out here but it only works in cities and it's been two years since we filmed that last video so 5G is here and it's actually starting to become something that's pretty darn good they find a formally retired the 3G network and that opened up a lot of capacity for certain carriers to sort of move some of the 4G frequencies up into the 5G territories and start rolling out Nationwide 5G so 5G is a super cool thing um you know everyone oh well then I just need 5G well like what we talked about before well dual you know multiple connections might be more important than a single really fast connection so the ultimate Road Warrior for example is very very you know it's priced almost exactly the same as the speed demon 5G so a lot of our customers are like oh so I have to decide between one super fast connection or two 4G connections that are not 5G and the ultimate Road Warrior what's best for me if I had to pick between those two bundles I would go with the 4G technology solution because I'd rather have two good stable 4G connections over one single 5G connection but what if I had what if I had starlink okay now I have starlink so I can balance out my single 5G connection okay maybe this is an option for me but if I have starlink and it's super fast I could get three connections with this even though it's 4G so I lose out on 5G but I get more than one connection so that's a choice um you could go here just get multiple 5G connections but again that's going to jack up your price this is what I run in my RV but I'm in the industry that may not be a fit for you or maybe it is depending on what you're doing with internet I I tell folks all the time times money if you're messing around with your internet connection and you're not just doing what you need to get done it's probably something you want to look at invest in something that's going to give you your time back because your time's more valuable than anything else all right so let's talk about what you get inside of these bundles now that we've talked about all the designations so you obviously get the mobile router we've talked about that you get a roof antenna and there are some choices on the roof antenna side we'll go over some of the kind of high level stuff and then you a DC Direct power wire that is fused and we manufacture these directly so that is specific to mobilemusthalf.com in addition to that you also get sort of the included stuff that you would get with any mobile router and that includes a um standard power cord so an AC power cord this one you can wire directly up to your house batteries typically these will accept anywhere from uh 12 to 30 volts some of them will actually accept up to 56 volt if you have a 48 volt power system so just check that specification sheet inside of each of the you know whatever model you're looking at or whatever bundle you're looking at in addition to the AC power cord you will also get small cellular and Wi-Fi what we call stubby antennas there are small ones here so that you can get this up and running and test it without messing around with installing the roof antenna while you kind of really figure out that this is going to work for you those small antennas also allow the device to be portable and then there's a bunch of optional accessories you can get optional battery packs it'll power these for complete remote access Solutions optional you know DC fused power blocks if you're looking to power multiple devices each bundle will have different different options that kind of are specifically catered to improve that bundle for each of our customers another option you'll see under our mobile internet bundles is access to high gigabyte cellular data plans now we have relationships with either resellers folks that have access to Legacy data plans that are no longer available or direct wholesalers that are authorized to wholesale specific data plans directly through the carriers and there are no contracts with those data plans you pick them up from mobilemusthap.com you prepay for 30 days you keep it for as long as you want it'll auto bill you or you can cancel it at any time we highly recommend for folks that are new to the mobile internet Community to pick up one of the included data plans or the optional data plans in your mobile internet bundle it will dramatically improve the likelihood that you're going to get everything set up and have everything working when you're going through the kind of learning phase and you're learning everything because we're going to be able to support everything from start to finish but the vast majority of what we can do is we can make sure you're on a data plan that is compatible with these devices if you hop into a you know Verizon or T-Mobile or whatever store you're going to be hearing the word unlimited a lot it's unlimited it's unlimited it's Unlimited these are these are folks that are traditionally selling phones and uh if you read into the most of the fine print unlimited it'll get you up to 10 15 maybe 20 30 sometimes even 100 gigabytes of unlimited uh and 100 a decent amount but to give you an idea like someone who's heavily using the internet watching Netflix streaming a lot they're going to use about five to eight gigabytes a day so if it's unlimited but then at 15 gigabytes it throttles you way down to like dial-up speeds we kind of know that customer is going to love their modem for like two to three days and then they're going to call us and say it doesn't work it is not us it's not our product it is the data plan that you have so that's why we recommend to folks that it's it's usually easiest to pick up a data plan with us even if it's just for a short period of time get to know your system maybe you keep it maybe you decide to go somewhere else that's okay too but you get everything up and running and you know that you have a high capacity High gigabyte data plan that can get you off to the races with no contract now once you're a bit more experienced and you're figuring this out then we also have access to carrier direct data plans and all the information you need to learn what the latest and greatest and best data plans are out there through our partnership with the mobile internet resource center now if you look at the memberships on our website at membership.mobilemustave.com those memberships are going to give you access to a lot of things Hardware discounts discount on these data plans monthly discounts so your bill is going to go down every month but it's also going to give you access to the mobile internet Resource Center the mobile internet Resource Center has an entire section dedicated just to data plans and if you go to that and then you click on router data plans it has an entire section dedicated to just plans on data plans that will work on these devices and trust me they have done all of the research it's extensive it's a pain in the butt that's why we partner with them because we can't keep up with it all to make sure that you know what the latest greatest and best deals are out there to get yourself the best possible data plan with the best carrier with the highest capacity data for the best rate okay so you've got the basics you understand full timer Speed Demon Road Warrior ultimate Road Warrior Globetrotter which lane is right for you so from this point there's a lot of Technology differences in the different bundles so you know as of the time of filming this there's the Speed Demon Cat 20 there's the speed demon 5G what's the difference between cat 20 and 5G ah make sure you check out that educational video that's going to tell you a lot about the technology differences but if you've already checked out those two videos hop over to the listing page for the specific bundle you're looking for and watch the specific video for that bundle because there's so many choices we really try to have customers start here understand what each of the lanes are so they know okay I think I really need the ultimate Road Warrior and then you can narrow your choices down to one two choices and then from there you can watch the specific videos on the different options inside of that model group and know what's a good fit or best fit for you all right folks

mobile routers for a complete internet solution that gives you redundancy with starlink and cellular internet solutions for Rock Solid reliable internet come along with us and we'll tell you all about it [Music] so mobile must have.com got pretty popular up on the Internet by doing bundles right so we took a lot of the guesswork out of mobile internet solutions by bundling all the stuff you need together into a single solution and and explaining to customers how to put it all together for a real optimal Solution that's what we've done here today with the starlink peplink mobile internet bundles and man I filled up this table I think in my last starlink only video I said I've never had this much stuff on the table now I've got even more so don't worry don't feel intimidated by all this stuff some of it you're not even going to use but I want to show you kind of what comes in all of these kits and how it all comes together for Rock Solid mobile internet connectivity all right so let's talk about what you get there's a lot here the first thing you get is you get a complete starlink high performance Mobility solution so technically if you wanted to use the starlink without any peplink routers or devices you get everything you need to do that so that gets you your high performance dish which you see here gets you your wedge mount for fixed mounting the device Up on the Roof it gets you your power injector that this big boy right here Powers up this dish and then it gets you your starlink router and then all Associated cables it also gets you the included grommet kit for installing for getting down from the roof into your your RV or marine application that starlink includes all of the screws and silicone and Loctite and mollies and everything that startling includes so everything's included from the standard fixed kind of motion or in motion starlink solution in addition to that standard kit we are going to be providing you with a peplink mobile router this is going to be like your command center your central Hub that's going to allow you to use multiple internet connections uh if if necessary to provide you a more redundant internet solution than just with starlink alone at the time of us launching we have two bundle options one is with our balance 20x mobile router which gives you a tremendous amount of flexibility we'll talk about that one in a minute and then the second one is with our br1 Pro 5G mobile router which gives you a very high performance 5G cellular modem inside side of that router that's going to control the starlink and give you access to 5G cellular for a really reliable connection the bundle kit also includes a 12 volt fused power adapter for your peplink device it also will come with standard 120 volt power bricks and everything but as part of your bundle you have the kit that allows you to direct wire this into your house batteries before we get into the how how you plug all this stuff together to make it all work let's kind of talk about the why I'm going to bring up right here my RV that's sitting right outside there and I'm going to show you my dashboard and it's going to show you how many internet connections I have available to me right now and it's quite a few I think there's 10 plus Internet solutions that I can use to connect to the internet including the starlink high performance mobile dish all through a central dashboard here that's managed by my peplink device so what is this bundle giving you giving me it's giving me the the ability to use more than one internet connection at the same time or one internet connection at the same time and then fail over to another one if the first one doesn't work or fails for some reason maybe I decided to park under a tree and my starlink's not working or there was an issue with the solar storm or something else and the starlink's not working or maybe a cell tower is down and my cellular is not working so I want to use the starlink this solution gives me the ability to do all that now if you want to combine the connections into one single redundant connection the technology is included in the peplink device it's called speed Fusion connect and it allows you to connect a any internet connection but let's say a starlink with another internet connection let's say cellular into one unified connection we have detailed guides on speed Fusion connect how to set it up and quite a bit more information available so we're going to keep this video at a high level of an overview but just so you know you can absolutely do that with these kits okay so let's talk about bundle options and the differences between going with the balance 20x that you see here or the br1 pro 5G why would you pick one okay well let's start initially with cost the balance 20x is about 40 percent cheaper than the br1 pro 5G and it has more expandability out of the box it's really kind of our most expandable mobile router so it's cheaper and it's more expandable but it doesn't have 5G out of the box so this device when you get it in our bundle kit includes an embedded modem down here this is a category 7 cellular modem this will work very well on T-Mobile at T and Verizon and you can put the SIM cards right in here you get two SIM card slots but one modem so you can connect to one cell tower at a time you also get an integrated four port switch here you get the ability to plug in a Wan device like starlink so you would plug your starlink into here we'll talk about that in a little bit you actually can convert one of these Lan ports to a second wind Port so if you had like T-Mobile home internet one of those little tin cans you wanted to use that the licensing is included with this when you purchase it to connect a second wired internet device to that you get your Wi-Fi right here two and five gigahertz Wi-Fi included right inside the kit you then get an expansion Port here this is a little mini expansion Port right now I've got a modem installed in that but you could install a 5G cellular modem inside of here and that would be in addition to the one you have down here so now you have two Cellular Connections one of them being 5G in addition to the ability to use the starlink in this bundle so now you're starting to get a lot of connections going you also have on this side a USB port you can plug a Max adapter into this USB port which will give you another 5G uh Cellular Connection or cellular modems now you've got 5G 5G and a nice 4G down here for three Cellular Connections plus you can you've got your starlink here for four connections plus you can add more via those ports so we're talking major major major expandability and you can get in at a very low price point now that said let's let's step over to the br1 pro bundle okay well if you added 5G to this you would now have a dual cellular device but you would be more expensive than if you just picked this in the first place so for a lot of customers that just want a single Cellular Connection and starlink and they want the ability to combine them together the br1 pro 5G bundle is probably the best bet for you so what do you get inside of this kit you get an embedded 5G cellular modem that's capable of four gigabits per second of speed it's a blazing fast 5G chipset in here we've done a video specific to this modem which I will link that will give you more information on that but you get your integrated Wan Port so you can plug your starlink into this you have your integrated Wi-Fi two gigahertz and five gigahertz so that will provide Wi-Fi throughout and you also get Wi-Fi 6 in this device so this has a an upgraded Wi-Fi technology that does a little bit better when you're in congested RV parks you can also convert one of these Lan ports these for connecting you know your local computer devices to a second Wan Port the licensing for that is included in the device if you wanted to connect a second cellular device like a T-Mobile home internet in addition to the starlink so pretty robust and flexible and also pretty compact it's in a very small compact package the br1 pro 5G also has a maximum throughput on the cellular side that's that's faster than the balance 20x balance 20x will max out at 150 megabits on the cellular side still plenty plenty fast likely faster than the starlink you know depending on the cellular conditions but just so you know if you want the fastest cellular speeds I would go with the br1 pro bundle all right so let's talk about how all this stuff goes together and we do have detailed wiring diagrams to explain it all but we will just sort of talk through from the roof all the way down to the Internet so you understand how it all plugs together first thing you do with this bundle is take this starlink router looks like this and set it aside you're not going to use it that's basically a consumer grade router that doesn't give you a lot of technology or flexibility and one of the benefits of the fixed Mount solution is they they give you the cables and the stuff to replace that okay so we're going to take this dish we're going to mount this up on the top of the RV and the way we do that is we take our wedge Mount here we Face the wedge mount lower point towards the front of the vehicle we then look for our cable entry point which is right there and we face that downwards also towards the front of the vehicle there are detailed mounting instructions on how this works inside of the kit but essentially you're screwing four screws down onto the roof and then you've got four screws that go up into the dish to secure it and then you've got one single cable coming down from the roof Starling includes 25 feet of this very robust cable it's about seven or eight millimeters in diameter so it's a nice big heavy duty cable and 25 feet I think is a really nice amount of cable the portable dishes that were really made for residential use came with I think it was 50 or 75 feet it was just like everyone ended up having like bundles of cable sitting around 25 feet is a nice amount to make sure you can get where you want to be on your roof and also into the media cabinet without a ton of extra slack so that's going to come down from this dish into your power supply here um it all comes pre plugged in so you know where everything plugs in you're going to plug your power supply into your regular 120 volt power then you're going to remove the router and you're going to use this optional cable here that comes with it you're going to plug it into the same port on the bottom of this power supply that the router was plugged into but now you're going to have a standard ethernet cable here on the end it's really nice that Starlight gave us everything we need here to create a more reliable redundant solution we're going to take that ethernet cable we're going to plug it into the WAN Port of our peplink and that's it we are done from a wiring perspective we're good to go obviously we've got a power up our peplink we've got to power up our starlink but other than that that is what we need to get the solution connected in terms of activation starlink gives you this little piece of paper here that has a k-i-t number on it or a kit number that kit number you will go to starlink.com you will enter your address and as soon as you enter your address you will see a new box for signing up and it will say there's a little check box that says I already have a star link and that will request this kit number that you enter in along with your billing information and details we typically see the dishes power up after you've wired everything up and it's all powered up you will see internet connectivity Within I don't know 10 or 15 minutes once they provision I think they kind of say wait a minimum of an hour but it's usually faster than that and then the dish will fire up and operate providing you have a clear view of the sky and you're in a starlink service area you'll be good to go it's that simple as always these videos are brought to you by our premium members I would highly recommend you check out memberships at

{"id": "vOx7O0_IBFk", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "mr_UWhzhaiESzG9CtVxAl9pCGzk", "transcript": "foreign starlinks high performance fixed Mount RV specific dish is here and it's big let's get this unboxed and come along with us and I'll tell you all about it [Music] all right so I think I got everything here and I'm glad I got a big table because we we need it right now okay so going over the uh stuff that you see here you've got your starlink high performance fix Mount dish here you've got your wedge Mount here for fixed mounting that to the roof of the vehicle you've got a power adapter here this essentially provides power to the dish itself then you've got the starlink router which is this box here you've got a optional cable here which will allow the starlink device to plug into a standard ethernet Jack if you're looking to combine this with a peplink solution which I highly recommend because any single internet solution that can you know go down starlink can be brought down by parking under a tree is going to be Troublesome for folks that want reliable internet so definitely look at kind of balancing this out with another solution we'll talk about that later for right now we're just going to focus on what this kit does additionally we've got a set of screws here they've provided us with some blue Loctite to uh to secure some of those screws and some branded silicone here which is for sealing your roof uh ports I don't recommend using silicone on an RV roof but that's what they've included some mollies for this is really for like masonry mollies or other stuff I'm not sure I would use that in an RV roof either but they've included it and then they have this which is a cable entry gland which we'll talk about in a bit as well that they want you to use to bring the cable down into the RV lastly we've got some some paperwork here one is specific to the wedge mount kit and how you would Mount that this one is specific to the mounts for these devices and then you've got a regulatory statement and then lastly you've got a small piece of paper that I don't have right here that includes a KT number which is like your kit number which you would use to activate service on the device that all comes in the kit from mobilemustave.com and we do ship these same day just like everything else these are in stock in our warehouse and we will ship them to you immediately almost forgot one last thing they do include in the kit is this little template which is roughly the exact size of the dish I found that this was actually kind of handy because it had the four pre-drilled holes in it uh when I was up on the roof and I was just trying to situate and figure out where this would fit best before I brought the Big Dish up on the roof so this is kind of a nice little touch that they've included as well so for those of you that are new to starlink what's the point of all this all right well starlink is essentially a low orbit satellite internet solution there's tons of news and information about it but effectively you can get high-speed internet via the starlink solution and starlink has offered National and also Global plans for folks that are traveling around the country like rvers now historically when Starlet came out the dishes were really designed for Rural home use and they had Motors in them and they typically were designed to be mounted on top of roofs or on large poles to optimally operate they really weren't designed for Mobile use there was also issues with the FCC and them being certified to be used in an RV environment fast forward to today starlink has released the high performance kit fixed mount kit that you see here and really the fundamental difference in terms of what you get versus the traditional is you get this larger dish that's going to perform more effectively now just like everything else at mobilemusstaff.com unless we specifically State otherwise we test this stuff I've had one of these dishes installed on my RV for about three months now and I've been using it and I've been pretty happy with the results overall but I use it in combination with a solution that also uses cellular internet and I augment this with additional internet connections for a very stable connection but this has really turned into one of my primary go-to solutions for internet in addition to the Cellular Connections to round out my solution for really stable reliable internet because this is a high level overview video we'll kind of keep it brief but just to give you an idea of how this would all fit together this wedge Mount here would actually operate this way and the low point of the wedge Mount would go towards the front of your RV you would then look for the cable Port here on the starlink and then put that down this way with the cable Port also facing towards the front of your RV that might seem counter-intuitive because you're driving forward and water may be able to get into the front of that Port this is how starlink has designed the solution as of today mine has not had any problems and it is the way that they recommend that we Mount the solution so this is how this would get installed Up on the Roof there are no moving parts and this will also include a snow melt heater inside of the system so if you know you get snow on the dish it will actually melt that snow and continue to operate in terms of what you do from the dish sort of down there's one cable one cable comes down from the dish it's this cable right here which is 25 feet in length that's a nice touch because the previous cables from starlink were 50 feet or yeah you could get them even longer and they just for most folks I know ended up with just a bundle of cables sitting there so because this is like a fixed Mount permanent installation 25 feet I think is a really good amount of cable that will get you connected I'm just going to talk about the standard installation method to begin with and then we'll talk about what it would look like if you wanted to integrate it into a peplink or another router solution to augment the starlink with cellular or another internet connection so to start you would take the dish here to this cable here this would be routed down through the roof of your vehicle into the RV starlink recommends that you route the cable directly below the dish through this hole right there that's located in the center of the wedge but me personally if I was going to install this in my RV I would route this into a junction box and I would go down through a central junction box where I also had other cables going down from the roof on my personal blog livinglight.net will link a video that shows you how you can create one of these junction boxes to Route these cables but really that's up to you from there you're going to go into this box which is the power supply box that's going to power this dish there's then a cable that comes out of the power supply and it goes into this starlink router this router provides the ability for the single internet connection coming out of the dish to provide internet to all of the devices inside of your RV or marine application so this is essentially like a home router it's going to provide Wi-Fi out via two gigahertz or five gigahertz Wi-Fi this does not have ethernet ports on the device so that's just something to kind of be aware of that is not included in the router it's really kind of designed to just be a Wi-Fi solution out of the gate one thing to note you are going to need 120 volt power for the power supply here and for the starlink router here if you're going to use this in kind of a standalone configuration that's how it's all going to plug in and operate another distinction with the RV specific kit is that these devices now all have these mounting brackets on them so if you look here you can pull this off and that mounting bracket now has screw holes in it making it a bit easier to mount inside of an RV application just leave that one there I'll show you the other one here's the one for the actual starlink router as well so that way you can kind of get stuff fixed mounted into a cabinet location in terms of performance and kind of what I think about the dish after using it for a couple months it's one of the best performing satellite internet Solutions I've ever used I think everybody knows that I think that starlink has has done a great job of of uh really kind of coming up with an amazing solution with this low orbit technology for things like Netflix for things like streaming for things like browsing the internet um as long as you've got a relatively decent clear line of sight to a lot of sky and it needs a lot of Sky it's not like a traditional dish where you could kind of point it between two trees it doesn't work that way you need a lot of broad Sky it works pretty pretty well I would say you know the real downside for me for starlink is similar to to most single internet Solutions is that there could be dropouts anything that's traveling through the air to provide you high-speed internet can can provide dropouts so you know I oftentimes will see in you know a 60-second window maybe one or two seconds where the internet will drop out for a minute because of coverage of satellites or you know obstructions with trees or whatever as I'm using the solution that's not a big deal for Netflix that's not a big deal for browsing the internet you typically won't see any of that stuff because of the way the technology works it is a big deal for folks that are working on the road who are relying on this for work for like voice over IP Zoom things like that that's where if if this was my only internet solution I would probably have trouble working from the road mainly for for voice and for video conferencing applications now that said I've integrated this we'll talk about this a little bit at the end and then we'll have a separate video around our starlink bundle Solutions with a peplink solution that provides redundancy for the starlink with a Cellular Connection so that if the Starlight goes down for a little bit it doesn't matter my internet connection stays completely reliable but that's for the next video but just so you know that this solution can be adapted or augmented to that type of you know more redundant solution that has more than one connection to the internet in terms of getting through your roof and getting into your your kind of interior area for the installation this is the included kind of cable grommet solution that they've they they feel like you should basically with a razor blade cut a hole in the middle of this screw this together and then drill this down onto your roof and seal it with that silicone sealant this is probably the single biggest concern I have in this kit I'm not this I wouldn't use this in my RV if I was entering a cable um just based on the fact that it's a surface mount and you have to cut away components to get the cable in it could absolutely be done just be very careful with this mounting insulation I I would you know check out the uh the the cable box installation that we have at livinglight.net where I create a surface mount wire junction box and that would be in my opinion a much better way to get the cables in to the RV but it does include this kit my recommendation would be that if you do use this to pick up a tube of dicor self-leveling roof sealant you can pick that up from mobile mustaf.com and use that instead of that silicone it's going to do a much better job of adapting as your roof expands and contracts due to variations in temperature or if someone's walking on the Roof then silicone silicone is in my opinion really just something that you use on metal roofs and other surfaces that don't have a lot of flex like RV roofs do but other than that the kit does come with everything you need to get it up and running and an alternative cable entry point solution like a box is not a high cost and for me I like it because it allows me to put other cables down the same hole without having to modify anything up on the roof over and over again that might create leaks Okay so we've talked about how this would be installed on its own using all of this equipment now how would I I install it if I was installing it in my situation or in my vehicle we'll talk about that kind of next and this will kind of be a segue into the next video which we'll talk about are bundles first thing I would do is I would get rid of this starlink router completely so I would go ahead and take this cable out take this starlink router and put it somewhere where I'm not going to use it anymore that's gone to me then I would take this cable that comes with the device which is a ethernet cable and a starlink cable on the other end and I would take the starlink cable end here plug it into that same hole that I just removed the router from cables are nice and heavy duty go ahead and mount this one box on my uh kind of my tech cabinet area make sure that this is mounted up to the dish plug this power supply into power and then plug this ethernet cable in to my mobile router which I'll show you one example here this is the router that would come in our bundle kit this is a balanced 20x I would take this cable and I would plug it right into the Wan internet input port and that would be my internet solution I get my 2.4 gigahertz five gigahertz Wi-Fi out of the peplink this has an integrated cellular modem so I could have cellular Wi-Fi and then it would manage the starlink for me and I could combine starlink and cellular into one solution or just use it as starlink only if I didn't have cellular um at that particular time you could just run just starlink through this although it kind of defeats the purpose since this device can run multiple internet Solutions but maybe if you're running just a trip and you don't want to pay for cellular data you could see how that operates and then add cellular or just turn on the cellular when you need it for a work call or something like that but this would balance out the solution and also limit the amount of 120 volt power sources that I need to plug power into since the peplinks will run on DC straight from my house batteries and then I just have to worry about powering up the one power supply here that will power the dish so to each his own it doesn't really matter I just wanted to explain how this kit can provide additional flexibility right out of the box and explain what this cable is for folks that don't understand why there's an ethernet cable that doesn't look like it's going to plug into anything that comes with the Starlight kit because it won't to kind of give you a quick sneak peek here's a screenshot of my dashboard on my peplink inside of my RV and as you can see here I have I think I have almost 10 internet connections including the starlink high performance fixed Mount dish this is for me really how I am able to work from the road I've got multiple connections to the internet and that that that's just a reason why I think that you'd want to integrate a peplink router as your kind of Central Command Center to manage the starlink connection so you have a lot more redundancy and flexibility as always this video is brought to

tremendous amount of features previously unavailable and it's out and available for testing now come along with us and we'll tell you all about it [Music] com and the mobile internet Resource Center as always this video is brought to you by our premium members if you haven't done so already I highly encourage you to check out our premium memberships at membership.mobilemustave.com for discounts access to the mobile internet resource center and much deeper dive information about what we're going to talk about today but make sure you check out the detailed news story article at the mobile internet Resource Center which we will link to below before we get started one piece of interesting housekeeping information a lot of people refer to these as peplinks a lot of them people refer to these as pep waves what exactly is the difference well way back in the day when these products were launched the marketing department at peplink decided that they wanted to see two different products one that was focused on sort of your wired based connectivity links pep links and one based on your wireless technology cellular being the primary Wireless technology that link devices use pep wave wave for wireless wave so that's basically the difference as of 2023 peplink is doing away with the pep wave name okay so let's talk about some improvements to the interface and I'll bring my admin console uh up into into view here so I can start sharing my screen with you the first thing you'll notice in what you see here is whoa there's a lot of Wan connections or internet connections this is not some fancy super high-end expensive setup here beyond what our normal customers would operate with but this is showing you the two devices that are sitting here on my desk that are connected together and what you'll notice is that there's a lot of Wan connections showing up and that's because of a new feature called Synergy mode that will get to into in a minute but before we start with that I want to show you some Basics on kind of what has changed in the interface now here on the high level on this primary screen you may notice that the details button that's located next to each connection is gone it's not there anymore what they've done is they've actually replaced the details button with these small quick reference pop-out windows that you'll see here that will show you the IP address of that particular connection if you click on one of those pop-outs it'll bring up a details tab there that allows you to kind of have quick reference to some of the basic information now don't worry the details tab with all of those detailed settings and configuration items is still available you simply need to click on the name of the connection which you'll see is underlined on the left and that will bring up your full Wan connection setting details as you scroll down you'll also notice that they've changed how you connect to the wireless Wan and they've changed it out to have a small little kind of picture of a wireless icon with a pencil on it to designate that it's you know you can edit the connection that you're connected to um that used to just say Wi-Fi networks so they've changed that around a little bit so if you see an old guide or you're not sure where that button went it is there scrolling down for a bit one thing that they've changed is under the Wi-Fi AP section they've added a section that actually tells you which frequency your various networks or ssids are broadcasting on and for customers that are troubleshooting you know older Legacy devices or they want to specifically use two gigahertz or five gigahertz this is a nice feature that they've added to this dashboard screen that will show you what frequency each SSID is broadcasting on next to the dashboard tab you might notice that the speed Fusion Cloud icon is now called speed Fusion protect or sfc protect speed Fusion connect protect there's a lot that went into that but the back story really is that they want you to understand that speed Fusion can connect you to various internet connections all at the same time and because it's using a VPN tunnel it's also protecting your traffic when you're using all these various Wan connections that's really the back story of it but for all intensive purposes speed Fusion Cloud speed Fusion connect speed Fusion protect speed Fusion connect protect they all mean the same thing which is peplinks proprietary technology that allows you to combine multiple connections all together into one resilient connection that can improve the reliability and speed of your internet connection a really key feature to why these routers are so popular okay so let's talk about Synergy mode and all these Wan connections I think we've got one two I think we've got 10 connections between these these two mobile routers since they're connected together and that is just so so cool all right so real world scenario where is this going to be valuable to our customers the vast majority of customers will have purchased the device over the last three years and they may be looking to add additional connections or maybe they want to add 5G and Synergy mode gives you the ability to pick up an you know an entry level 5G device like the br1 pro 5G and integrate that into your existing connections so you'd go from having two connections if you were with a duo or one single connection if you had one of the older mk2s or Minis and you'd up that to two or three connections and you'd include 5G in your setup the benefits of synergy mode don't just stop at the Cellular Connections though you're passing through all of the connections that were available in that secondary device to your primary device so that means you will be able to have an additional Wan Port most likely so if you wanted to connect starlink or something else you could connect that Downstream a bit and you're also going to have additional Wi-Fi as Wan connections or the ability to connect to public Wi-Fi with your various devices so you're really looking at effectively combining the complete complete wow internet connection feature set of two devices into one single dashboard for ease of use and management Synergy mode really solves one of the bigger challenges that people had when they were trying to connect a dual modem or dual internet based device Downstream or secondary to a primary 5G device and really what that was is that when you went to try to combine all the connections with speed Fusion it didn't understand how to deal with the second modem connection on that secondary router that may have gone over everybody's head that's okay the point of what I'm trying to say is that with Synergy mode now all of your connections will show up on that single dashboard all you have to do is drag them into Priority One and after you configure speed Fusion connect or speed Fusion Cloud they are going to operate all like they did as if they were in one single device so what makes Synergy Mode work this ethernet cable that's all you need um this in this particular setup this Transit is acting as my primary and you'll notice the cable is connected to the Lan port and this ubr is acting as my secondary and you'll notice that it's connected to the WAN Port we have a detailed or a high level setup video that we did just a little while back that we can link to in the description on how to enable Synergy mode and we'll also link our detailed article on Synergy mode at the mobile internet Resource Center as well if you want to dive deeper into how to get this all set up and going another great feature of the 8.3 release is something that really affects for most of our customers the balance 20x device and that is the ability to have much more visibility if you're using one of these which is called a Max adapter what a Max adapter is the it's a USB cellular modem essentially it takes SIM cards directly into it it has its own antenna ports and then it has a USB port here that can connect up to your balance 20x USB port here now previous to 8.3 it was very limited information about the connection that you could see and it didn't really operate like an embedded cellular modem you were kind of limited to what you could see things like single signal strength and what you really wanted to do to dive into to diagnose what was going on with that USB connection we're highly limited with 8.3 those features have been unlocked and this Max adapter really acts just like an integrated cellular modem so that really makes any peplink device that has a USB port super super exciting we're going to get into a bit more on what's happening with the balance 20x in a bit because there are some major changes to this device that make it a serious serious Contender for the mobile enthusiasts with the addition of 8.3 before I forget you can also enable band selection via at the USB cellular modems now with 8.3 so like I said really acting like an integrated cellular module at this point even though it's operating on that USB port band selection was a huge missing component prior to 8.3 peplink has also enabled a feature called two antenna mode which is really applicable to some of their later generation devices like category 20 or better where there were four antenna ports on a single cellular modem or cellular module inside of the router what two antenna mode does is it allows you to disable the third and fourth antenna or the auxiliary one and two antennas in the mobile router so that the device can operate with just two antennas so if you have an older generation roof antenna that you installed or maybe you're trying to take advantage of a pre-installed cellular roof antenna and you don't you know want to replace it or you just want to test that out first you can do that now with two antenna mode note that it will cost you some performance by disabling those two additional antennas but it is an option now that you can toggle on and off for added flexibility with these mobile routers the next major feature that's changed in 8.3 is the addition of the virtual Wan licensing which is now including one virtual land license inside of PrimeCare what is virtual Wan well it's essentially the ability for you to add a or change really a lan Port which was previously a port that you would just connect to a local computer or device and convert that to a Wan Port so that you can connect an external wired internet source into that Lan Port why would you want an additional Wan Port well perhaps you're looking to add starlink to your setup and maybe you want to add T-Mobile home internet as well now those Technologies all have drawbacks to them but they also have huge advantages usually around just having a lot of gigabytes of data available to you if you're in the right location where they can function but you know unplugging plugging and swapping cables and changing settings is all stuff we don't want to deal with so virtual Wan allows you to connect those both at the same time and if you're using Synergy mode like this you may already have tied up one of your Wan ports so the ability to have an additional virtual Lan Port means you can connect something like a starlink downstream and still have enough ports to connect everything together so that you're retaining that Central single dashboard for managing all of your connections peplink again has included one of those virtual van licenses in PrimeCare but you must maintain your Prime Care subscription for that to be enabled and you can also add additional virtual Lan ports via the virtual Wan paid license as well okay so we're wrapping up this video I know I threw a lot at you but there's one more huge exciting update with 8.3 and that is the major change just happening to the balance 20x and the balance 20x category 7 which came out a little bit later from the previous generations as of 8.3 the balance 20x is now running the same operating system optimized for Mobile use in this package so what does that mean that means your dashboard is much easier to use like with the other devices you can drag and drop your connections as you could before but what it also means is that it's enabled Wi-Fi as when on the balance 20x so you can connect to Marina and Campground Wi-Fi so now I think we might be really close to having like the perfect or close to perfect low-cost Central Command Center device for mobile connectivity users you've got something that's way I mean I think it's 579 for the latest version retail wise that obviously probably could change and it has Wi-Fi Wan the ability to plug in a wired internet connection the wire the virtual win so then you have a second wired interconnection the onboard category 7 modem as of the foaming of this the expansion slot to add 5G here and then the USB port to add a second 5G here all in a chassis that started out at such a low price point this is really something that is super excited exciting for the mobile connectivity Universe right now something that you can have all of this expandability customization and flexibility in and now it's finally running the correct operating system to allow it to really Shine for mobile users but make sure you check out the detailed news story article at the mobile internet Resource Center which we will link to below alright so that is the summary overview of 8.3 and I know it was a lot to take in but it's a big update and they've made a lot of changes that are going to help our mobile Community stay

{"id": "zaU1khg_8y8", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "YGbpWY883pMObC5gXu5t5H9zv84", "transcript": "the balance 20x has gone through a pretty massive transformation uh with the release of firmware 8.3 come along with us and we'll tell you all about it [Music] so the balance 20x has always been a really kind of interesting and unique uh device but it's been a balanced series device which balance is kind of always the way I've looked at it is a balanced device is a home office or it's an Enterprise device it really wasn't designed for Mobile use the way that most of the software and the layout in the device is kind of optimized is for cellular or Wireless connectivity to be the backup if like your cable modem or something fails and that really just makes them not operate as well for the mobile Community we've been pushing with peplink for a while to move the balance 20x to something that's really a lot more Mobility friendly with 8.3 they have delivered and the way they delivered is that they moved the balance 20x from the balance operating system over to the traditional Mobility operating system that we see in like the br1 series and the transit series mobile devices by switching the this over to the mobility operating system it's allowed them to enable certain features that weren't in the balance operating system one of the key ones being now the device supports Wi-Fi as Wan or the ability to connect to public Campground marina or home Wi-Fi or even a phone hotspot Wi-Fi and use that as one of your internet connections so with 8.3 the balance 20x now has Wi-Fi when 8.3 is done quite a bit more though for the balance 20x but before we go into kind of what the new stuff is why did we like the router in the first place well the balance 20x has a lot of stuff that some of the other Mobility devices doesn't have one it has a USB port here which is a port that can be used to expand your Wan sources or your internet connection sources we'll talk about that in a minute it has an integrated switch here a four port switch which allows you to connect a lot more wired device devices and then it has this expansion Port I've got a a modem right here installed in this expansion Port it's called a mini Flex module this is a category 12 but you can install a 5G in there as well so you have the ability to expand the connections with that Flex module and it had an integrated additional cellular modem down here at the bottom that that made it really kind of like a great all-around device but it had some shortcomings that integrated modem down here was a category 4 modem up until very recently and we sat down with peplink and we said guys our customers just need to see more than category four it's not giving us the throughput or the access to the newer cellular bands that are so important for mobile users so they upgraded this to a category seven cellular modem and category seven while not 5G has rounded out the access to Cellular bands to make it a really really attractive modem for customers at a very low and aggressive price point keep in mind this device as of the filming of this video is a sub 600 device and it has all of this expandability making it really just a top top pick for us next the operating system was the second kind of shortcoming and we've talked about how that has been dressed yes third we had no Wi-fi when that has been addressed yes fourth this USB port here really it it allowed you to connect an additional uh cellular modem this is what's called a Max adapter from peplink but you it didn't act like an embedded or integrated cellular modem it gave you very little functionality and you couldn't do things like band selection and and and really most of the key features that are why people want to invest in in a in a high-end internet solution like this so those were the shortcomings that that had us kind of steering our customers towards some of the other devices all of them are solved with the release of 8.3 let's get into that now and I'll kind of show you what this thing's capable of now that the software has been upgraded okay so first off on the USB modem side yes when you connect a Max adapter to a balance 20x it now acts just like it's integrated into the device so you get full customization all the information about that connection and it's acting just like an embedded device the same goes for the flex module here that was always the case but just to confirm so now with this device sub 600 device I've got a category seven really good all-around cellular modem down here I can expand here and add 5G and then you can add another USB 5G modem all into this Central Command Center so you've got one 5G connection another 5G connection the onboard category 7 connection and you've still got the Wi-Fi Wan which gives you two simultaneous connections to public Wi-Fi on two gigahertz or five gigahertz networks plus you've got the win Port here so that's six simultaneous connections to the internet in a sub uh 600 router all that give you because this is now a Prime Care SKU um that all give you access to speed Fusion connect or speed Fusion protect um so you can combine all those connections into a single unified connection that's just that's just awesome um it's just it's unheard of for this price point in addition with firmware 8.3 they've unlocked the virtual Wan connection for one virtual land license which means that it actually will allow you to convert one of these Lan ports to a Wan port a secondary Wan Port which means you can have two wired internet connections on this device just with your active Prime Care subscription meaning you have a total of seven internet connections in this device and if you want an additional wired Wan connection on the device you can add them with additional virtual Wan licenses uh the sky is kind of the limit it's it's pretty awesome so what does that mean for the average customer or if you're new to this channel well this would be a really good device for folks that might be looking at um you know trying to save some money right out of the gates but possibly looking to combine starlink and cellular and then have a lot of expandability uh going forward so I mean what we're talking about is you would be able to plug in starlink let's say into your Wan Port you could plug in you know T-Mobile home internet into your secondary Wan Port both of those have a lot of limitations in terms of location or you know tree covers or stuff like that but they have high bandwidth and high you know high bandwidth allotments High gigabit allotments on their data plans so those could be some interesting connections here you could then complement those with a integrated cellular data plan here or through the expansion module if you wanted to invest in that for 5G or the USB port if you wanted to go with a Max adapter just a ton of flexibility and you don't have to buy any of these components right out of the game it's a very modular system that makes it just just easier to swallow when you're getting started and you're not 100 sure what's going to work for you in your travel and you're kind of where you go and how you travel but you kind of know that you're not going to get locked into a corner or a place where you're going to feel bad that you bought something because

{"id": "-iXI284YKy4", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "4FhV_6_jpctMKcDpLn-XSFVSWdY", "transcript": "hi guys this is Andy from mobile must have in this video we're going to talk about a new feature from peplink called Synergy mode [Music] so Synergy mode is going to be on the latest firmware from peplink it's on 8.3 at the time of this video dropping I am running the beta version kind of testing and showing how this works but it should be coming out in days if you're watching this right when we launch this video this feature is all about bonding two peplinks together so if you have one already and you wanted to add a second one for either more coverage another data plan um just kind of just more options there's a really easy way to do that now and control everything from one interface and that's what the key feature is here so first we're going to talk about the use cases for it then I'll show you my setup and kind of go over some of the hardware requirements to set this up and then go over the software interface for it too don't worry this isn't Tech heavy it's actually pretty simple to do it's really the most complicated thing is just getting to peplink devices and they're pretty easy to link after that so first let's talk about use cases this is all about adding and expanding your ability to connect to other things if you have something like a Transit duo or a dual modem device adding a third device you can now add a 5G router you can add just another router to get Verizon 18t and T-Mobile for example you can have all three there's a lot of different reasons why you might want to do this this is a really great way to add a 5G modem to something like a Transit and we can talk about a couple different options there but this is now really a great way to do that from a physical setup standpoint I'll go over my particular setup but we're going to do some generic terms here the main router that you typically connect to that has speed vision set up on has all your your main system set up on we're going to call that our primary router and then there's going to be a second router right this is the one we're adding into our main Network and we'll call that a secondary router uh it doesn't really matter which ones you use I would use your latest router your newest one as your primary if we're looking at something like the transit Duo and then comparing that to like a br1 pro the br1 pro is going to have faster processors it's going to have a faster kind of memory overall and that's might be a better system to use as your primary Hub over a older generation still very capable but older generation device you might just get better performance on that so look at the latest device make sure the one with the best specs is maybe set up as your primary especially now that you can control everything the one with the best specs is probably going to be your better primary router in my particular example here and my setup I am in the middle of upgrading my internet and RV to a br2 which is a dual 5G modem very excited I have a whole playlist I'm prepping to show you guys kind of my installation my upgrade process we're doing new antennas we're bringing starlink really cool so I'll link um that playlist here once once we get that going but my primary is going to be in br2 and then I'm connecting a br1 as a secondary router now to connect these two everything needs to have power and antennas like always there's no change there they are going to be functioning independently so make sure both of them can get their own power and they have all the antennas they need now the key thing for connecting them is where to put the ethernet cable you do need to have an ethernet cable to do Synergy mode and what we're going to do is we're going to take the secondary router and we're going to plug in the Lan Port Lan and then we're going to go into the WAN Port of your primary device so basically Lan is internet out so we're going to take the internet out of the secondary and it's going to go in as a source an internet source into the WAN Port of our primary device and that's all we're going to do from a hardware standpoint we want to make sure everything's turned on and we're going to leave it like that for now now we're going to move to the software side of the setup we've done our Hardware we've connected our ethernet and now we're going to move to the computer so let's jump in this is going to be the console our login our admin page to our primary device like I said before I'm running a br2 that is a dual modem device so I have two cell modems this also has support for USB modem which you may or may not have depending on your device and we can see a lot of other options I've got currently disabled down below but this is a stock this is a I've just factory reset this device so it's all very very basic at this point you do need to make sure both of your devices are running 8.3 and if you want to start you don't have to factory reset yours I did that for this particular demo but you do need to factory reset the secondary device which we'll get to in a second first step for here is really quite simple um we just want to confirm that everything is kind of connected so I've got my my cell one and cell two connected we can see those US1 USB one is good that's connected the main thing we're looking for is my Wan one that is where I've connected the ethernet cable into Wan one for my primary and it goes to the Lan of the secondary we can see that's in standby if I drag that into Priority One it um it turns green so we see it's connected it's connected to the internet but we really can't see what it's connecting to we can't if I click into it it gives me standard wand information but that's all it's really giving me it's it's all local to the BR to my primary device the Second Step here is we're going to factory reset our secondary device um you can use it a couple ways you can while it's powered on you can hold the reset button down for 20 seconds you'll see the the status light turn a solid red and then you can wait for that to boot back up before you do a factory reset I do suggest grabbing a configuration file assuming you've already set that device up that way if you ever need to fall back to how it was already done the configuration file you can upload it and film everything all Wi-Fi settings password everything kind of re-uploads super easy but for this particular sake secondary device starting from a factory reset is the easiest way to go once that secondary device is factory reset on the primary device so again the screen I'm already on I'm going to go over to Network I'm going to go down on the left side to WAN and then the very bottom is our new feature it is the Synergy controller I'm going to change that to enabled on Wan 1. you might only have one Wan select that one if you want to do it on both because you're connecting a lot of stuff you can do that I only need it on my first Wham so that's what I'm going to select and I'm going to hit save and then up at the top I'm going to hit apply changes now uh pep wave says this can take up to five minutes you might have to be patient making that factory reset of your secondary device up front will definitely speed this up too um and you can see like mine's already sync that's how fast it was in real time with us all set so let's look at what basically this does for us so now the big change here is I still have cell one cell two USB just as before but instead of Wan one I now see a new cellular option it's labeled number four kind of down here on the status and then it says cellular and then basically a serial number that's the serial number of my br1 my secondary device and now I can see that's connected to Verizon Wireless so and then if I look down from there when one connected to a serial number so I can even see it starts to say Synergy right there so now instead of just seeing when one and that's connected to some other source right I can now see that's connected to a pep link and I can control those wam sources directly so if I didn't want that cell to be active I can put it into priority two and it's now standby um so that's really really cool I can now control what that is and that's really important if you're in an area that doesn't have coverage from maybe Verizon and or it's really saturated and you want to turn ryzen off it just makes it really really easy to manage now it's all in one place but not only am I able to manage to sell stuff here I'm also able to manage that Wi-Fi as Wan via that device I'm also able to manage as Wan Port so if there was another Wan port for let's say starlink and I needed one or a T-Mobile home or whatever you're using you now have another Wan Port that you can kind of help merge all this stuff together so it gives you a lot of flexibility you can control that now all from one particular place and that's the key thing here all right guys if you have any questions feel free to reach out to us on email and info mobilestaff.com we are also available live with a human person on chat on our website too which you can find in the bottom right hand corner alright guys hope to see you guys all on the road bye [Music]", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2023-01-12T15:41:41Z", "channelId": "UCE9KnGK2TcpXLlIi5cQfGvg",

{"id": "A5k2fD6JYvc", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "Obu8vWgrgOb-pizXpsYcbbce8Ec", "transcript": "hi guys this is Andy from mobile must have and in this video we're talking about water filtration bundles [Music] we're going to go over basically what is in our water filtration bundles how they work what you're going to get out of it and why they are a great purchase at mobile must have we're talking about the Blue Tech 0.2 Micron filtration solution with a couple of accessories a optional water softener depending on which bundle you're looking at and why that is a great add-on to your RV now this is the exact system I've been using for the last couple months testing and living with and running my day-to-day water operations through and I have been extremely impressed and am very happy to have this on board today we're going to talk about the bundle and basically what you get in that now I'll say up front there are two kind of Campground filtration bundles the elite is going to be all of this with the water softener then there's the premium that is going to be all of this without the water softener and then the hose that connects that extra stage to it that's really going to be the only difference everything is based on a 25 foot hose filters the MR3 three and kind of those accessories which we'll talk about so um let's talk about first the MR3 and the filters that come with it if you haven't already watched our general overview video about the blue technology water filtration system at mobile must have I'm going to link that here it's definitely worth watching it's not that long and that will give you a good overview kind of of what Blue Tech is why we're really excited about having it uh and so so it's a good video to start with that said I'll do a quick overview basically this is a three-stage water filtration system the main part of it is going to be their 0.2 Micron filtration filter that stands at the end of kind of this full solution and that's going to take out everything that's bigger than 0.2 microns that is small so this is going to take out sand and dirt of course but it's also going to take out a lot more of the scarier stuff that's bacteria viruses gerardia all kinds of scary stuff I'll leave like a quick graph here that's what this is designed to take out now the second stage in this is going to be focused on taste and smell that is focused on removing um chlorine and basically making sure that you just don't have that nasty kind of dirty water smell that's going to be the second stage and the first stage is all about longevity this is taking out some of those larger particles up front so it doesn't clog your filters later in the systems everything lasts longer and so it's a great app so that is going to be your primary three stages for this it comes with the filters already installed so we get this out of the box you don't see the filters Don't Panic they're already built in you don't have to do anything the filters are designed to last four to six months that's going to depend on how much you use the water and your water source overall if you're in really dirty water and you've got lots of sand and dirt it's going to kind of clog these up faster but four to six months is the expected kind of life cycle of these I change mine out every six months or on pretty clean water and I haven't had any issues that said even in north Texas we're on City water it's still taking stuff out these are still definitely changing colors when I change them out so really glad we have this system now that's going to be the MR3 that is included it is a stainless steel frame it has the r connect system which we'll talk about in a bit included what's really great about this filter housing is how easy it is to change the filters you don't need one of those big filter wrenches it comes with a small little tool however if you lose that because it is a small little tool you can use really just a screwdriver just to kind of break the main seal on on this top ring and you can hand tighten or hand loosen the rest if you even need the tool so really easy to change these out we have a we have a video on changing filters which I'll link here once that's made now after your main once the water goes through your filter where you can get the softener if you like it this has made a huge difference for us in Texas we have pretty heavy like like hard water really makes your hands feel dry this has solved a lot of those problems it's also made our clothes feel softer there's just a lot of benefits to having the water softener I'll list those out here on the screen so having the water softener has been great there is a bit of a setup process so if you're interested in how to set that up make sure you read the instructions that come with it we'll also do a video on that too but the water softener is a great add-on to that the best thing about it is you just need regular table salt to recharge it it's really easy to do as well it's a really low cost to maintain over its life cycle and very easy even if in a remote place basically you just need table salt and you can recharge the water softener now it comes with a couple of accessories that really make this a full solution and not just like oh I got most of this on Amazon and now I need the rest what's great about this is the main thing which I have traveled with forever and love that this comes with it you're going to have a high flow pressure regulator that goes right up at your kind of your spigot it's a Quick Connect into the r system which we'll talk about um and now you know that basically the water coming into your system isn't going to over pressurize one on your filters but then two anything in your RV so you can you can pick whether you want higher or lower pressure with these they're adjustable this is like a key thing I say to travel with one also note here is everything that water touches is going to be stainless steel minus the filters themselves this is food grade stainless steel that is what the canisters are in the actual soft or in the filter itself that's what the softener is made out of this cool nice little shiny thing it's all made out of food grade stainless steel as well as the actual accessories and the hoses so you're water isn't touching brass it's not touching plastic it's a really nice way to keep your water clean and safe through the whole process now if you're getting the full system with the water softener you're then going to get two of these smaller five foot hoses they have these quick connects on them so this is the r connect system from Blue Tech and it's the best thing basically all of it everything will have this it'll come with one so you can put it on your main your main thing that you connect to your spigot this will actually have a y connect which is the only thing I wasn't given kind of when before the bundles were put together but it is going to be a y connect you twist that onto the source the campground your house then there is a quick connect basically right onto your hose so you you twist your y connect onto the source and then to put your hose on it's that easy you're just really you're squeezing and you're pushing them on these are really high-end quick connects I've been using them for over a year we haven't had any leaks or any issues with them they're heavy duty materials and they are all stainless steel they are designed to not have any issues in the long run so they're very easy to take on and take off I love these bundles because they do have everything that you need included so if you bought your RV and you have nothing this you don't need to buy anything extra you can buy this bundle it can get you basically from the campground spigot or your house speaker however you're testing this and it can get clean fresh water into your RV you don't need to buy anything else and that's kind of what we focused on getting this bundle put together now the filters like I said will come basically pre-installed so you don't have to do that your first round if you need Replacements we sell those on the store you can buy that with just the standard white kind of 0.2 micron filter you can also get the off-grid filter solution same thing it's got the 0.2 Micron has a couple little extra features on it it's still at 0.2 Micron but both of those recharge packs will work for you as well there are a couple other accessories you can look at if you just want a pressure gauge I put that at the end of my filter before the softener and what that does is that allows me to see the pressure coming in from the campground with our high flow pressure regulator valve right I can see what it's setting to and then this tells me how much the pressure is coming out of my filter you can also get this really nice basically spigot so if you have an extra hose that you'd want to attach this to it comes with the rconnect system so if you need to quickly kind of turn off the water to the RV and then spray the hose dogs or whatever it's a really nice add-on all right guys now if you have any questions about anything you see here uh and you want more information you can always chat with us or email us um directly I'll leave that information here and Chats on our website we also are now offering consultations so you can go to talk.mobilemustave.com and you can sign up for a consultation with an expert we'll call you we'll set up a time and you can go over and you can ask them any question you want about water but we also have remember internet and fire and Tire products if you have any questions about those too that's a great use for those consultations now my last comment is going to be a great resource if you're

{"id": "o-XgUYx3SqE", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "2snY5sqUj1k80-oAjvp535oMGz4", "transcript": "hey guys this is Andy from mobile mustav and in this video we're going to go over our Campground filtration solutions from Blue technology [Music] now in this video I'm focusing on Campground water filtration systems I'm using Campground Loosely this could be your house it's basically any like pressurized water source coming in or through your filter so it's going to be flowing through some spigots and that's where these Solutions kick in there are other options that are going to be on board water so one that is in line let's say if you want to build it into your plumbing there's also some that have integrated pumps for more off-grid water filtration I'll link those videos here and there's a full playlist for our water filtration Solutions here at mobile must have now we're going to break this video down into kind of three main groupings first we're going to talk about the difference of housings then we're going to talk about the different filters and what they all mean in the difference between two and three stage filters and of course talk about the 0.2 micron filter which this whole solution is made around and then end with my favorite feature which is the rconnect system as an rver now let's dive in to the filter housings you can see there's two main different types of units I have here with me and don't this is not their only ones this is just what I have on board and can show you kind of as demo units we'll first start with this one this is going to be this physical unit is called the R2 but it does come in a three-stage filter configuration too what's great about this one is it's really really lightweight it's 3D printed plastic with aluminum Framing and then you have your stainless steel filter housings so everything that touches the water itself is going to be stainless steel minus the filters themselves and but it's a really really great option super lightweight very compact overall and again you can get this in the two stage or the three-stage option this is the one I have currently on my RV and this is the MR3 this right now is only available in the three stage however in the future we're gonna we're hoping to get a two stage of this but right now it's just a three stage um and this one is all stainless steel so it's going to be a bit heavier but it's a bit smaller this also has mounting where you can just kind of mount it on a rack if you wanted to store it that way or if you wanted to build it into your system you could do that um with this one if you wanted to again with this one everything that touches water is stainless steel they both use the Quick Connect system or the r connect system so very very easy to work with um you have the same filter housings on both of them like I said everything is stainless steel but that's really the difference between the two filter housing so you're gonna have a light kind of uh really nice compact one this one's going to be all stainless steel looks really sharp especially next to the stainless steel water softener a little bit more compact but it's a little bit heavier so whichever unit you think is kind of the right fit for you um they're both they both have a lot of good options for them now let's move into filters so between your two and three stage they're going to be using very similar filters the main difference in the three stage is you're going to have your first stage is going to be a sediment filter this is designed to pull out High bigger particles like dirt and sand that are larger and it's going to extend the rest of the life of the other two filters which are the same now for the rest of these two units the second filter is going to be a taste filter and that is designed to basically make the water taste and smell better it's focusing on removing chlorine and it's using a charcoal coconut filter to do that and then the final one is going to be your safety filter this is a 0.2 micron filter and I'm going to put up a quick graphic here it's the best way to explain this as far as what this is going to be taking out so if you see at the top you're going to see big human hair it's super gross but then it's going to get progressively smaller as it goes down that page again the filter we're looking at is a 0.2 micron filter so if you start at the top after the human hair you've got sand you've got some dirt up there it's going to progressively get smaller you're going to see pollen Midway down then you're going to continue to go down you're going to see like a wildfire smoke particles that are going to be in there then you're getting down to really small things like bacteria and viruses all bigger than 0.2 microns so this filter is taking out a ton a ton of stuff that we really don't want in our water and really great to have on board now these filters are all considered high flow rate filters so you are not going to be reducing your flow to a unusual rate we shower with this on every every ounce of water that goes through RV is being passed through these filters and we have not noticed a difference in our water flow whatsoever so even though they're small super compact we're still getting that really high flow rate we need for our daily lives now there's one different thing with the filter we want to talk about we actually have two options for our safety filter there's going to be the standard filter and then there's going to be the off grid filter the off-grid filter is going to come standard with all the off-grid filters filter housings that is so that's going to be like your MRX and we'll link we'll link that video here but these are a great options they are both rated for 0.2 Micron but this is just going to be your standard filter and this one is your off-grid filter this one's been third party tested this one's been certified and has all of kind of that testing done from the manufacturing both are available in the in a dual kind of a reload pack if you want to reload your filters or the the triple kind of Trio pack here so if you'd like um the standard filter or you would like the off-grid filter they are both options to buy now let's talk about my absolute favorite feature which is the r connect or quick connect system that comes with all of these Blue Tech filter housings now I'm showing you of the housings but all of the accessories hoses everything in this kind of ecosystem of water is going to use this system which is what makes your setup revolutionary with this kind of filter system so a quick overview of what the r connect system is it is a high high-end heavy duty Quick Connect I'll show you right here in front of me this is going to be my my MR3 and this is the auxiliary hose they give us and it just you push it in and it snaps in and you're done no twisting no turning it is about 50 degrees where I am and now my hands are cold turning kind of a spigot in would be painful and and now it's just so easy to get in and out I have used this exact filter housing for over a year with the arcanic systems never had a leak they're super heavy duty very high end and when it's done for me in my setup is I can now get set up in about two minutes that is including all my accessories my water softener the water filter and connecting into my RV so it's about four hoses yeah four hoses in that particular system and it just makes it super simple and I'm not sitting there threading dealing with leaks and trying to replace O-rings all the time it has really solved and just made that process so so simple what's great about it too is you can get these five foot hoses that just make connecting everything really easy and they're the perfect size to go from you know either your filter to the uh to the water softener or from the filter directly into your water Bay you can see here mine that just sits on the floor there the arcanic system for me is absolutely my favorite part of the whole system just because it makes it so easy now there's a safety aspect of it too very very important but then from a setup standpoint this is just what what sells it for me is just having this ease ability of doing all these Quick Connect systems into itself and a quick easy setup here is just a kind of quick time lapse of me I'm setting up my particular unit basically the only time you have to ever screw something in is to the Water Source itself so I do that with my Y connector it already has the quick connect on it for my high flow pressure regulator also an accessory from Blue technology see I then connect my hose and then at the other side now my Water Bay we're going to do my my zero g hose into the water filter itself from the water filter into the softener the softener then up into the RV and we're done couldn't be easier than that only had to twist on one hose to get this whole system working now mobile must have what I'm really excited we were able to do is put together a water bundle for you so if you're interested in these and that's great but you don't have accessories to buy or what else you need to get it's actually like be installed or working with your particular RV our bundle is a great option the bundle is designed so if you have bought your RV today and you have nothing to start with you can get our bundle shipped to you and it has everything you need to get basically from the Water Source at your Campground all the way to inside your RV it's got all the hoses it's got the filters it's got everything you need to get started so you can check out those bundles I will link them in the description or up here depending on how you're watching this particular video now I know this was a lot to go over so there's a couple ways you can reach out to us if you do have any questions you can always email us here at info mobile must-have.com and we'll be happy to email you back you can chat with a live representative in full human on our website and you can hit chat at the bottom right hand corner and now you can set up a consultation and kind of a scheduled callback time where you can can talk to an expert on our team and that can be about any product not just the water filters and bundles today but if you have questions on internet or fire or tire pressure systems you can talk to somebody and get any information that you need from one of our experts on our team now my last comment is going to be a great resource if you're looking to save some money and get some discounts on products if you are a member of mobile must have you not only get discounts on Hardware but you can also get discounts on monthly data plans you get faster shipping you get access to more educational material there

{"id": "OjofNRpEuxw", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "B4od0tnM-1rN4xmdMluiPkk1Ys4", "transcript": "hey folks Eric from mobilemustave.com here and this is our RV that we've been traveling in for the better part of two years that we work and play from on the road now this motorhome is equipped with our ultimate Road Warrior VR2 internet package and what that does is that gives us up to five simultaneous connections to the internet for us we utilize two Cellular Connections and one connection to starlink that we use as a backup we've covered this in a previous video but a big question folks ask us a lot is how we configure all of those connections to connect together into one connection the technology is called speed Fusion or speed Fusion connect and today's video we're going to show you how to set that up in under five minutes come with us and we'll show you how it's done foreign [Music] tutorial so if you've purchased the device from us or someone else you can go ahead and follow along and this will help you get connected one note though you are going to need a device that supports speed fusion and that's just about any device that we have in terms of our mobile internet bundles but it's going to work best if you have a device that currently has more than one internet connection but if you have like a br1 pro 5G or any other single modem devices chances are you can use speed Fusion you're just going to have to pick up a second internet source from somewhere that might be starlink that could potentially be an external small hotspot or it could be a campground Wi-Fi source if that is something that you have available that's a reliable connection but it's kind of cold out here because it's November so I'm going to hop inside and we're going to go straight to my desktop and I'm going to show you how to get this configured Welcome to our home thanks for joining us so today we're going to cover a couple different things but all of it is around speed Fusion cloud also known as speed Fusion connect also known as speed Fusion protect peplink's been messing around with the names a little bit but all of these acronyms or words connect protect and Cloud all refer to the technology that is allowing you to bond multiple internet connections together so whatever you see them called online we're all talking about the same thing today we're going to go through two different ways to configure speed Fusion connect now the first way is using the wizard and it is super super simple as I promised you before you can configure speed Fusion connect in under five minutes now the primary customer that would use this setup is somebody who is looking to connect devices via Wi-Fi or the wireless network to their peplink device and utilize multiple connections at the same time now the the Wizard does have some limitations if you start to look at enabling wired devices devices that are using the ethernet ports on the device so in those configurations we're going to do a manual configuration of speed Fusion connect it's still super simple and we're going to go through all of the steps needed today to get the manual configuration as well so we'll put chapter links Down Below in terms of the two different things kind of basic users stick to the wizard it's super simple and the more advanced folks can go with the manual configuration and setup they will all bring you to the end which is that you can start utilizing those bonded connections of multiple internet sources into one internet source we're also going to be covering some light optimization of speed Fusion connect kind of showing you how you can optimize it for Mobile use there are some things you can do to it to make it work better if you're moving around the country and your internet connections change as your locations change today I'll be referencing a how-to article that may have additional information on the steps that we talk about that article is available to the public beyond that article we have an extensive array of Articles and webinars and pre-recorded content as well as written content available to our members through our partnership with the mobile internet Resource Center if you start to really want to customize how your traffic operates perform certain automations on how things work set up secondary networks possibly if you have an integration with like a home automation system or other stuff like that we have webinars on all of those topics for for our members so make sure if you kind of get through this and you want to learn more that you check out our memberships at membership.mobilemustave.com before we get into how to set it up I want to talk a little bit about the technology of speed Fusion connect now the back end technology of what's occurring is a term or a technology called sd-wan and it's the ability to take individual internet connections and combine them into a single internet connection very similar to like VPN you've probably heard of that virtual private networking sd-wan creates a tunnel or a connection to a secondary location and that tunnel allows the routers through proprietary technology to combine those multiple internet connections in that tunnel when you utilize speed Fusion connect you're renting the second side of that tunnel from peplink from a data center now devices that you purchase new will come with speed Fusion connect with one terabyte of data included in the device and if you're using it for Zoom calls and you're just using it for work related activities one terabyte will typically last you six months to possibly a year if you do run out of storage space you can pick up another one terabyte of speed Fusion connect data for forty dollars and it's good for as long as you need it so that is a very good deal that being said you don't want to use up your one terabyte of data watching Netflix for example you'll chew through a ton of data very quickly and it's not really going to make Netflix work any better in fact vpns like speed Fusion connect can actually cause problems with streaming services like Netflix because they think you're trying to watch that show from a different location the reason for that is because that tunnel that we talked about is enabled so it looks like your traffic's coming from peplink not from your actual location that's all okay this configuration it will allow you to use speed Fusion connect or not simply by connecting two different Wi-Fi networks today we're going to configure a non-speed fusion Wi-Fi network that'll be kind of your primary normal Wi-Fi and then we'll configure another Wi-Fi network that we're going to name something different to and if you're inside your RV you simply connect the devices that you need speed Fusion connect to to the right Wi-Fi network to get the benefits of the technology I'll go ahead and Link in the video description a link to the wiring diagram for the setup in this RV it's probably a bit more complicated than your setup well most likely just because we have a lot of different accessories plugged in but it will give you a basic understanding of how everything is wired together all right so now we're going to hop over to my desktop computer and we're going to get started with configuring speed Fusion connect let's go all right everyone welcome to my desktop here so what we've got here essentially is a bone stock peplink MAX Transit Pro so this is a dual modem dual cellular capable device that is popular in our ultimate Road Warrior bundles very similar to The Road Warrior any any of the Warrior series that have multiple modems but if you're looking at a 5G or something else that is fine as long as you have the capability to have more than one connection enabled at the same time we'll get into that in a minute so before we start I want to just link and reference back to our quick start guide and our Wi-Fi setup best practices guides those are kind of two fundamental guides that we recommend folks follow to do the Baseline configuration of your device things like customizing your Wi-Fi networks and other things it's a good idea to do those things first so we're going to be operating today off of a bone stock device so you'll see some default names like this wi-fi network here and those would be customized or changed to what your preferences are assuming you've set up those devices we'll link the Wi-Fi setup and the just quick start guide in the video description just so you have access to those as a prerequisite to getting started with this video the next thing we want to do is I've recommend that before you do anything like messing around with speed Fusion connect is go ahead and go over to the system tab click on the configuration and download your active configurations that's going to download a file as you can see here which is going to save a copy of all of your settings before you start messing with the settings now if you get stuck if something doesn't work if you're confused anything happens all you need to do is go back to system configuration and click upload configuration select that file from where you downloaded here in this case of my downloads folder and hit the upload button and it will upload all of your previous settings and restart the device to get you back where you started so it's a good thing to do both before you start on this journey and after if you get everything working just the way you want download those configurations again because chances are in a month or two or three or four of the Internet working great if something did happen to your device ice and you had to have it replaced under warranty or something else having that file means you can restore all those settings without having to do all of this setup again so just keep that in mind before we get started next I want to talk to you guys about the dashboard so we're talking today about speed Fusion connect speed Fusion Cloud speed Fusion protect whatever they want to call it we're talking about connecting multiple connections together into one unified connection via speed Fusion to provide redundancy on your internet connection now speed Fusion connect is only going to use connections that are in Priority One or enabled so if you see green boxes next to them that will mean that they are enabled and that they would be used by default with speed Fusion if you have anything in priority 2 that will not be used unless the priority One connections all go offline so just keep that in mind that is a question that comes up a bit and these can be dragged and dropped via the handles on the sides here to enable each connection that you want for us today we've got starlink cellular one and cellular2 all in the enabled and then we have Wi-Fi as Wan a connection to we'll kind of assume that's like Campground Wi-Fi that is sitting in standby only to be used if all of these connections fail okay great so now we're going to click on the speed Fusion connect tab up here and we're going to click on choose Cloud location we're going to go down here and we're going to click automatic and this is going to select the closest data center to my physical location as you can see down here there's quite a few in the United States in different locations automatic will automatically update to the closest location if you're more comfortable selecting a specific location that's okay as well but for this video we're going to go ahead and click automatic because we're focusing on the easy wizard on how to get everything up and running next we're going to click on the save button and we're going to click on the apply changes and confirm button up here and we're going to wait a little bit probably about 30 seconds or so and we're going to go back to the dashboard Tab and as we wait we're going to see things start to pop up here on this dashboard as the device here it is sfc for Speed Fusion connect starts to populate and configure the speed Fusion tunnel and there we go we are established now we have a tunnel two-speed Fusion connected with that simple but we're not going to utilize that tunnel yet unless we do some additional configuration so let's go ahead and do that now as I mentioned before we were going to create a second Wi-Fi or wireless network inside of our setup that is going to be for the speed Fusion connect bonded tunnel I'm going to go back to the speed Fusion connect tab I'm going to click on link Wi-Fi to Cloud I'm going to look at my drop down and pick the wireless network that already exists it's basically going to mimic the settings of this so things like your Wi-Fi password and all the other settings will be cloned from this drop down so pick the one that you want to clone for Speed Fusion connect in this case I only have one wireless network because it's a default device so that's the one I'm going to pick now under the name here if I click save this would become my name peplink underscore blah blah blah parentheses automatic and what I want to have this uh set up to is something that is named something that I'll remember as speed Fusion so I'm going to call this peplink underscore B4 CD just so it's the same and then I'm going to hit space and type in sfc for Speed Fusion connect and I'm going to go ahead and hit save now again if this was your network this would say for example the Smith family and then this would say the Smith family sfc um we're just working with the default device so that's why these names are the defaults all right I've gone ahead and hit apply changes I'm going to go back to that dashboard and we're going to wait another 30 seconds or so and I'm just going to go ahead and refresh my dashboard and boom there we go peplic underscored sfc and as you can see here there's a little picture of a cloud next to this wi-fi and what that tells me is that any device that's connected to this will utilize the speed Fusion connect functionality and it will bond these connections by default so if I'm on a zoom call or something else this is the Wi-Fi network I'm going to connect to that is how simple it is to to configure speed Fusion Connect using the wizard now that we're done with the basics of the wizard here we're going to go and optimize the speed Fusion connect tunnel for cellular and kind of Mobility traffic I'm going to click over here on speed Fusion connect I'm going to go to choose a cloud location again here is my existing tunnel here I'm going to click on the name sfc here which will bring up my settings tab I'm going to scroll down here and under policy I'm going to collect Dynamic weighted bonding and what this essentially does is it optimizes the speed Fusion connect tunnel to understand that the connections to the internet may be different some may be faster some may be slower there is a detailed description of kind of the differences in these algorithms but the short answer is the dynamic weighted bonding is optimized for connections like Cellular Connections or starlink connections so we want to select that to get the best possible performance for the most part all of the setting things in addition to this can be left as default we do cover in Our member area a bit more of some of these settings and what they mean and what they do if you are interested in learning about each of these but will not cover that in our basic tutorial today all right so we've gone ahead and saved that and we're going to click apply changes all right so that's it that's how you configure speed Fusion Connect using the wizard and if you're going to be connecting to speed Fusion connect via Wi-Fi that's really all you need to do it's pretty simple now what we're going to do now is we're going to go through the advanced configuration and that's going to be useful for folks like I said before who want to connect wired devices who or who want to like tweak their connections a bit more the first couple steps I'm going to do is going to undo some of the wizard settings just so that we can start with the manual configuration and make sure nothing overlaps just a few clicks here and there but follow along with the video and we'll get you started with the more advanced configuration of speed Fusion connect next let's go all right so let's move on to a more advanced configuration that would support connecting wired devices and giving you a bit more flexibility all right so we I have everything exactly where we left off in the Wizard setup but we are going to make a couple changes because we're going to set things up outside of the wizard first I'm going to hop over to speed Fusion connect under optimize Cloud application so I'm going to go ahead and remove any applications that were set there just so that I've gone back to the default and I'm going to go into the link to Wi-Fi and I'm going to remove that Wi-Fi network that we set up for Speed Fusion cloud and I'm going ahead and actually I'm going to skip hitting apply changes just for now because we can do a few other things the first thing we're going to do is we're going to create a new network under the networking tab this is also known as a VLAN and this network is going to be where all of our speed Fusion traffic sits whether or not it's wired or Wireless so the default IP address for these devices is 192.168.50.1 but because we're creating a new network I'm going to move this to 51 and this is going to now be called speed Fusion connect Network next I'm going to give that a VLAN ID that's a more advanced feature but for this tutorial you can go ahead and just click two or any unique number other than zero you don't want that you don't want to be blank so 2 is fine we're going to enable intervlan routing by default we're going to leave everything else here default and we're going to enter in a range of IP addresses that the router will give out to anybody who hops on this network uh if you don't know what any of this means that's okay you can just honestly copy exactly what I'm putting in here and everything will work fine for you everything else is going to be left as default and we're going to go ahead and save that now we've got our new speed Fusion connect Network that has been created now this network has been created but we haven't told the device to put any clients on this network yet so it is effectively not being used at all right now so that's what we're going to do next we're going to go ahead and go to the AP tab we're going to create a new Wi-Fi network we're going to call it let me go copy the name of this we're basically going to mimic what we did in the Wizard but we're just doing it manually I'm going to go ahead and do that and then I'm going to type in sfc at the end for Speed Fusion Cloud but now I'm going to select the speed Fusion connect Network as the VLAN that this wi-fi network will use under security policy I'm going to go ahead and click WPA2 personal you could also do wpa3 or any of these other ones my only recommendation is do not select WPA WPA2 this one down here as this will flag a security warning on most iOS devices saying that the Wi-Fi is insecure so WPA2 personal is kind of a good blend of Maximum compatibility and good security as of 2022. I'm going to type in the Wi-Fi password that of my choosing here this would be the password you would use to connect to the network we're just going to say welcome 2022 exclamation point please pick a better password than that but for this tutorial that will work for us and everything else will remain as defaults down to the bottom click save and now we're going to hit that apply changes button because we've made a bunch of changes at this point okay so now we've got a Wi-Fi network set up for Speed Fusion connect we've got a network setup for Speed Fusion connect so it should just work right well not not quite yet we still got one more component to do which is we've got to go to the advanced Tab and we've got to tell the firewall where we want the traffic to Route out for that new network we created so we're going to go to Advanced outbound policy we're going to add a rule and we're going to call this sfc for Speed Fusion connect outbound policy there we go we're going to enable that and the source is going to be an ipnetwork and we're going to select the network that we just created which is the 51 .1 Network the subnet mask for those networks will be the default which as you see here which is a slash 24 Network and the destination is going to be anywhere we don't really care where you go out on the internet if you've connected to this new network we created we want it to use the connection that we're going to tell it we prefer since this is a speed Fusion outbound policy protocols we're going to leave as any sorry and then we're going to go here and we're going to set a Priority Access algorithm for how it's going to connect and we're going to drag right in here the not in use and we see cloud sfc and we're going to make that our highest priority connection now if you want to just make 100 sure you're always using speed Fusion connect you can drag these other ones to not in use and it will always use speed Fusion connect or if you want you can just leave them in secondary priority like you see here and the only time it will drop and use these Connections in the order you see them here is if for some reason this tunnel cannot connect like if there was a server down at speed at a peplink or something like that we've never seen that happen but it is worth mentioning so these will occur in the order uh we can leave the other options here as defaults uh we cover what these do and what they mean in Our member area in our webinars where we talk about this in Greater detail but for the vast majority of customers you can just leave that as default we're going to go ahead and click save and apply changes okay so now anyone who connects to this peplink network here via the Wi-Fi they are going to use the speed Fusion connect tunnel that is established down here and showing in green so We're Off to the Races obviously that was a lot more steps to accomplish what basically the wizard was able to do in fewer steps but there's there's more that you can do now that you've set this up manually the first thing I want to show folks is we did talk about the fact that you could now have wired devices show up on the speed Fusion tunnel the way you would do that is go over to port settings now this is a Transit so it only has one Lan Port here uh you could reconfigure the WAN port to act like a lan Port but because I'm using it first for uh starlink I have one Lan Port here listed so if I wanted all wired devices to use the speed Fusion connect tunnel I would just go over here Network port settings and I'm going to go ahead and move this to access and then I'm going to move the speed the VLAN over to speed Fusion connect and then I would hit save and any wired device that connected via an ethernet cable to that port on the firewall would now utilize the new network the speed Fusion connect Network that we set up now if you want to check where your devices are connected you can go to the status tab click on Client List and it will show you your devices and it'll show you what network 50 or 51 in our case each device is connected to so you can troubleshoot and verify that the connection is working you can also click here on the speed Fusion Tab and inside here you can see which connections are enabled looks like my starlink connection has a link failure right now because we're in a bit of a rainstorm and it's not connected but my secondary connections are working fine and it looks like my Wi-Fi Wan is still good and in standby but not enabled there's some additional information that you can look at if you go ahead and click this chart that'll give you some chart based information or you can click this drop down and it will actually show you additional information about the speed Fusion tunnel what's going on traffic up and down live so you can really understand how everything is operating all right so that concludes the more advanced configuration of speed Fusion connect and how you get things going not using the wizard if you're interested in a more advanced configuration let's hop out of my desktop and we'll wrap things up all right so that covers the basics you've gotten yourself set up with speed Fusion connect either using that basic Wizard or going with the more advanced configuration that gives you a little bit more in terms of options as well as the ability to hook up wired devices now there is a lot more to this topic as I mentioned earlier in the video some customers are like I don't care what Wi-Fi network I'm on I want this computer to always connect to speed Fusion you can do that there's a way to do that with something called a MAC address some customers have integrated secondary networks for security cameras or maybe they have a touch screen that controls their lights in their RV and they want to know how to integrate a secondary Network into this configuration you can do that as well we've at the point of this filming I think we've we've got 10 plus extensive long

{"id": "YtB4leHzfrM", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "WAVCLRK18348EYnUWKm9-EA6tTI", "transcript": "hi guys this is Andy from mobile must have in this video something new that is revolutionary to portable water filtration we and mobile must have been working on this for over a year going back and forth with the manufacturer and it's finally ready to show everybody when we say this is a game changer we mean this is a better filter it is easier to use it is smaller and overall it's cheaper than anything else like it on the market come along with me and I'll tell you all about it now before we dive into anything let's talk about credibility blue Technologies and their parent company have over 200 employees in Michigan their patented technology is a Fast Company world changing idea of 2021 they have also been named the RV business rise Award of the same year now Corbin and his team at Blue technology reached out to mobile must have over 18 months ago and we've been providing feedback ever since to their engineering team on this new product now the result is a groundbreaking water filtration system that is not only a world-class water filter itself it solves a lot of the day-to-day problems we have as rvers with bad hoses poor connections and just general issues and challenges when setting up and tearing down Camp before we get into this we've got to talk about filters filters is where the magic happens now with filters there's always been a conundrum you either can get fast flow rate with kind of a low end filter or if you want a better filter you typically sacrifice flow rate now to get around this issue a lot of companies have just gone with bigger filters bigger filter you have more square inches to put water through and you can have a higher flow rate but blue technology with their patented 0.2 filter to solve that problem and you can still get a high flow rate with extreme portability now this all sounds too good to be true and I I hear you when you say that that is why Eric and I have spent over a year testing this on our own RVs ourselves and we are happy to stand here and say this is the game changer we say it is now without getting too technical water filtration is typically measured in microns if you have one of these kind of more standard um Amazon Camco RV filters these are going to typically filter at 20 microns this one says it specifically and these are 20 microns will typically get out sand and large dirt particles and that's about it it's pretty good for filtering out thousands of gallons if you're just trying to pull a little bit of sand out but that's typically where these cap out now these filters are going to be a 0.2 Micron Technology that is 0.2 Micron a hundred times better than 20 microns and that is going to pull out a ton of stuff protecting you from organic compounds hazardous materials including lead CIS E coli gerardia all kinds of different things and even more now the filters in this system use a 0.2 micron filter technology again that is 0.2 that is a hundred times better than a 20 micron filter and that means you're protecting yourself from a lot more in your water this is going to be pulling things out that's organic materials hazardous materials including lead cysts E coli and Giardia Arsenic and even more it is one of the best filters you can get the blue off-grid filter solution is also certified NSF and ANSI 42 and 60 C1 standards now a step up from the 20 micron filter is a 5 micron filter a lot of competitors will start with a 5 micron filter and that's definitely better than 20. but you're still letting a lot of nasty stuff through viruses and bacteria can still get through a five micron filter and that's why you really need a 0.2 micron filter from Optimum water safety and that's what data is showing as of the date of this video now there are some competitors that do have a 0.2 micron filter but Blues technology makes it smaller you still have that high flow rate it's cheaper and overall it's easy to use and I can say that with confidence after using it in my RV for over a year we are that confident with this new solution [Music] foreign this is a product launch video we're going to try and keep it pretty high level today there will be more videos on every single solution and parts you see here in listing pages and follow And subscribe if you'd like to see more about our water safety options but this is a system I use for my family of five it contains a three-stage water filter system with the MR3 I then connect it to the 16 Grain water softener and then all of this connects together with the r connect system everything with blue Technologies is modular you can start with just the filter you can add just the water softener if you wanted or any combination everything uses R connect which makes it extremely easy to connect together and a very quick process when you get to your campsite and you're ready to set up now to show you the true benefits of the r connect system I wanted to just put this back on my RV and show you how fast that can be done okay all I've done at this point is basically set everything on the ground and let's show connecting it so I've already connected my hose to the spigot I can do a quick connect here to connect that I take one of my aux hoses I'm going to connect that to the filter and then right into the softener done then I'm going to go softener softener sides connected open up My Water Bay I already have the other end of the Quick Connect basically in my in intake connect that in there and we're done now we just have to turn on the water now that setup couldn't be simpler and these are connects are absolutely one of my favorite things as an rver now the r connects themselves are made out of 304 stainless steel as is the filter housings the hoses and just about everything that touches the water minus the filter themselves 304 stainless steel is typically used in a lot of high-end residential and commercial water uses it's perfect for this because of its high resistance to corrosion and low nickel content making it the perfect material to use for any drinking water application now this art connect system uses high quality materials and heavy duty components to make sure there's no leaks for years to come it also is seamless with a lot of accessories this is going to be your high flow pressure regulator valve they also have just pressure gauges spray nozzles hose extensions Splitters you name it they got it and all works seamlessly with the r connect system now let's talk about filtration this is what the system is all about our connects are super great it makes it really easy to use but we've got to know that these filters are safe so this is going to be the MR3 we will use as an example in a three-stage filter the first filter is going to be your sediment filter it's going to be kind of a high micron filter that's just designed to take out sand large particles and extend the life of the following filters now the second stage is all about taste this is a 5 micron filter that is a coconut shell charcoal based filter all for taste and smell it is going to pull out chlorine so your water tastes better and overall smells better now the last stage is your safety filter this is going to catch everything that the first two filters missed and that is why you need that 0.2 Micron level filtration to pull out your viruses your bacteria your Giardia your E coli all of that is coming out and being caught up in that filter now when we look at changing the filters we no longer need kind of these big filter wrenches that you have to keep on hand and find and remember where you stored it these are going to use a simple little key and really even if you don't have this you can use any sort of screwdriver you can quickly turn basically the locking mechanism of the stainless steel housing and then change your filter oh and by the way the filter housings like we mentioned earlier are that 304 stainless steel they are dishwasher safe you can wash them inside with all your dishes so every filter change we do that to make sure there's nothing extra grimy or gross in there and we have perfectly clean filter housings when we change our filters now for me with this system we are changing these filters out about every six months they are rated for about 5 000 gallons in the three stage system they're rated for about three thousand gallons in a two-stage system it's just because there's only two filters so each filter is doing a little bit more work now for my family uh 5 we go through that about every six months we're trying to get better on that but it kind of depends on how often you use the water and more importantly how dirty the water is coming in if you have a really heavy silt filled water kind of coming into the system it's going to clog the filters up faster than if you're on a relatively clean city-like Source like we have here so as you can see these filters are small massively effective high flow and they're cheap this is what we talk about when we say game changer for the portable RV water filter system let's talk quickly about the water softener from Blue Tech water softener is a 16 000 Grain water softener it's designed out of a stainless steel 304 housing it is lighter and stronger than a lot of the competitive units that are still using fiberglass a water softener is using the same technology that we see in a lot of other water softeners it's going to use an ion exchange which is going to pull out the calcium and magnesium in the water which gives your water a softer feel as you're kind of showering and using it for your dishes now what's great about this particular unit is you just need table salt for regeneration this is great because it keeps the cost of ownership very low and it's really easy to get even if you're in remote places now our friends at Blue Tech brought up a very interesting point about some of the competitive units that are still using fiberglass that design of water softener was designed for more residential home-based use and is great when it's in a basement however the concern is is when you bring that kind of design out and you're putting it outside you're putting it in the sun especially some really hot sun like in the Texas Summers all of a sudden you might now have a really heated plastic resin that you are passing your water through now I am not a certified scientist to talk about this at all but we do know that stainless steel is going to be a much more stable material especially when it's heated and cooled by outside remedies then passing something through kind of an overheated resin base that just might not be the best for your water this is the MRX plus the off-grid solution from Blue Tech it uses the same great filter technology but has an integrated pump and power solution to give you water anywhere you could be we're so confident in this solution we'll prove it to you now on level up cheers tastes good bring trusted off-grid technology to your RV for no dirty water so there you have it this is the filter lineup we have at mobile

{"id": "y9tvGYHmJy8", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "rGwNHY9a0aE3gujoWjXzicrl7Q8", "transcript": "hi this is Eric with mobilemusthap.com and today we're here to talk to you about the parsec Belgian Shepherd roof antenna now this is a seven and one roof antenna it's a high performance antenna and it's in a long slender form factor come along with us and we'll tell you all about it [Music] thanks so much for joining us guys so the Belgian Shepherd in this particular format this is the one we typically carry and sell to most of our customers is a seven in one antenna now this has seven cellular elements or cellular antennas built into this housing it has two Wi-Fi antennas for picking up local Wi-Fi and broadcasting local Wi-Fi for your devices or to pick up Campground Wi-Fi Etc and it has a GPS antenna element that makes this a perfect match for our 5G single modem devices our category 20 single modem devices basically our Speed Demon series and it also makes it a very good match for our ultimate Road Warrior series where we have two uh embedded cellular modems Each of which will use two of the four cellular antennas so this is a really good match for just about all of our mid to high-end bundles you could also use this in our entry-level full-timer type bundles as well you just end up with two additional cellular antennas and you'd be future proofing your installation so parsec has a lot of different form factors in terms of what they offer the Belgian Shepherd is known as their top high performance antenna in this long narrow form factor to give you guys an idea of size this is 15 or 14.9 I think inches long about two and a half inches high and width wise almost four inches I think it's 3.8 inches if you hop over to the listing page go to the documentation tab there will be detailed specifications on the unit but that's pretty close to the size of this to give you guys an idea like this is our top uh kind of performance antenna that we see in the RV space that we sell a ton of this is the parsec Husky and this works very well for most of our customers but it is a 10 inch or so um diameter antenna and for certain applications or for Van use or because you're a little bit close on Space because of solar panels or whatnot the Belgian Shepherd can be a alternative form factor that is very close very close to the performance of the Husky um you know you can obviously check in the the detailed specifications but just kind of high level I'd say the Husky is top top performance the Belgian Shepherd would be a close close second in terms of just overall performance and then if you wanted to go even thinner and narrower check out the Australian Shepherd there's a different video for the Australian Shepherd that'll go into that but that kind of gives you an idea of sort of the top form factors there's also one in between this and the Australian called the canine that looks very similar to this it's just lower profile and with that lower profile you're going to gain some benefits at high speeds for police vehicles uh Cruisers and whatnot if you gotta you know really get get up in speed or you want to get below a light bar the canine is very popular but for today's video we're going to talk about the Belgian Shepherd because because of this added size in height um and and just sort of the overall increase in size over the Australian this is really a top perform antenna for receiving those cellular signals the Belgian Shepherd is a true six to six antenna meaning that it goes from 600 megahertz or 617 megahertz up to six gigahertz so it's going to give you support for 5G as well as support for those lower frequencies a 600 megahertz frequencies popular with T-Mobile and their rural band so the uh the Belgian Shepherd is going to get you covered across pretty much everything from a spec perspective if you look at the specifications in this device you will see that some of the gain numbers are actually higher than on the Husky but then you'll see some of the radiated efficiency on the Husky is a little bit better than this so that can be a little confusing for folks this has higher gain numbers does that mean this performs better than the Husky they're really really close they're neck and neck it's hard to tell the difference so we really tell folks to focus on the form factor here if you're trying to make a decision on what the best and antenna is for you we order the Belgian Shepherd in kind of four primary configurations but for special order customers we can order this in just about anything you want there is often times a minimum order quantity if you're you know getting something a bit unique but you can always let us know but the stuff that we typically stock in the Belgian Shepherd is going to be our seven foot cable length and our 15 foot cable length so that you kind of have those options and we also stock it in black and in white so 7 foot 15 black or white any combination of those we carry them in stock we order these antennas with this short bolt configuration here you notice that bolt is very short for RV applications and for the applications our customers use typically the roof structure that you're mounting this to is going to be four or five inches thick and no antenna manufacturer really creates a a bolt that long because of the weight of these cables and because of the weight of this antenna because of this Ultra strong adhesive 3M tape that is pre-installed on the bottom of this antenna you can just disregard this locking nut and this washer during the installation we've got plenty of videos showing you how to do that with various different manufactured antennas they're all the same we've got five plus years of antennas up on roofs that are mounted with just cleaning off that roof removing this bolt sticking down the antenna with that adhesive and then die coring around it and just making sure those antennas have a nice good amount of slack into the RV and that will ensure you don't have any water problems another reason we order with this short bolt configuration that you see here is because that allows this antenna to be compatible with the optional magnet mount kit which you see here there are four magnets here and then there's a hole in the center and this antenna can mount essentially right to that and then the Locking bolt will hold it together and because of that short Bolt on the bottom the cables can twist to the side and come out the side of the magnet Mount this way for a magnet mount installation if that's something of interest to you the Belgian Shepherd also supports the pole mount option as well with that short bolt configuration so if you did want to put this up on a pole you can there might be some better antennas to choose from if you're looking at a pull mount application I tend to look at the um the parsec Akita which is an omnidirectional pull mouth cellular antenna that's ultra high performance but if you're looking for something in this configuration or maybe you're going to have it magnet Mount and then you want to switch it to pull or whatnot the Belgian Shepherd could be an excellent fit for you the Belgian Shepherd like other high performance parsec antennas comes with that LSR 200 high performance cable pre-installed on the unit again if you can always go with a shorter length antenna wire we we recommend that you get that seven foot if you can but the 15 will get you pretty solid performance as well if you can though don't go above 15 feet just because you're going to lose a lot of the performance and the gain of the antenna by adding extra cable because that cable creates a lot of loss the Belgian Shepherd is technically what we'd consider a ground plane optional antenna it will perform and work without a ground plane if you don't know what a ground plane is scroll down in the listing page and there's a section on ground planes but keeping it kind of simple for a minute it's a sheet of metal you know conductive metal typically aluminum or steel that's mounted below the antenna and basically it helps when radio waves are coming across horizontally across the Earth it helps them bounce into the antenna it's a little more complicated than that but that's that's basically what a ground plane is it's a plane below the antenna that helps the antenna performance wise we sell a number of different ground planes um but one that is most popular is a 16 inch round ground plane but because this antenna is 15 inches long you're just not getting a lot of ground plane coverage on these higher areas so we do recommend you take a look at the parsec ground plane this is a new for 2022 product that is super cool you're like there's a ground plane in there I know there's a separate video for this that you can check out but at a high level this is a 20 inch by 20 inch adhesive ground plane and it this is capable of working in outdoor installation applications essentially you can clean the roof go ahead and roll this out there's an ultra Ultra sticky weather resistant 3M style adhesive here on the back and then you can cut this to any size necessary if you've got a unique mounting installation or you can just leave it 20 by 20 if you want to maximize the performance of this antenna again ground plane optional it will work with without it but if you can add a ground plane if you're installing this in a non-metal roof application this will help improve the performance for a detailed list of specifications on

{"id": "JHpkWIOoVZM", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "FITPYmYSFEuEOiyEV7D9zI0CH1M", "transcript": "hi guys Eric from mobilemustave.com here and today we've got a really interesting and exciting addition to the peplink max Transit series which is our heat sink which is exclusive to mobile must have come along with us and we'll tell you all about it [Music] all right thanks so much for joining us guys and apologies I don't have a pep wave Transit series router with me today that doesn't already have the heatsink on it for the most part like everything at mobile must have we like to test things and this actually has been in testing for over three honestly five months right now uh in my personal setup testing out how this performs which is why it's already in its installed configuration but let's just assume that we're talking about the MAX Transit device here without the heatsink on it when we start this discussion so for the most part people assume heat is bad for electronics and that's very much normally the case heat is not uh typically good and when you touch an electronic device and it's hot to the touch that can kind of give you an indicator that maybe something's wrong and it's a very common uh complaint or just observation we get from customers in The MAX Transit series we're going to kind of explain to you why that's not necessarily a bad thing now we can't go into like detailed specifications because that's all patented information but we'll give you kind of a high level here and that there is a a PCB board or a primary kind of circuit board that is inside of the case of of the transit and it is suspended on these sides here in channels in this hardened aluminum case and this aluminum case does a really good job of conducting heat and pulling it away from the components inside of this device that make a lot of heat typically you'll see a lot of heat coming out of the modem modules that are that are responsible for communicating with the cell towers because they've got to actually output power for uploading and receive signal and you'll also see a lot of heat coming off of the processors that are doing all of the routing or the movement of the packets and information in the firewall they produce a lot of heat peplink was very interested in this Transit series device in making that it very small but also making sure that it's solid state meaning that there's no moving parts inside of it moving Parts like fans can fail and when they fail if the device was designed to work with the fan the device can then overheat and it can fail and because these devices are designed for police ambulance fire commercial Transit use and other really high availability uses they don't want moving Parts in these devices they want them to work with the fewest amount of components that can fail alright so back to those rails that we talked about holding that PCB or kind of that main circuit board inside of this device now inside of this device the rails and all of those chips are basically suspended in midair across the side and across the bottom then peplink creates a a situation at the top here where they adhere the the PCB board and the components that are creating the most amount of heat to a heat sink that dissipates heat and then that connects to the case itself turning the entire case of the device into a heat sink so what that means essentially is that the device itself feels very hot to the touch because it's venting or pushing all of that heat from the PCB boards to the external case of the device which allows it to then vent off into the air keeping the components inside the device cool the net effect of that is that the device can run at a high temperature it's warm to the touch oftentimes we tell people we're like can you touch the device though yeah well is it you know burning you or you're pulling your hand away no it's just very warm okay then you're fine if you find yourself in a situation where you're touching it and it's like hot to the touch check your environmental settings you may just have a situation where you don't have enough ventilation these can run very hot but in a situation where it's too hot to the touch you may want to look at something like this and also make sure that if you're in a cool environment and it's still too hot to the touch contact us because you may have an RMA situation where there's something going on with the device but for the most part if it's warm and yeah it's warm but you can keep your hand there you're perfectly fine so then why do you need a heat sink well you don't that's the short answer but a lot of our customers are interested in making sure that the device runs as cool as possible and it's certainly not going to be something that hurts the device by improving its cooling ability and allowing it to vent that heat more efficiently if you're in a situation where you may have this installed in a cabinet or an upper area or somewhere where it's just getting a bit warmer or if you just want it to run more efficiently or if you're putting a lot of stress on the device by running a ton of devices and really pushing it hard and doing a lot of uploading and downloading and you want to just run the device a bit cooler which can potentially extend the devices life then a heat sink might be a really low cost option for you to add to your mobile router okay so what have we created or come up with here so we have an anodized aluminum heat sink here and you can kind of see through all those ridges that that what we've done here is basically by creating this anodized aluminum heatsink that's the exact pretty much the exact size of the transit series line we've Inc vastly increased the amount of surface area each one of these little fins or vents is pointing up and there's ridges this way and all of those surface areas allow the heat to dissipate more efficiently just like you know if you have crushed ice in a glass versus Cube dice you notice the crushed ice can get the water much colder faster that's because of surface area and heat sinks work very similarly on the back of the heatsink we've installed some thermal conductive tape and this is double-sided tape that's specifically designed to conduct heat and transfer it from the device to the heat sink as mentioned before I've already installed one here so I can't really show you a demonstration of how to install it but it's pretty simple this is a double-sided sticker I typically use a razor blade but you can use just about anything to remove this blue tape that's on top of the thermal tape just going to go ahead and try to peel back that corner for everyone to see and that will expose the white thermal tape that is below that and that's ready to stick directly onto your device so go ahead and you can kind of position it just like you see here centered it doesn't have to be perfect and then go ahead and push that down on the device and then apply pressure down firmly Center down to the device once that heatsink is adhered to the device I'd recommend you just leave it out for you know 15-20 minutes just to let the adhesion Bond properly to the device before installing it in your permanent mounting location we have not had any reports of these falling off as long as folks are properly prepping the top of the device but you know just for good measure let it sit out for a little bit and then it will be good to go stuck on there nice and sturdy thermal tape is removable so you can remove this from the device you'd obviously want to remove this if you were sending the device in for warranty repair you don't want the manufacturer looking at this thing what what is on top of here the this isn't something we manufactured for the device and you can simply pull that off of the device using like a plastic pry tool for you know basically a plastic pry tool you can pick up at just about any big box store I also find that if you if you if you slide them to the side a little bit you can actually dislodge that thermal tape to get the device open if there's any residual adhesive on the device itself that's removable as well that's where those alcohol swabs can come in nice and handy to get that off you could also use just a standard kind of non-aggressive uh removal like a like a 409 anti-grease cleaner or something like that that's not super super strong that won't damage the powder coated paint on the device if you if you have to get the heatsink off but for the most part our customers put them on and then they stay on and they never think about it again in terms of performance if you mount the device down like this with the heatsink up or if you mount it on its side like this with the heatsink off to its side and provide adequate ventilation area above it for the Hot Air Gases to rise and dissipate that's going to be where you're going to provide your best amount of performance this way would be fine as well now just to see how it would perform I actually installed it in my RV up top up in the front cap probably in the worst possible place I could we'll show you a little b-roll here of my installation just to see how this would perform in high heat conditions and it actually did pretty well the heatsink definitely made a big difference in an environment that was pretty warm now I tend to leave that cabinet door open in my previous RV the 2015 Integra that you saw a lot of videos that we did I actually installed a cooling fan in that Center box that vented hot air off into behind the TV that's wide open and that worked really well as well so you can mount this in this upside down configuration like this it will work and improve things a bit but I'd recommend not doing that if you can get it mounted on its side or like this just to maximize the amount of heat dissipation that you'll get when you get a heat sink if you order it from us you'll notice this big stop sticker that says test your setup first before opening this you cannot return heat sinks that have had the thermal tape already ripped off and have been attached to devices like this so get your setup up and running it'll work fine without the heatsink and then once you're really feeling confident about your purchase and you like what you've got you can go ahead and install this or return it if you don't feel like you need it but I'd say if you already picked it up and you've got it and your setup is working go ahead and install it because it's certainly not going to hurt and it will improve the heat dissipation qualities of your peplink pep wave device thank you so much for watching guys if you have any questions please hop over to mobilemustaff.com click in the bottom right hand corner and

{"id": "iJZlECcHZaI", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "xej1gJCIktBU-iBZPP4lW1yta48", "transcript": "peplink's ubr plus a fully redesigned mobile router is here now this little guy's got dual cellular modems which means that it can connect to two cellular networks at the same time they've upgraded this to category seven meaning it has coverage for key bands for a t Verizon and T-Mobile making it a really really interesting choice what's more they've gotten it to a very aggressive price point come along with us and we'll tell you all about it [Music] now as I get this ready and unboxed I want to give you a kind of a sneak peek of what we're going to cover later in this video I'm going to give you a quick overview of speed Fusion connect speed Fusion connect formerly known as speed Fusion cloud is a technology unique to peplink products that allows you to do something called sd-wan bonding or the ability to connect multiple internet sources together into that single unified connection the ubr plus is a dual modem capable device not to be confused with dual SIM a lot of people think that if they pick up a lower end device of a peplink you know manufacturer that it's because it has multiple SIM card slots that means you can use them at the same time that's not always the case if you hop over to mobilemustave.com and you scroll down on the listing page you'll see that they will say single modem device or dual modem device or multiple modem to device depending on the device you're looking at and that will tell you that not only do you have multiple SIM card slots that you can switch between but in certain cases like with the ubr plus you can use multiple connections at the same time in the ubr's case we also have a Wan port or a wired internet port that can also be combined with those Cellular Connections now a Wan Port can be very important for folks that might have an external internet source a lot of our customers utilize starlink and they connect starlink to the ubr plus a lot of our customers also might utilize a cellular data plan for a third connection some folks use the T-Mobile home connection that works great as well and you can connect that up to the WAN port to give you three simultaneous internet connections when you combine it with that embedded cellular modem one and two up until now a dual modem device from paplink has been north of well you know a thousand dollars so a big investment this is a departure from that this represents the first device that's under a thousand dollar price point out of the box that gives you that dual modem capability we'll get into this more in a bit but what's even more impressive is that peplink has also improved the router throughput on this device from some of the previous generations ubrs significantly like seven times faster so this device not only is dual modem but it's got a faster processor and a faster I'm sorry and more memory which makes it capable of providing up to 900 megabits of router throughput that can be very important as these new cellular networks get faster and faster or if you're looking to connect up an external internet source like starlink or something else with that Wan Port moving on to the unboxing of what we see here peplink has updated their their mark their box and their marketing to the to the newer style that kind of was debuted with the br1 pro 5G that's a nice bit of packaging inside of the box here we have four cellular antennas these are two decibel gain cellular antennas uh pretty common with peplink devices to give you guys some backstory though two decibel gain antenna will equal roughly 100 percent gain in cell signal so a lot of our customers most of our customers report that if they put this next to a MiFi Hotspot with no external antennas or their cell phone being operating in a hotspot configuration this will typically show a significant Improvement in sub signals cell signal strength I usually hear them talk about you know at least a bar of improved signal strength and significant Improvement in the actual usability of the internet as a result of those antennas in addition to the four cellular antennas we have two Wi-Fi antennas this unit has Wi-Fi technology so you have the ability to operate this device in 2.4 gigahertz or 5 gigahertz or mixed mode Wi-Fi with Wi-Fi five technology you have the GPS antenna here some branded wire management cable the router itself of course and a AC power adapter with the four pin um micro Molex connector as well as a quick start guide that will primarily tell you how to connect up all the antennas as well as how to get into the administration console peplink is continuing to use this modernized chassis which is great it does a great job of dissipating heat because it has these integrated heat sinks at the top and it's quite slim and easy to mount dimensionally wise obviously if you look at the documentation tab in the listing page you'll see all the specifications but giving you a rough overview on the long side here you're looking at just under seven inches on the shorter side here you're looking at just under six inches probably closer to seven when you add the antennas and then at a height perspective you're looking at about an inch and a little under an inch and a half it's about I think it's 1.4 inches but you can check out that specification tab for the exact numbers giving you a quick overview of what you see here on this side of the device we have an integrated 4 report ethernet switch we're super excited about that those are gigabit Lan ports one two three four that means that we can connect up wired devices to this unit without having to add an external switch some of the previous generation models had one maybe two ports so the ubr has always been something that's kind of known as kind of the the all-in-one the sport utility vehicle and they're keeping up with that by keeping that integrated four port switch we've got our Wan Port here that we covered a little bit before that's our internet in Port and this is an assignable Wan Port meaning we could technically use it as a fifth Lan Port if that was something that you needed to do if you weren't using it for an external internet source we have our standard complement of status lights over here our top light status will be red when the device is booting up or if there's a problem it will be flashing green when it's in its final boot up stage or solid green just about all of the time other than that you've got your cellular one and two lights below that cellular lights will be off if the modem is disabled they will be flashing green if they're trying to connect to the cellular network and they will be solid green if they're connected that gives you a really nice quick overview if you're curious what the status of your internet connections are without having to log into the administration console continuing on we've got our four pin power plug here the lower two ports which are labeled are for your your DC input power and then your upper two ports are available for your ignition sensing or gpio availability which is a feature in this router on the outer most sides of the the this device we've got our Wi-Fi antennas and that's for our local internet or our local Wi-Fi networks not our cellular networks that's the Wi-Fi technology Wi-Fi five technology we talked about earlier and you've got that dual band 2x2 Wi-Fi so that you can support quite a few Wireless clients lastly on this side we have our reset button right here our paper clip reset button that allows you to do a couple things probably the most common thing is to hold it down for 15 plus seconds and it'll fully reset the device if for some reason you need to reset it but you can also Hold It Down For Less time between 5 and 10 seconds and it will reset the admin password on the device if you ever forget it so that is a nice touch there you can check out an article on how all of that works at support.mobile must have.com let's check out the other side on this side of the device we've got our modem one cellular one and two antennas and our modem two cellular one and two antennas so four cellular ports in total and down here we have our GPS antenna that can provide GPS information and data via the in control 2 cloud-based management control interface kind of like LoJack you can track the vehicle that's also very popular for folks that have fleet vehicles or need to do large device tracking we even have some customers that are bloggers that use this data via downloadable files in in control to update their followers on their travel experiences GPS functionality can be disabled completely via in control as well as all cloud-based management functionality if you're interested in not having that feature available I'm going to go ahead and unscrew the dust cover here for the SIM cards there it goes and show you that next we'll give you a close-up here but you've got four SIM card slots the left two are for modem one and the right two are for modem two the newer style devices like this one are using Nano size SIM cards so the smallest possible SIM card available which is nice no more losing SIM cards in big slots which we're very happy about and it utilizes the standard architecture spring-loaded Sim in and out functionality that we can show you a close-up on where Sims are easily inserted and ejected with the push of a button quickly we like to cover how SIM cards operate in these devices your Notch which is kind of the corner of the SIM card will show you right there will always go in first and the metal part of the Sim will always face towards the other SIM slot so if you're using slot a it will the metal will face towards slot B and if you're using slot B the metal will face us towards slot a some people get confused used by that if you push that in and you receive kind of a hard pushback and it's not spring-loaded that SIM card is likely not installed properly so make sure to check your orientation moving on to the modems for a minute the category 7 modem is a big step up from previous generations if you have an integrated cellular technology product in your RV or marine application that came from the factory it may have a category 6 or a category 4 modem in it that's pretty common category 4 is pretty common and what the categories essentially mean is the amount of available channels that you can connect to up to the cell tower channels are commonly known as cell bands or bands they're kind of blocks of frequencies that the cellular carriers own to allow your devices to connect to the cellular networks and a big problem with some of the devices that you see pre-installed in RVs unlike this one is that they don't have access to a lot of the latest technology and bands to allow for the coverage that you see in all those TV commercial is kind of touting these amazing coverage maps the category 7 modem inside of the ubr plus gives you a couple things first it gives you access to band 14 that is previously not available in category 4 or 6 modems band 14 is a T's rural Band It's actually kind of referred to as their first net band that was originally rolled out for First Responders as part of a partnership that they had or a contract that they had with the federal government to give rural access for First Responders now band 14 on ATT can be used by the public according to ATT and we've confirmed this multiple times as have our partners at the mobile internet Resource Center when the First Responders are not using it so band 14 dramatically increases rural coverage for a t if you're interested in learning more about band 14 and firstnet you can hop over the listing page and scroll down to the section that covers firstnet category 7 also gives you access to two key bands for T-Mobile the first one is band 66 that's kind of like a big Workhorse band for T-Mobile it operates in some of the higher spectrums but it's it's where a lot of their network coverage comes from so band 66 is super important again not something that was included in Category 6 devices in addition you're getting access to band 71 band 71 is T-Mobile's rural band and that operates at a lower 600 megahertz frequency allowing it to go very very far with fewer Towers that's how T-Mobile has been able to roll out these expansive coverage maps and kind of become one of the big players in the cello industry in such a short period of time so band 71 is super important as well to learn more about band 71 you can again scroll down on the listing page and we've got a section there labeled band 71. in addition to the bands that it has access to they've also dramatically improve the upload speed of the modems for this device so previous category six I won't even talk about category four but Category 6 had a Max upload speed of 50 megabits per second with category 7 you're increasing that three times to 150 megabits per second and on the download side you get 300 megabits per second of Max download speed per modem so it's quite a fast device talking about router throughput or speed for a minute this device actually borrows its processor from the balance 20x device I'm very happy about that they've kind of brought in a mid-level processor that was faster than previous generation processors and allowed them to keep such an aggressive price point what that means is we have 900 megabits of Max router throughput in that device which is quite a bit in addition if you're going to be using speed Fusion connect or formerly known as speed Fusion Cloud your connection speeds for an unencrypted speed Fusion tunnel will be 100 megabits per second which is quite a bit of speed for sd-wan applications and if you encrypt that traffic you're looking at 60 megabits per second still more than enough for everyone in your RV to enjoy that speed Fusion tunnel uh without you know your kind of average activities for work and play bumping up against those limits I do want to cover on the DC power side that this unit will accept between 12 and 30 volts so it will work in 24 volt DC applications which is very nice and of course mobilemusstaff.com has direct wire fused DC power cables available on the listing page in addition to the included AC adapter the ubr plus also is set to have the AP controller feature added very soon it did not ship with the AP controller just like the br1 pro 5G didn't ship with the AP controller but they released it in a I think it was in about 60 days from release I suspect it's going to be even faster on the ubr plus because they've worked out how to add that feature to routers very easily what the AP controller will do is allow you to add external secondary access points and control them or configure them all from the central Management console of the device that's going to come in super handy if you're interested in adding additional coverage if you want to set up maybe an access point that supports Wi-Fi 6 if that's important to you typically in an RV application Wi-Fi five or six will work just fine for anybody but some people want the latest and greatest so you can add Wi-Fi 6 using I'd recommend the AP1 ax Lite access point that's a great little access point that supports Wi-Fi six it has an extremely powerful radio but the point is you can control that inside of this device using the AP controller but just to note on on day one it's not shipping with that it will come in a future firmer release that is coming very soon all right so I'm going to go ahead and hook this device up with all of its antennas then I'm going to head over to my desk and I'm going to give you guys a quick demonstration of just how easy it is to set up speed Fusion connect and get yourself connected with multiple cellular or any connection internet connection could be Wi-Fi Wan from a campground could be a wired connection to the WAN Port from a starlink like we mentioned before or just about any uh internet connection and combine it with whatever other internet connections you have so in this particular demonstration we're going to show you how to combine a wired internet connection which we're going to plug into the WAN port and a cellular internet connection into this device so that you can see three connections because we're going to use both cellular modems all connected at once since I don't have a plug here I'm going to go ahead and plug this unit in using our optional battery pack and optional DC power connect cable kit that we have here and that is something also available at mobile must have.com and so we are powering up right now that's going to boot up in a second I'm going to hop over to my desk and show you how this all works all right and welcome to my desktop now in summary we are going to be going over how easy it is to set up a speed Fusion connect which is also known as speed Fusion Cloud that is the ability to combine multiple internet sources together into one single connection typically why that's important is if you need a more reliable internet connection having more than one connection available we'll ensure that if one drops out you can still remain connected now before we get started I do want to mention that this is a very high level overview to show you how simple this configuration is but if you go to guides.mobilemosthav.com and you scroll down to the mobile internet guides and look down here for Speed Fusion Cloud there is a detailed guide that gives you a lot more backstory of how the technology Works recommended use cases and a step-by-step guide on how to configure everything we're going to cover these Basics right now as well just for new customers to know that if they are thinking about purchasing a router like the ubr plus just how easy it is to get speed Fusion connect up and running all right so let's get started now to begin you have to access the admin console of the router which is typically at the address 192.168.50.1 at that same guides dot mobile must have.com link you will also see quick start guides or setup guides to get you through all of the basics we're going to assume you have basic understandings of how to get to a router admin console but if you don't go ahead and check out those guides so the first thing we want to do is we're going to drag in the connections that we want speed Fusion connect to use in this case we are going to use the WAN connection which in this case we'll assume is starlink and a Cellular Connection I don't have a second SIM card here with me but if we wanted to we could enable that second cellular modem into the primary connection as well and have three connections if I enable it right now since there's no sim it will simply disregard this third connection as not available any connection that is in green will be used any connection that is in yellow is in standby so that's not going to be used and anything that's in disabled or grayed out will not be used so make sure that if you want it to be used in the speed Fusion connect tunnel that it is showing up as green on the dashboard one other note before we continue you may have seen that this is the pep wave MAX Transit even though this is a ubr video the ubr uh is here and working but unfortunately my team has run away with my SIM cards so I'm using this MAX Transit for this demo these screens are identical it's one of the benefits of Pep wave devices is they all run on the same operating system so once you learn one you've basically learned them all so let's get started all right so we're going to hop up to the speed Fusion connect tab here we're going to click a cloud location and from backstory will be covered in the articles I mentioned earlier but essentially any type of sd-wan bonding or bonding or multiple internet connections will create a VPN tunnel or a secure tunnel to a data center that allows the internet connections to be combined more detail in the guide but for the purpose of speed Fusion connect you're essentially hosting the second side of that tunnel up in the cloud with peplink they host that for you that's part of the technology you can pick the location and typically you want the location of your Cloud Server to be close to you that will improve what's called latency or you know the amount of time it takes for your router to talk to the internet or the data center I'm going to go ahead and select automatic I think it goes does very well and it will automatically select based on the number of different United States locations which one's closest to you and update accordingly that's a good default selection if you're not sure what to do I'm then going to hit the green check box here and I'm going to hit the apply changes button here all right if we go back to the dashboard we will now see that speed Fusion connect is enabling itself and we will start to see speed Fusion tunnels start to appear in this dashboard in just a minute now while those are configuring themselves as we can see here the tunnels are starting up let's go ahead and create a wireless network that will be used by the speed Fusion connect tunnel now the reason I like to create a wireless network that's dedicated to speed Fusion is because I don't typically always want to use speed Fusion for example certain traffic like streaming traffic or other data may be something that I'm I'm not necessarily interested in using speed Fusion 4. that is covered in Greater detail in that article at guides.molandmustaff.com for me I use speed Fusion typically when I'm getting on a zoom call a work call or any other internet activity where I want a reliable connection so I like to have a separate wireless network that I can simply connect to whenever I want to use speed Fusion cloud and they make it very easy so we're going to go ahead and hit link Wi-Fi to Cloud then we are going to pick one of the existing wireless networks that's already in the router in this case this is a default unit so there's only one and I'm going to rename the Wi-Fi to something that I will know is always my speed Fusion cloud SSID so in this case I'm going to actually keep the same name but I'm just going to write sfc after it for Speed Fusion connect or speed Fusion cloud and I'm going to go ahead and hit save and apply changes we go back to the dashboard here and it will be configuring that Wi-Fi network and here's the original Legacy one in in just a minute a secondary one will pop up here and it will have a picture of a cloud next to it with the new name that we just picked and if I hop into my wireless settings on any of my devices after about one or two minutes that new wireless network will appear and anything that connects to it will utilize the speed Fusion Cloud bonded connection that will utilize the multiple internet sources all in Priority One it is that simple when I started in technology setting up this stuff took practically a PhD and now it is that simple it's just a couple clicks to get it up and running that's one of the benefits and beauties of what peplink has put together in the speed Fusion connect technology I'm going to show you one more thing before we wrap up the video and let's go ahead and do that now we're going to go back over to speed Fusion connect and we're going to click on optimize Cloud applications and this is something that I'm going to do for Zoom I use zoom for my day-to-day calls with my team and I'm going to go ahead and hit plus and Save now what this has just done is this has told the router that if it ever sees traffic from Zoom it will route it over the speed Fusion tunnel regardless of what wireless connection that I'm connected to this is a nice default override to create for any applications that are super important for you to make sure you're using speed Fusion connect on there's quite a few default ones that you can see here from OneDrive which is Microsoft and exchange online office 365. really all of the key big workplace applications Skype which is Microsoft teams and this is a nice handy way to make sure that that traffic will always go over the speed Fusion Cloud connection I'm going to go ahead and hit apply changes and then let's hop back over to the dashboard just to confirm everything looks good and voila there's our little picture of our Cloud our second Wi-Fi network it shows our tunnel is established and connected and these connections that are in green will be utilized in this case my connection to ATT and my connection to starlink which is on my Wan Port one last tip before we wrap up to kind of give you an idea of what our member exclusive area gives you access to let's go ahead and go into the speed Fusion connect tab and we're going to go into choose Cloud location I know we've already done this before but I'm going to show you a little trick here to improve your speeds if you have internet connections that are of differing speed I'm going to go ahead and click on the name of our tunnel which is the default speed Fusion Cloud another traffic distribution I'm going to change this to Dynamic weighted bonding I'm going to leave all the other settings default and if you want to understand a summary of the different policies or algorithms that this is using Dynamic weighted bonding is used for is using a different algorithm designed for Cellular Connections or really for just any connections that aren't identical when sd-wan was developed a lot of customers had say two cable modems or two DSL connections things of that nature and as we know as mobile users our connections can dramatically vary in speed and latency depending on our location so by enabling Dynamic weighted bonding in our speed Fusion tunnel we are telling the tunnel that the connection speeds for each Connection in the case of our connections being the WAN port with our starlink and The Cellular Connection with our ATT are different they're not going to be always the same that Dynamic weighted bonding will improve the overall performance and speed typically of the combined connection now that it knows you are using different connections as mentioned we just covered the basics here of speed Fusion connect if you're interested in diving deeper we cover things like custom networks what to do about wired devices not just wireless devices setting up vlans setting up particular priorities outbound traffic all manner of things in our monthly webinars that we do for our members so make sure to check out the memberships at membership.mobilemustaff.com that gets you access to the forums where you can ask questions specific to your device and it gets

{"id": "k5VqPJF1oAg", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "x6GWvKN1119WXg1MhW7hbjgdDzQ", "transcript": "hi this is Eric with mobilemustave.com and today we've got something new and exciting because it will allow you to power a lot of devices including pep wave devices via battery this is our new 30 000 milliamp portable power station come along and we'll tell you all about it [Music] portable power kind of bricks like this have been around for quite a while but there's actually a lot of differences in terms of what they can actually do and that can kind of greatly vary what their costs are and kind of what you see I've been pretty unhappy with some of the more smaller Portable Power Systems that I found out there and have found that even though they have like very large batteries inside inside of them you can find other thirty thousand milliamp batteries they oftentimes just don't charge the devices that I use on a regular basis so we've been working with a manufacturer and they've helped us come up with this little beast which is a thirty thousand milliamp hour battery but this has 65 watts of power output via the USB C Port using the power delivery or PD standard with the USBC Port so that's a lot of power before we get into Power stuff let's just talk about size this is just a a little over six inches I think it's about six and a quarter inches long it's about two inches two and a half inches or two and a quarter inches actually wide and about one and a quarter thick so yeah it's it's pretty packed with lithium cells inside of there but they've kept the size down aesthetically this is all aluminum alloy with a really nice finish here I've been using this battery pack for I want to say about five months this has been one of two different units that I've kept in my bag same exact units but I have two of them just because I wanted to make sure that we had really tight quality control and they have been great looking at it really close this is an iPhone 12. Pro not the Max and you can see that it's a smidge bigger than the phone obviously it's thicker but that can kind of give you an idea I'll give you a close-up here to kind of give you a comparison of what you're looking at from a size perspective if you're a member of our membership Rewards program remember that you get points back as part of that membership technically if you're not a member you

fast so make sure you check out that membership but let's get back to the bathroom in addition to that 65 watt us USBC Port which we'll talk about in a minute we have two uh q c 3.0 Quick Charge 3.0 ports over here and both of these are capable of being utilized at the same time in addition to the USBC Port as well those USB uh Quick Charge ports here can deliver one of them uses QC standard that will go up to 18 watts and the other one will go up to 22 Watts depending on if you're on the Apple or the Android standard but you're going to get the maximum benefit out of both of these ports and again they can operate simultaneously if you're looking at QC ports you typically have to utilize a single dedicated cable that supports QC which will typically be the cable that came with your device if you're looking at a phone so so that works but we also at walmart.com sell squid cables or cables that have multiple ends on them and what that basically means is that this is an optional cable that you can see with the battery pack but we sell these which are great so you get that USB a Port that plugs right into this device here and then on the opposite side we've got two lightning cables for sorry those wrong ones two lightning cables here which are for iOS devices iPhones Etc a USBC Port here and a micro USB as well all on the same cable now with the battery pack like this this has the capability to simultaneously output three amps on these cables at the same time at 5 volt which is kind of called the the sync ability to do multi-output on that single port so that's that's a pretty cool feature now it's not quick charge you can't do any quick charge with a multi-cable like this but it is an option just for you to be aware of I find honestly when I need to Quick Charge I use the dedicated cable but the vast majority of the time like when I'm going to bed or I'm just leaving my device on the side of the table I really just kind of want to plug them all in and not think about it for a while and come back and have them all be charged and that's where this cable really comes in handy going back to the battery for a second it comes with this which is a USB C to USBC cable it's a little over one meter it's almost close to four feet long so it's a nice long cable and this supports 100 watts of power delivery so you can literally take this plug it right into your MacBook Pro power brick and plug the other end right into your MacBook Pro and it will get the full benefit of the power without using the battery so it's nice because you get that extra cable now that being said I've got right here a MacBook Pro 14 inch new for kind of came out in in the last year and this comes with a 65 watt power adapter I'm pretty sure it's 65 Watts it's right around there so this supports a 65 watt output now it's not to say that you couldn't charge up a laptop with a 40 watt power supply as long as it's supported the PD standard power delivery standard but why not have it how output the maximum amount that the laptop can support now this this laptop was completely dead I plugged it in a second ago but we should be able to see that come on in a minute and there there you go it will come on in a second I'll show you how it'll show that the battery is completely exhausted but now it is charging up as a result of that portable power pack so a lot of folks think oh USBC because it comes in cars nowadays that it's all basically the same standard and it's all delivering the same amount of power and unfortunately that's not the case you really want to look for a portable power system that has that PD designation which means that it can step up the voltage and deliver those higher wattages for big devices like laptops you also get this Nifty little screen here on the front it's a digital screen that will tell you the percentage of battery left as well as whether or not it is delivering the power delivery PD output power or not or PD input power from a charging perspective so it gives you a little bit of additional information on that screen and in addition to that there is a power button here to wake up the battery typically it will wake up itself automatically when you plug in a device but if you just want to check the status of the battery without any cables connected you can press that button and it'll wake it up and in certain situations with cables like this if it doesn't necessarily detect the device that button will also wake up those USB ports so what can you do in addition to you know powering up a big device like this which is still charging even though the screen is on is actively working well you could charge like an iPhone 13 this is a 12 but a 13 would charge almost from kind of completely dead to full just about nine times so that's a lot of power delivery from a small power pack and that assumed you never charged it at all moving on to the charging side of things this is where I actually see these devices really fall short most of the time some of them just don't have the power power delivery the high wattage power delivery at all so the USB port is really just a glorified 5 volt delivery system that's all you can really get out of it but the ones that do have higher wattage oftentimes don't have it on the charge input side so this one has a 45 watt max power input that will take to charge these batteries a lot of that has to do with you know safety and making sure that they don't charge the batteries too fast 45 watts is a lot of power to put into a battery pack in such a compact housing but what that means for you is that you'll be able to charge this from kind of stone Dead all the way up to full in just about three hours which is pretty quick considering how much power you can get out of this device for your mobile application use now if you're in a pinch and you don't have you know a 45 watt power delivery to charge this up an example of how you would charge that up by the way would be like using the power brick that came with this laptop you'd plug it your your power brick into this and it would charge it up just like it charges your laptop up you don't have to have one of those big bricks you could also step it down to like one that came with an iPad the newer iPads and even some of the newer phones come with 22 or 25 watt Chargers those will charge that up um in the High Speed Charge capacity as well probably closer to four or five hours with those but you don't have to worry about all that that's the beauty of the USBC power delivery standard if it's a USBC device you can plug it in and it's not going to do any damage and that will allow you to charge this up but if you're in a pinch say you're in a car or something and you just want to top off that battery or you're on an airplane and you've got a regular you know USB cable that goes to USBC that would be like your standard iPad cable works that way um you can go ahead and or our cable the squid cable you can go ahead and plug this into a regular port and then take that USBC Port plug it into that same port and it will charge the device now just keep in mind if you use standard USB like this it's going to be charging that at 5 volts at around three amps so uh it's gonna take a while it's probably going to take 24 hours to charge the battery but it can do it in a pinch if you want to just give yourself a little extra power especially if you're in a car ride or something and you just want to try and top off a few percent of the battery it can be done moving on for a second to the world of Pep link uh let's talk about that for a minute I'll put this away now we've got our we've got a couple different devices here this is an older generation Transit and this is actually a unit that was a prototype unit that didn't see the light of day but it very much resembles the new Transit Pro that's in our ultimate Road Warrior bundle so I can show you that as an example because it has the same power input ports on the front now you've got these USBC ports on the front here and if we plug that in and then we plug that right into the battery and go ahead and take a look we will see in a minute that we'll have our red status light that will soon become green meaning this device is powering up and fully functional powered with this battery pack with the included cables right out of the box so ultimate Road Warrior devices can be powered with this battery right out of the box with no additional accessories interesting fun fact here also you may notice that this little Poe ready light is green instead of red on this prototype device and what that essentially means is that this battery pack is still ordering enough power that it actually was able to enable the power over ethernet ports that came on this device now the ultimate Road Warrior bundle does not come with Poe it's not a feature that was enabled in that router but as routers are released if you see one that has Poe capability and a USBC port on it in the future I'm not aware of anything coming right now but I know that they developed the standard in this prototype for a reason you will likely be able to use it with this battery pack so you can get that power over ethernet output enabled on a device with battery power that's pretty cool so what if you don't have an ultimate Road Warrior and you've got a different peplink device maybe a balanced 20x here or possibly the transit classic that we have or maybe one of the newer Minis that that come in the full-timer bundle don't worry you're covered we have an optional cable pack that is listed in the listing and includes two cables here one of them which I'll show you first will take that USBC output that you saw there and it will convert it to the 2.1 millimeter standard Barrel connector so you get your three foot cable here we're going to plug that into the USBC and then let's pick the balance 20x and we'll plug that in give it a second and we'll have a status light in just a minute we'll show you a close-up of that right now in addition to the balance 20x if you've got one of the kind of Legacy devices the max br1 MK2 very popular in our previous full-timer bundles the transit original anything with that round Barrel connector we'll go ahead and power up with that optional cable kit so you are covered in addition to the USBC to Barrel connector cable that you get with the kit if you go ahead and look at the second cable that comes with our optional cable kit they're both included that will go from the barrel connector to the four pin Molex that is on newer devices so if you're looking at the newer full-timer bundle the br1 mini the new ubr that just was launched that comes in our new road warrior package which is a dual cat 7 modem that's an awesome one that's going to be a video coming very soon uh let's see the uh Transit I'm sorry the br1 pro 5G or cat 20. all of these use this four pin locking um micro Molex connector and the included or the optional cable kit that's included as an option you get both of these will power up any peplink device that has that Port as you can see this one right there is powering up as we speak so in conclusion if you have the ultimate Road Warrior kind of the latest generation the VR 2 then you can go ahead and utilize the included cables with the battery with no additional options if you have one of the other generation devices either with the four pin or the round connector pick up the optional cable kit and that will give you the option of the barrel or the 4 pin all in that single option cable kit thank you guys so much for watching this video if you have any question questions about this product or any product that mobile must have.com you can hop on

connection to that cell tower is one of the single best things you can do to improve your speeds and give yourself the best chance of connectivity the x-pole 24 this big boy here takes it it from a two by two up to a four by four memo configuration so there are four directional cellular antennas inside of this housing the Expo 24 is not small it's about uh 17 and a half inches in height by about 14 and a half inches in width and I'd say about four four and a half inches in thickness as you can see there it so it's a big antenna but if you think about the size of an x-pole two by two uh it's roughly it's a little bit uh smaller than if you had two Expos mounted on an antenna and you get it in this compact housing so uh well compact compared to having two separate antennas so the 4x4 configuration inside of one case makes it a lot easier to move around manage the cables and whatnot and the performance out of this thing is pretty awesome what pointing is done in this antenna is they've really optimized this antenna to perform exceptionally well in the United States and globally they've brought in that 600 megahertz support so we're seeing very strong performance uh in T-Mobile's rural band band 71 but we're also seeing very very strong performance in the 5G bands as well they've done a lot here in that wide band area to really improve the effectiveness of this antenna even though it's in such a compact housing the x-poles have really always kind of amazed Us in how effective they are directionally at picking up signal this antenna is uh specified as an 11 decibel Max gain antenna uh quite frankly we've seen it outperform that in some initial testing just around the warehouse where we've kind of you know find some further off distant cellular antennas uh that we couldn't even really necessarily see signal very well at all to cost usable data when we locked onto a particular band and this thing is just a beast but again it is a directional antenna this is not an omnidirectional antenna so you do have to point this at your location pointing antennas no pun intended from the name can cause some problems for customers that have multi-modem Solutions so if you've got like a Transit Pro with two cellular modems in it each one needing to sell antennas you could technically use something like this for both of your modems however if you're using two different cellular providers your cell towers might be in different directions and since this has to be pointed that could cause some problems so you may want to look at an omnidirectional or roof mounted antenna that's also omnidirectional antenna if directional is not for you but for top performance rural home agriculture fixed building Mount stuff directions kind of where it's at because once you dial in where you need to go you don't have to point it again and it just functions perfectly that's where this antenna really shines that 4x4 configuration means that this pairs really well with 5G devices and category 20 or category 18 devices those devices that have four cellular antennas on the back so that would be like our Transit Pro 5G our Transit Pro category 20 say a balance 20x that has the 5G or cat 18 or cat 20 modules installed in and is an optional module modems that are in the those categories are going to do really well with that 4x4 technology that's going to let you take advantage of those newer faster cellular Technologies carrier aggregation Etc pointing has included their LMR or kind of I don't know if it's LMR but it's 195 series shielded antenna cable that they Source it's been a pretty good cable for us it's not necessarily as efficient as some of the 200 plus cables or 220 cables we see in some of the other manufacturers but it has done pretty well for us and they come with 15 feet of cable or five meters dogs in the warehouse say hi in addition to the antenna here you've got a really cool Mount here which we're going to talk about next included in the bundle so on the back here you've got these four screws metric I believe those are M6 screws everything's included that you need to mount but they include this awesome Mount here here that just gives you a ton of flexibility you've got a full articulating 45 degree tilt in this primary joint that would Mount right onto the antenna right there or in that configuration depending on what you need and then on this side you've got the same articulating option here so from a pole mount application here you'd be able to not only tilt this antenna side to side in this direction but also in this other axis as well to make sure you're optimally pointed exactly where you need to be really really strong ABS plastic here and in this mount it just it just feels like really strong good quality with a tremendous amount of flexibility here for pull mount applications we have tested this unit that's backwards we have tested this unit with our carbon telescoping or our fiberglass I should say carbon's the color telescoping antenna and it is able to withhold that as long as you're not in too strong a wind condition so you can go ahead and mount that um to our Pole or the weboost uh telescoping 25 foot aluminum pole uh will work as well in addition you've got um some mollies here for a wall mount application this can mount directly to a building if you don't want to do a pole mount installation so the mollies for that are included or you've got your kind of standard u-clamps here to get that mounted around a pole big thank you to the folks at pointing for getting us a couple demo units so that we could really test these out and we're quite happy with the performance of this antenna specifically around it really kind of closing up some of the concerns we had around performance in certain bands that were lacking in some of the previous pointing antennas so if you're looking for a directional antenna in a nice compact housing That's ip68 rated I believe so super waterproof just the connectors everything on this antenna are super well built at a very nice price point I recommend you check out that pointing x-pole 24. if you're thinking about purchasing this

and Marine kind of low end internet solutions that a lot of customers have been kind of fighting with since they got their setup come along with us and we're going to tell you all about it this thing's awesome [Music] all right so while I get this out of the box I'll kind of give you a summary of some of the challenges that we've seen our 2021 Integra motor coach came with a a wineguard connect 2.0 system um that uh it's I wouldn't call it a bad system it just wasn't providing reliable internet and certainly wasn't uh something that had a very capable cellular modem in it category 4 modem that you know had one of the primary bands for each carrier maybe two that was about it so really low end from a speed and connectivity perspective but you know that's really common in the OEM space you know the manufacturers are trying to get a lot of features packed into that RV at an economical price and not everybody needs the high-end stuff so I get it but for me and for my travels that was definitely something that I was looking to replace now the wineguard unit minutes that I specifically mentioned the connect 2.0 and also the Wi-Fi Ranger units have an ethernet cable up to the roof that's already pre-wired basically you know a Cat5e maybe it's a Cat6 doesn't really matter for these types of applications but it's your standard ethernet cable that's running up to the roof and outside and this new product allows you to utilize that existing wire that's going to be really useful for a lot of folks that don't want to drill new holes in their roof if you're looking at a large purchase like this for mobile internet or for anything at mobilemustave.com make sure you check out our mobile must have Insider program that gives you exclusive discounts to Hardware like this

plans all that stuff it's all included in that membership so make sure you check that out at membership.mobilemosthav.com where there's a whole list of benefits so now that we've got everything unpacked I know we cover a lot of different things on this channel because honestly peplink makes different products for just about every single use case I want to kind of dial this down and explain really who this is best used for and why now the peplink Dome Series has been around for a while and it's it's claim to fame here kind of what makes it really unique is that the cellular router and the antennas are integrated into this Dome here and by having very short cables from the modem up to the antennas here you're going to have better signal performance typically because you don't have loss in that long cable that also means that coming down from the roof you have the benefit of a single ethernet cable coming down from the roof which makes things a lot easier to wire now if you follow this channel for a while you may have heard me talk about the fact that I'm very weary of companies that put the router up on the roof and that's because the vast majority of them that I see use very kind of low quality components and they have a very very high failure rate typically a very common thing we see is that the antenna ports that they install on some of the units that have like a clear top I think folks might know what I'm talking about the rubber literally just snaps off and water gets into it or just they didn't build the components with a high enough quality spec to sustain the elements and specifically the amount of heat that hits this device I've had one of these domes installed on one of two of my RVs for years three plus years the thing is bulletproof it doesn't even turn colors it's such high quality manufacturing components in here and that is reflected somewhat in the price but again you're getting all the benefits of having this device up on the roof so you have your router integrated very close to your 4x4 mimo cellular antennas and allowing you to have that one single output but those higher quality components meaning means you're going to have a lot less likelihood of experiencing a component failure Okay so we've put this outside we've got easier cable access what else makes it different Eric besides just that it's 5G okay so one of my biggest complaints about previous generation HD domes is that they didn't have Wi-Fi all they had was cellular so once you got down into the RV you had to add secondary access points and that meant additional cost and additional complexity in terms of how to configure it all as well as how to wire it all together it was just more confusing for folks so we talked to peplink over the last year and we said guys can you please integrate Wi-Fi into this device and they've delivered so now we have Wi-Fi 6 technology integrated inside the domes we've got our four cellular antennas and then we've also got two Wi-Fi antennas that will broadcast two gigahertz and five gigahertz for your local devices in your marine application or in your RV those Wi-Fi chips in there can also play double duty and can pick up public Wi-Fi using a technology called Wi-Fi as Wan that we talk a lot about on this channel allowing you to pick up Marina or Campground Wi-Fi or any public Wi-Fi that has access and use that as one of the inbound internet sources sticking with the Marine applications for a second a lot of our marine customers when when they start to look at some of our bundles are like how am I going to run these you know six or seven cables up to an antenna deck or up a mast like how am I going to get all this stuff up there and this is really where this comes into play peplink actually designed the original um HD Dome products for the Marine space you have the ability to go 300 plus feet from this device using that single category six cable to the network switch or the poe switch that's going to power this device so that means one single cable raised all the way up to the top of that Mast or to your antenna deck from this device is going to give you that connectivity both on the Wi-Fi Wan side and on the cellular side all with that one cable going back to kind of how you would do a direct OEM replacement on a setup that existed inside of an existing RV that had ethernet up to the roof you'd essentially be mounting this up on the roof and plugging the ethernet cable in using all the supplied Hardware that's pretty straightforward now that ethernet cable is going to Route somewhere inside of the cabin or possibly in the lower kind of what I call basement area where you'll find another device this is actually the one that came out of my RV little kind of generic basic router with a wireless access point and inside of here you're going to see the cable that's going up to the roof you're going to take out this device and you're going to replace it with the poe switch that's going to provide Power to this device from there you can integrate this setup as you've wired it to also fully integrate with any factory installed systems like for me I had a Vega Touch system that allows me to control kind of see the status of my RV turn on my inverters control my shades turn the lights on and off all sorts of stuff and that didn't work particularly well with the factory setup but now that I've upgraded to a solution like this it's working flawlessly as you can kind of see right here on my phone I've got my total RV systems everything that I would access available to me and my RV right now is parked about 300 miles away because my dad borrowed it for the weekend so I have Total Access with The Green Connection status there now if you're interested in understanding how to set that up that's not something we will teach you how to do as part of your purchase but don't worry we've got you covered check out those memberships at membership.mola must have.com inside there we've got a webinar Series where Chris and Sheree and I have actually gone through a bunch of different webinars and we have covered the topics associated with how to get a system that was already installed in your vehicle to work with an upgraded internet solution so that you can be connected all the time peplink has given you a plethora of accessories here with this device it's pretty cool and it's it's a lot because of the various different use cases they've got going on so in one scenario if you're going way up on a on a mast or you want a deck or you've got a standard kind of your one-inch Marine Mount kind of standard Mount there is an optional Mount accessory here that will go straight down into a deck Mount or you can use an existing deck Mount and their bracket will go from this metric threaded connection down to your standard Marine Mount and you can run your wire straight through that if you've got existing mounts that doesn't mean you necessarily need to buy anything extra if you're looking at this but if you're in a marine specific application that optional accessory which I'll put down below may be of interest of you to you because of an existing setup in terms of higher wires are operating what this guy here does is this is basically a two Port switch so this gives you an additional Lan Port up by this antenna if necessary some folks may want to add in an additional wireless access point at a secondary location or maybe they're jumping over to a different device so you're getting that additional Wan port with this unit so this will accept ethernet and power to power up the device via Poe and then it will also pass through Poe out on the Lan 2 ports all the ports here are included with waterproof connectors and you have all the various accessories to take existing category five and six cables and run them in and then tighten them down with cable grommets to keep the elements out once you've got this lower device secured this optional Mount here will connect directly to the device giving you an optional surface mount that would operate just like this now this Mount also has the ability to be mounted this way meaning that it does support pole mount applications I would not recommend that for the RV and Marine space typically because it is going to give the antenna a directional bias by being mounted at an angle like that but it is technically supported and is possible typically where we see that is when it's being mounted to the side of a building where they know exactly where their cell tower is and they've got a building behind them so they're like look this has to be just pointed in that direction it is a supported configuration and in testing it does work quite well but by default best performance is to mount it in the vertical position so here is the optional Sim injector now you do not need a SIM injector for this device to operate especially if you're just looking for basic internet if you pick up a high gigabyte cellular data plan that's kind of hard to get from the carriers directly which you can pick one up from mobilemustave.com just go onto the internet page and click on cellular data plans in our main menu you'll see a bunch bunch of options there or they're listed also on the on the router pages so plans for just about any carrier you can pick up one of those data plans and you can just pop it right into this device we'll show you in a minute where that occurs but there are a couple screws here looks like six of them and this just pops right off and there are two SIM card slots that you can select from directly in the device so you could load this up with say your primary data plan being let's say it's T-Mobile one of our high gigabyte plans or Verizon or whatever and then you can put in a blank Sim in the second slot so that it's there if you need it without you having to go up to the roof or a pre-activated one and then you can switch between the two carriers right out of this device so you're getting dual SIM slots in the device without any additional Sim injector but the Sim injector gives you eight more Sims so that gives you a total of 10 SIM cards that you have access to through this device so the Sim injector here which is optional as you can see here we've got one two three four five six seven eight SIM card slots these are full size 2ff SIM card slots so be careful if you do pick one of these up do not put small Nano Sims got into here you then have four ethernet ports or Lan ports that are available here as well and these are all Poe out these Supply the poe 48 voltage to power this device and it could technically power more than one Dome if you were interested in it meaning you could plug fluid ohms into this and then I'm sorry three domes into this and then Uplink the fourth port to a command center router like a mbx or something like that that had support for that many Wan sources so that is very doable but for the average customer we're going to basically be saying this goes into here and that powers the device from a lan perspective and then you've got a couple extra ports inside of your setup for local devices like desktop computers or whatnot if security cameras all sorts of things that can run on Poe and if your device doesn't need Poe this will automatically turn off power it will not damage a non-poe device now this device will support DC power input but it's 56 volt DC power in in order to enable the poe so a lot of people are like how do I get 56 volt DC the answer is our DC power converter which is exclusive to mobilemustave.com this is an option as well and this has included all of this is included in our new bundle called the Globetrotter bundle which is coming out very soon so what this will do is you can wire those two up to your house batteries and then these two out here will output 56 volts so this will take 12 volts up to 56 volts boom now you've got Poe for your devices and your remote similar injector is powered up so that you can uh not have to go up and mess with this when you want to swap out sim cards going over quickly just what's in the box really quick we've got our HD Dome mobile router we have our little two Port switch we have our surface mount slash wall mount uh adapter that comes included we have our washer and locking nut that will lock the Dome uh into place if you're going to be using this in a flat mounted application uh in like kind of a an automotive roof or something you typically wouldn't use that if you're using any of these other brackets but they do include it which is nice if you've got your two weatherproof cable grommets for your category five or six ethernet ports that are right here where ethernet cables I should say that are right there you've got u-bolts for a pull mount adapter you've got mollies and wood screws for if you're going to drill this into the side of a building nice touch you got some cable management branded stuff just to make you part of the peplink family and then you've got your accessory Associated screws for mounting up all of the accessories that you see here all comes in the Box the HD Dome one 5G also includes the AP controller for controlling secondary access points that's a nice touch if you're looking at a larger implementation or in a you're in a situation where the Wi-Fi that's in this antenna is going to be a little bit too far from your clients to broadcast effectively like a large antenna large Mast on a sailboat could be potentially an issue where if you're so high up the clients that are down below deck like your laptops and whatnot may not pick up the signal not to worry this includes the wireless AP controller so you can pick up I would recommend typically the APA X light access point to pair with this really nicely that way you have broadcasting Wi-Fi from down below now that's not this say you're not going to continue to use the wireless up in the device itself because you still can use that wireless as Wan technology to pick up your Marina Wi-Fi from up here and if you're ever away from your setup this will broadcast much further distances from up high for access to your Wi-Fi from kind of the dock area or the campground area if you're doing this in an RV application thank you guys so much for watching our

let's do it [Music] all right guys so today we're going to be installing a pep wave Mobility 42 seven in one roof antenna and that gives us some of the newer technology sell signal stuff and the brand new Cutting Edge top of the line Transit Pro modem which is a dual capable dual cellular capable modem that has a category 7 modem that's really good for T-Mobile sorry to geek out a little bit and a category 12 modem that's really good for a t and Verizon the category 7 will work with ATT and Verizon as well but Mark and Julie from RV love have been spending some time traveling with T-Mobile as their carrier and I've been seeing really fast speeds so we want to get them upgraded to a modem that supports that band 71 and gets them those faster speeds on the T-Mobile network yeah what he said because we're not super technology but we loved our pep wave in our country coach because we had that for years it was amazing we had the Dual Sim and we had a rooftop antenna so it's been a couple years since we had that installation so we're really excited to get the newest latest and greatest the better antenna like you said for the new bands for the T-Mobile and better coverage on the ATT as well so super excited to do the install yeah so what are bands all that stuff we don't have to get crazy into that we've got plenty of blog articles on that but bands are a lot like TV channels and you want to pick up as many channels as possible so that you can get the best speeds in the most amount of locations so your old modem was a was a dual category six which is a great modem but it missed out on a lot of stuff that has come out since we put that in so now we're adding a bunch of bands we'll put below you're you're covered it's like cable TV we got lots of numbers down there now we've got a lot more coverage which is great yeah so I mean the goal is that you don't really have to deal with any of this you just kind of leave it on and then you can do your Zoom calls and talk to all your fans that's what we learned about the pepboy before super reliable super predictable all always always stable always on is just like home internet just love that now while this modem is we're focusing on this being a dual modem device meaning you can connect to two cellular providers at once and if you look at the back there's a lot of antennas back there a lot of people ask us if this is a 5G modem and the answer is no it's not and the reason is because if this was 5G we would need four additional antenna ports back there but the antenna that we're putting on the roof is a 5G capable antenna so we are future proofing ourself for that for when the prices do come down on the 5G stuff nice all right so tell me a little bit about what you're thinking for the install here well this rig already has a solar panels on the roof and it has a solar panel junction box so I would love to be able to use the same roof hole that's in that solar box and try and go down through that we'll see how that works out it is kind of close to the other solar and we'll see how it mounts the antenna we got to figure out a way to mount the antenna nearby so as you can see here we have a junction box box that we picked up at Home Depot it's just an eight by eight eight inch by eight inch by four inch waterproof junction box you can pick up at any electrical supply shop the goal here is that we're going to install the antenna this guy on top of that box and then we either will run out the side of the box into that solar junction box or if we find something that we you know we we saw some some tape on the top of the box I was like we may want to take this box off we don't know what we're really going to find so we may just replace that box completely we'll see when we get up there now if you haven't noticed I'm giving Mark all of the Dirty Jobs [Music] all right so we've found we did think that junction box might be a problem and it's turning out to be a little bit of one yeah much bigger problem than we usually thought we just thought it was a little crack that had been had some tape over but when we actually removed it we could see the actual when it got cracked something happened and those wires were frayed actually could have been a real fire safety hazard and so we're removing all of those wires and we're going to connect cut them back and make a nice clean connection with new wired Junctions so that's gonna be a lot better A lot safer [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] so we did it and I don't have any diaper on my black shirt that never ever happened so I get to keep this one that's a really good score yeah I mean I I just think that now you have total accessibility right so if you wanted to add additional solar panels um you know from the previous owner or the factory we're not really sure but we have that nice big two inch hole in the roof that now is basically lined up perfectly with that box and you can you're you know now if you want to add anything or bring anything down for the roof you don't have to drill another hole yes nice and simple no new hulls looks really clean really professional and I'm super happy because we've got all the new technology on here total internet connectivity on the road yeah we're gonna upload this video with that new technology foreign [Music]", "snippet": {"publishedAt":

fiberglass carbon black antenna mask pull complete with ladder and suction Mount brackets come along with us and we'll tell you all about it [Music] thanks so much for joining us guys and this has certainly been a labor of love for me I've been working on centenna for or this antenna mask for over a year we actually have this exact unit installed uh Chris and Cherie from the mobile internet Resource Center have been testing this for us for quite a few months now I think about six months at this point on their Travato Winnebago I think it's a 19 foot van and it's been working great they utilize our ladder Mount which we'll talk about in a minute so summary of what you've got here this is a telescoping antenna Mast that is manufactured out of fiberglass in carbon black fiberglass is rigid but also flexible but most importantly it's lightweight and it's really easy to pack up and travel and that's why we selected it for the material that we wanted to use for our first antenna Mass product that we are manufacturing directly through a partner the antenna Mast has these nice cam locks here and and at its closed height you're looking at about 67 inches or so making it about six feet or so long maybe a little bit less and at its full height you're looking at 20 feet of extendable vertical range so it's got quite a bit of range that would get you if you had it on the ground on a motorhome like this probably close to about eight feet above your roof line but with our mounting solution that we'll talk about in a little bit you can mount it quite a bit higher up off the ground if you want to get up even higher you might see some competitive products even ones that we sell that are 25 foot masts four section masks we actually started with a 25 foot Mast and we moved it down to a 20 to save on weight and because we found that in most of our testing environments with most of our customers and influencers they weren't extending it all the way and it was just adding weight so we said you know what let's look at doing a 20 foot it and then working and kind of focusing on how we Mount this to the RV to create enough height and flexibility for our customers that fiberglass really gives us some rigidity but it also allows us to to be a little bit thinner here because it's so flexible in some of the competing products so we're at about 1.8 inches at the base here for our base diameter and up at the top here we're about 1.4 inches at our base stand our upper segment diameter 1.2 inches or more is typically what you need for just about any pole mounted antenna to secure to it properly using the included u-bolts that come with just about every single pole mounted antenna that you see at mobile must have or anywhere else when manufacturing this antenna mask we wanted to make sure we included very high quality and components that were weather resistant and as you can see here I'll do a close-up these cam locks that you see on this device are used using all weather resistant stainless Hardware so that means you're going to be cutting down on just the stuff that you see with a lot of Manufacturers where it comes out of the box it looks great you leave it out there for a couple weeks and you come out and it's just you know rusted solid and you can't even get it down so stainless Hardware on these cam locks as well as a really high quality ABS that we've used here weather resistant ABS to ensure that you have years and years of reliable use on this antenna Mast flipping this guy over for a second we have a removable cap here that you can just go ahead and remove if necessary if this is out in you know wet conditions water can Ingress into the pole which is fine and it will just drain right off the bottom that's another nice thing about fiberglass is it doesn't care if it gets wet it can drain out the bottom some of our customers have actually drilled a hole in the bottom of this and just left it on and some of our customers have just taken off the cap and entirely but I recommend keeping it on there just to ensure that you don't damage the pole when you're walking around with it zooming you guys way out for a second I just want to show you how quick and easy this is to go ahead and put up now you can go ahead and raise these up and they've got nice stops you know when you get right to the top and it's as quick and easy as just exiting out or flipping out that cam lock and then just going ahead and increasing this all the way up look at how high that thing will get you up to it really gets you up there lowering the antenna mask is just as easy flip open those cams and just go ahead and pull it down there are adjustable screws here which I'll show you a close-up on that can allow you to adjust the tension of that cam lock so that it will lower or raise at the speed that you're comfortable with because we've got nice tight fittings here between each of the sections it actually creates a little bit of resistance there slowing down the ability for it to compress which can be nice if you've got a heavier antenna mounted at the top now the pole and mounting hardware are sold separately so if you already have a mounting method you can go ahead and just make sure that the diameter 1.4 inches or so on the lower will work with your existing mounting method but the optional mounting kit is pretty unique in that it gives you the ability to utilize a suction cup mounting system that will give you four high strength suction cup points of contact on the side of the RV um or the exact same mounting kit can also Mount to a standard ladder Mount now most RVs have a standard ladder Mount of just one inch tube that they that they utilize for the ladders and our Locking System here can utilize either our suction mounts or ladder mounts I'll demonstrate kind of how that works and then I'll actually go ahead and just put it on the RV as well when designing this mounting solution we really wanted something that had a lot of ease of use and flexibility and that was going to be able to pack up and tear down very quickly and also create something that wasn't going to create permanent installation marks on the RV if possible or whatever installation you know requirements you need maybe you're not doing this in an RV this is pretty flexible in terms of what you can use it for but giving you a high level of what you see here you've got a small locking clamp here on one end that is designed for the ladder Mount or for the suction cup mount and on the other side uh virtually identical version of the same thing that's designed for the pole itself these flip out of the way locking clamps are adjustable and you don't have to fully remove the hardware here in order to release the clamp making them much more flexible for quick release another thing that we heard from customers when they were testing this is that they wanted to see a pivot point in the middle here that would allow them to change the orientation of the mounting location perhaps you have a rail mounted this way like in a marine application and you want to mount to the side that way these have the ability to turn in that Center pivot point and that includes a locking nylon nut in the middle so you can once you have that in the orientation you want lock this down so it doesn't move included on the larger pole side of the clamp here also in addition to a flat washer and a locking washer which is an included on both sides is a secondary lock washer here and we asked them to include that for customers that aren't interested in removing this from the pole very often and they want that second locking nut so essentially what you can do is you can attach this to the pole use a wrench to carefully fiberglass can crack carefully uh tighten up to the pole and then you can use the wing nut at the top as an added lock nut for additional security and then during travel days you can just use the quick release on your ladder side or your suction side depending on which installation method you're going with giving you a summary of kind of how this would all work first off you have two clamps and two suction cups included in the kit so a total of four pieces now we've also included metal locking points here for the suction cups it came with plastic ones and we asked them to upgrade these to metal but we did include the backups plastic ones since we'd already paid for them in the kits so that if you're ever wondering why they're a plastic black handle tabs in the Box it's just an extra set that you can install if you want but we find that these weatherproof aluminum handles do a really good job of making sure that we have good suction but check showing you quickly what this looks like let me put this all together and kind of show you what it would look like installed all right so we'll start by installing our clamp on the pole side I'm just going to go ahead and unscrew our locking nuts I'm putting my flat washer and my locking washer on the side on the outside of this clamp to ensure that it's going to stay nice and tight and I'm going to go ahead and tighten my wing nut there to make sure I have a good solid connection there now for customers that want really fast quick access you can actually remove this locking nut on the inside and just use the flat washer locking washer and the wing nut that will work more than fine but you've got that extra nut in the kit in case you need it then on this side pretty straightforward you're repeating the process this is just going to go on the ladder on the back of the RV or if it's on a marine application you might turn it this way and now you can go on a railing if you're looking to utilize the suction mounts same size clip that you see here so this is a one inch fitting there so you'd be able to go ahead and put that right in there and tighten and lock that up giving you a single one piece solution here go ahead and tighten that up on the opposite side you're essentially repeating the process if you're attaching that to your ladder Mount it's pretty straightforward your ladder is going to go right through there you're going to swing close that lock and tighten it shut making sure you've got your flat and lock washer on the outside to ensure this doesn't come loose flipping that up if maybe it's a marine application you want to mount along a rail you can do that as well just go ahead and tighten once you know what your installation requirement is you want to go ahead and tighten that nut on the inside to make sure it doesn't spin on you if you're going to be using the suction Mount which I'll show you right here he would it's obviously a lot easier if this is already installed on the RV but I'll go ahead and just kind of show you from a demonstration perspective what it looks like before I hop over to the RV and show you it installed in the real world you would obviously repeat that same process go ahead and tighten up this on the suction Mount and boom you're good to go all right so before we get started hopping up on the motorhome we're going to zoom out and just give you a time lapse of me installing this pole just to show you how quick and easy it is to install I'm going to go ahead and use these suction mounts because my motorhome which is an Integra motor coach does not have a ladder we've used these I've had these guys stuck on the outside of the motorhome for months to be honest I would recommend you go out and check them every few days just to be certain but these suction cups are very very strong and do the job great at staying connected to the RV just about any time that you need them to the key to making sure that these stay connected is making sure that you prep the surface and that it is glass you know glass gloss clean before you start the installation now if you have a fiberglass motorhome that doesn't have full paint make sure that the paint is in or the gel coat is in real really really good gloss condition you might have to get that compounded and then polished and waxed to give it that nice kind of gloss finish before you utilize a suction Mount now if you don't have a glossy location to mount something like this too you can potentially in a pinch Mount to a window but I encourage folks to be really really careful if they're mounting to a window for an installation application most Windows especially frameless Windows like this on an Integra are uh their double pane glass windows meaning the exterior and the interior are connected to each other with glue and by adding something like this to an exterior window you could potentially crack that glue and create a situation where you've separated the windows from the inside and the outside so we don't recommend that you mount these two glass or to Windows it will work but you know do it at your own risk because you might potentially damage the window especially if there's any wind or you're adding a lot of weight to this antenna we've tested this with antennas that are four four and a half up to five pounds in weight but you got to really use common sense it's obviously going to be weather dependent you know high winds are going to change what you can mount to this and the sort of size or the surface area of that antenna may impact how wind reacts to it so especially when you're getting started make sure you do your testing and if you find yourself in this situation where you're worried or you're experiencing any challenges with the antenna mask you can always lower the mounting point or just simply lower the Mast a little bit to strengthen the rigidity of this to give yourself a little bit more rigidity in those environmental conditions all right so we've got you guys zoomed out a little bit so there's a couple different choices here you know normally we do separate videos with installation versus product overview but we're going to kind of show you both in this and then we'll do future subsequent videos so a lot of customers are completely happy just leaving the base of this on the ground here and you know you obviously got to watch out for me I've got a generator exhaust here so be careful to avoid any hot heat sources or any panels that you need access to but you can you know have this Seated on the ground like this and then do a suction cup mount right here for example and then above the window for example now one nice thing about this kit is the cam locks that are included here or the the the mounting brackets here that are included will mount to the lower two sections of this pole without issue so you can mount down here and then if you flip that open you have enough diameter in the second section as well to mount up there so it gives you a little bit more mounting flexibility now for my installation today I'm going to actually Mount this up like this just to show you how extreme you can get with getting this nice and high by mounting something up like this this would give me the ability since I'm starting at almost five or six feet I'd be getting 25 26 feet up in a mounting installation like this now a lot of people are like oh I want more height I want more height absolutely that's great but just keep in mind that most of the antennas that are sold are going to come with 15 feet of cable so by the time you get that high and then you've got to get in to the vehicle as well through a roof access port where a lot of folks are going to go through a window like this you might have a a cable situation that's another reason why we went with a 20-foot Mast here because this just seemed to be the right blend of good size with that low weight and ease of portability all right but like we said before the key to success here is prep now I've got a ceramic coating on my vehicle so I'm going to use Groot ceramic speed shine polish just to clean up my Surface and get it nice and glossy before I start if you don't have a ceramic coating I love Luca's slick Mist you can pick this up on Amazon or just about any auto parts store it's called speed wax it doesn't really feel like a wax product as much as it just feels like a quick detailing product this is an awesome product to just quickly get that surface nice and clean so you have good adhesion all right we're going to get the ladder set up and show you how this can be installed nice quick and easy foreign [Music] I had to put the camera practically in the woods just to give you guys the ability to see how high that is if you look above the trees there in this shot you're going to see the tip of that this guy is probably oh I'd say that's 15 or so plus feet above the roof line we are way up there uh maybe I'm a little overestimating it but I don't think so now I've installed this suction mount in both orientations just to show you how I've got it vertically at the top and I've got it horizontally at the bottom now if you're going to mess around with this antenna Mass we definitely recommend that if you're going to install this solo you keep the base on the ground especially when you've got the weight of the antenna at the top there that can definitely add to some complexity there so if you're going to install it solo I'd keep it on the small on the lower side if you want to install it like this best to have a helper with you somebody who can be on either the roof or on the ground just to hold that antenna while you're maneuvering yourself on the ladder don't put yourself in danger but a tremendous amount of flexibility with this product to give you the ability to mount Direct functional and omnidirectional Wi-Fi or cellular or Wi-Fi cellular antennas as you can see here another note on the installation I always recommend that you do the top bracket first that way gravity is on your side the bottom of the pole will hang and kind of balance down in this channel when you're removing this from the bracket it's the opposite I recommend you remove the bottom first and then go up to the top and loosen that up and then you can slowly bring that down to the ground before telescoping down the Mast if you're in a situation where you can bring the mass down earlier that may make it easier as well if you're already up on the roof and you just want to bring down the antenna Mast before you bring down the entire Mast you just want to bring down sections that works as well just remember be safe and none of this is that important it's just internet your safety is the most important thing so just make sure to always have a spotter and be careful out there all right guys it's on there it's not going anywhere that's for sure thank you guys so much for watching I'm actually going to take this antenna Mast and all these clamps and mounts and I'm sending this down to Andy from our team you see him on our YouTube channel a lot he's down in the Dallas area he's having some trouble with a local cell tower and he's got some directional panel antennas that he's going to test this with for you guys he's got a ladder on his uh fifth wheel so that means he's going to be able to also show how the ladder works and also show how to clamp on an antenna to this as well so that'll be coming in future videos if you have any questions at all you can always reach out to us at mobilemustab.com in the bottom right hand corner you'll see a link to chat with an expert you can also email us at info mobile must have.com and new for 2022 we're also doing scheduled callbacks if you want to talk to an expert about any of our products and services so you can just chat or email us in and tell them that you want to schedule a consultation and we can take care of that as well thank you guys so much for watching and

{"id": "fA5TCZkgSdc", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "W6u_uTjBz8-fzJYEWPeZJE_CaF8", "transcript": "hi guys this is andy from mobile must have in this video i'm really excited to give you the first and early look to the new parsec great pyramids antenna [Music] now what's super special about this antenna is this is the first ever 11 in one antenna how that breaks down is you're going to have eight cellular antennas two wi-fi and one gps this thing has a lot of stuff packed inside of it now this might be looking familiar to you as this is in the same body style and really housing as the parsec husky which is mustaf's current number one kind of selling and performing antenna on our store really excited that they were able to get the parsec was able to get such antennas such technology in this continuously small housing now to again to kind of go over what this is so this is going to be eight cellular antennas two wi-fi one gps this is designed for kind of a dual 5g modem setup there are great routers coming out from pepwave that are going to be dual 5g you've got the br2 pro this pairs perfectly with that one as well as the mbx mini if you were going more on the enterprise side and these are great options however if you have an existing modem maybe you have a transit duo or some of the older transits like a cat 18 that were a four by four mimo or two two by two memos or you still had four cables and you wanted to add another modem this is a really great antenna now i have one antenna the same kind of footprint as we had before but i now have all that extra coverage in one thing um this will work if you just wanted to use one 4x4 antenna and just have kind of the other set as extras you can totally do that too couple other specs to go over with this antenna is the connection points you're going to have 11 connection points because you have 11 antennas you're gonna have eight cellular two wi-fi one gps the eight cellular are going to be sma your gps is going to be sma uh but your wi-fi is going to be rp sma they switch those so you can't put wi-fi on sell and sell on wi-fi they kind of make that simple now that's done across the board that's how the pep waves are done and the antennas are designed to match that perfectly so no adapters needed or anything now we also really like the cables that parsec uses they use the lsr200 it's just going to be a little bit beefier of a cable and what that means is less signal loss over the run of the cable itself the lower the kind of the thinner cables you use the more loss you're going to have especially over longer runs lastly is about mounting so we will link i'll link another video here around the husky and how we have mounting options for the husky there's typically two mounting options for this antenna the first which is this example which would be a flat mount which basically you drill a hole you stuff the wires through and you can mount this right on top that could be your roof that could be a junction box that you're mounting this on that then is on a roof or something like that lots of options this is an adhesive seal so this will stick to whatever that surface is and then give you a really good water tight kind of feeling there the other option is typically a magnet mount i'll put a clip in here of that again you'll have to confirm with the listing if these are available in magnet mounts at this time if they are you can see that on the listing page the magnum mounts are great if you're putting this on a metal roof or i actually have one on my roof and i've just put a metal sheet down instead of drilling a hole and then i ran my cables through my solar mount so lots of options and we have more mounting options available and i'll link another video here to kind of go over some of those mounting options now for the next part of this video we wanted to give you some real world kind of examples of signal gain you get from this over just kind of generic cell phone signal unfortunately though i'm just not in the right place for that i have so many self towers around me i get five bars no matter what i do and turn off so i'm gonna pass this over to eric where he's in a much better place to kind of test this all right eric catch nice throw a little 1500 mile or so throw from texas to new hampshire where we are right now did you know that parsec actually tests every single antenna that they make for customers so 100 of the products that they ship not just random testing they test these before they get into the box and before they get to customers to make sure that you're getting the specs and the quality that they claim on their spec sheets we're up in new hampshire in southern central new hampshire and self-service here is notoriously poor my family's from this area we've been up here for 30 plus years and we always fight with cell service and the ability to have internet in this location as you can kind of see here i'll give you a close-up of my phone we can typically make a phone call outside or send a text message with one bar or no bars of service but you can't hold a call for more than i don't know 30 to 60 seconds it's very spotty so it's a good place or opportunity for us to get some real world testing what i want to do is test this 8x8 great pyrenees antenna against our husky which is a 4x4 antenna in the same housing to verify that they're getting very similar performance results when parsec made the decision to put eight antenna elements on the cellular inside this 11 inch housing there's a lot going on and some of the first questions we asked were did you guys have to make the elements smaller is there any degradation and performance what kind of happened here and their response to us was that because they had enough surface area in here they were able to use the same high performance antenna elements that we've always known and loved in the husky and they've been able to add four additional inside of the save housing without affecting the performance in a way that we would really notice at all i've got a husky magnet mount installed on top of a box on my integra motor coach that's just behind us i'm actually going to install this on basically a very similar box it's not a magnet mount but they should perform very similarly in these installations we are not using ground planes although they are recommended if you want to get the best possible performance parsec has released a very very cool 20 inch by 20 inch adhesive backed ground plane that's very easy to install we'll link to that video below but these are designed to work without ground planes so they are very very suitable for the rv and the mobile market this should be a pretty apples apples comparison on the husky versus the great pyrenees but we're also going to show you the difference on what it looks like if we just use the small paddle antennas we're going to be using a peplink max br2 dual 5g cellular router mobile router today and that's going to pair really nicely with the great pyrenees because that router requires eight cellular antennas to perform across those two 5g modems all right let's get started all right welcome to my little mobile office here so before we get started uh based on what andy said to confirm a few things we are stocking this in black and in white we are stocking this in the standard adhesive mount which you can use on a pole mount if you want as well as the magnet mount which you see here and we are stocking this in our custom seven foot cable configuration as well as our 15 foot cable configuration it's always good to note that if you can get that cable length shorter you're going to have better performance there's a lot of loss in cellular signal and wi-fi signal due to the cable now parsec has done a really good job as they always do a lot of customers are like how come parsec so much more expensive it's a lot of it's in the components besides the fact that these are made in america and they are tested so there's a lot more that goes into these antennas to ensure that what it says on that spec sheet is really what you're getting but on the component side these big fat thick cables are lsr 200 cables so they're using a higher higher quality cable that's going to carry less loss than most of the competition that you'll see use cables that are in the you know 100 series or so or so size another nice touch they've done here this is a prototype so they haven't shrink wrapped this but you'll notice that they've got a a really nice nylon braid here so we're not dealing with 11 cables all just kind of randomly all on their own so they've given us a little bit of a tie here and this just really helps for cable management when you're dealing with a decent sized bundle in terms of hole size here for the bundle you're looking at about a a one inch or so and then for this it's a 1.25 i believe we'll put that in the description uh for how that mounts um exactly the same as the husky antenna in previous iterations if you do have questions about mounting this adhesive mount magnet mount ground planes all those things we have tons of videos on that stuff and you can always reach out to us via chat or via email at info mobilemustav.com or chat in the bottom right hand corner but for today as we're going to get started here's our brand new dual 5g br2 they're going to be using for testing we're only going to be testing today on the verizon network because honestly in this particular area that's pretty much all we can get access to so what we're going to be doing is testing a single antenna in the great pyrenees against the existing husky that i have up on the roof we are testing in the 15 foot cable configurations today because that's what i have and these will all match um and then we're going to fire up a second verizon sim card in the same br2 and see if those signal changes change a lot or significantly we expect them to change a little bit that's normal when you've got all those antennas in one uh you know housing or case and just get a kind of an idea of how they perform uh inside of that antenna compared to the husky we've got ourselves a mounting box here this is just a home depot box it's a 12 by 12 by 6 mounting box that's become pretty popular for folks that install on rvs that have raised rails or gerard awnings that may be made out of metal and if you want to get the antenna up above it this is a really cheap and inexpensive way to do so so i'm going to drill a hole in the top of this box and a hole out the side of this box this is a temporary installation but this will allow it to sit up on the roof and look very similar to my existing magnet mount that's already up there that's hardwired into the coach and then we're going to run the wires down the side in the window and power up and start our testing let's get started [Music] all right look at that we're all set with a nice temporary setup here our antenna is mounted up on the top of this box our wires are out the side and we're good to go if you were looking to do a permanent install like this we did a video on pat bauer the president of the integra owners association's coach where we installed it just like this and we give a bit more details about how to use this box we did not attach the adhesive mount we haven't done any dicor nothing like this because it's a temporary setup so just be mindful of that if you are looking to do something like that you can search on our channel we've got a detailed video on how to install one of these boxes so this is going to hop up on the roof we're going to place it next to our existing husky in kind of a similar area try to be you know at least 18 inches away from any electronics motors from air conditioners etc what not to make sure we don't get interference from those pieces of technology and then we're going to plug in our br2 and get some initial readings and start the testing let's go [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right ready to get some testing done sorry about the ac noise so we're going to start by installing our verizon sim cards into the br2 and we're going to hook up the modem one because the husky only has four elements so we're going to hook up the old antenna the traditional husky to modem one and get some baseline readings and then we'll swap over and check out the great pyrenees let's get started [Music] [Music] all right so real quick before we get started i do want to mention something because a lot of these videos end up becoming helpful for people post-purchase on the back of the br2 you've got uh eight cellular antenna connections and modem one will be designated by one and modem two will be designated by two followed by a letter so it's 1 a b c d and 2 a b c d on the antenna it's simply labeled lte one two three four five six seven eight so which wires go where it's very simple on modem one you're going to use lte one two three and four and on modem two you're gonna use lte five six seven and eight the order doesn't necessarily matter but the official answer is go ahead and put them in the exact order wi-fi is very simple there's two wi-fi hook them up to the two wi-fi ports and gps is gps and that's pretty much it so let's get into the testing all right so i did a little bit of baseline testing so as you saw on my phone outside i'm getting basically one bar and there's something called field test mode on the phone that allows you to actually get in and see your your rs rp values which is kind of short for like your lte signal strength closer to zero is better and the numbers show up as negatives so when i was outside here as you can see i was showing about well negative 117 and when i came inside it got a little bit worse 124 is about what i'm seeing so pretty abysmal and you know it's got tiny little antennas inside of a phone it's comparing a big roof antenna to this is it's not really useful information what's really useful for us is what happens when we compare this to other other roof antennas mainly the husky so i did a baseline on the husky antenna that i have already pre-installed on the roof and the br 2 with that verizon sim and we are also um just to be clear we're on band 13 with verizon so it's important that we're on the same band when we look at these tests the husky and the br2 came in at a signal strength of 107. so significantly better 124 to 107 is like the difference of like two bars we'll say in some cases and you can see that as it reflects on the screen that you see here i've got three signal bars so we've jumped up quite a bit in improvement and i actually have a stable lte connection which is great so that's kind of what we've always seen with our husky antenna so now i'm going to swap over and we're going to plug in all of the l the eight cellular elements on the great pyrenees we're going to put a second sim card in the br2 and we're going to power up both of those verizon modems we'll lock them to band 13 and we'll see how the signal strengths look compared to that husky [Music] all right so we've got our eight cellular elements connected and as you can see here we've got our two verizon sim cards online and they are both connected to band 13 and they're both showing lte with three signal bars on the dashboard all right just kind of cutting to the chase uh we're seeing a a signal value here of 109 so we were at 107 before and we're at 109 now now i did some testing up on the roof i repositioned things i turned some antennas around and i was able to interchangeably get each of these antennas to reverse to 109 or 107. they're kind of hovering in those two decibel ranges based on what i'm seeing here so you know i'm kind of giving you the worst results that i got which is the 109 number and the best results that i got which is the 107 number so they're within two decibels of each other testing this out turning off one of the mode one of the routers and just using one of the antenna elements we saw some minor fluctuations maybe a decibel nothing too too crazy and there's obviously a lot of environmental factors that come into play this is not a scientific test so the short answer of what we're seeing in this antenna is that they've packed eight elements into this tiny little well it's big but we'll call it tiny for 10 inches it's the smallest form factor 11 and 1 antenna that we've seen to date that exists on the market for sure and the performance is pretty pretty solid the fact that it's a 600 megahertz all the way up to 6 gigahertz performance antenna giving you access to 5g and all of those bands and they packed eight elements into this um while looking like the the signal strength isn't greatly affected is pretty solid now band 13 runs at i think 850 megahertz it's on the lower spectrum so it requires a larger bit of antenna surface area to get a good signal so we thought that'd be kind of an interesting band to check higher frequency bands that run in the 2 000 megahertz spectrum would be less affected by the amount of antennas in that casing so this is kind of a good test to run overall but again not a super scientific one this is a new product but it's a really good pairing from what we can tell to that br2 dual 5g mobile router all right folks well hopefully you found that information informative and that can give you some information about whether or not the great pyrenees antenna is going to be a good fit for you as time progresses since this is a brand new antenna there may be more information always make sure to check out the independent analysis tab on our listing pages not every listing page has it but we're working to add them each and every day on the independent analysis tab you will get links to guides and information from the mobile internet resource center located at rvmobileinternet.com and when they do hands-on testing of antennas which they do quite a bit of especially on the popular models which we suspect this one will be they will provide analysis and information and mobile must have nor no one else compensates them for that information we link that to you to our customers so that they can make informed decisions if you are potentially interested in diving deeper into the mobile internet resource

{"id": "wCQNQPFHOyI", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "ScHklc-6fk7KAO06gVqt_xwtaq8", "transcript": "hey guys eric from mobilemusthave.com here and today we want to tell you about our six circuit fuse block that we have for connecting accessories in mobile applications [Music] so a lot of customers have asked us what this is because it is listed as an optional accessory on a lot of our mobile connectivity products and we'll get into that if you're looking to just hook up a mobile internet solution device that we sell at mobilemust.com like a peplink device like you see here and that's all you're going to be doing from an accessory standpoint you may not need this uh you'll see on those listing pages we also include an optional 12-volt direct wire fused adapter that is uh set up specific to the model router that you purchase and comes pre-installed with the fuse that you need so this is typically all you need if you're interested in just powering up a device like this that said if you're like me and you find that as your connectivity evolves and as your setup evolves you might find that there's more accessories that you want to mount in that central kind of tech cabinet that you might have inside of your rv or marine application and in those situations having a bunch of singular wires and fuses all over the place can be a bit messy and that's where looking at something like this where you have a centralized fuse box can come in really handy for the longest time on my personal blog livenlight.net we were implementing uh solutions just like this we actually used a product that was by a marine company called blue c systems that had a six circuit fuse block just like this they're just a little bit expensive and this actually has a feature that i like that the blue seat didn't have which is that if one of my fuses blows this actually has a light on it that will tell me that the fuse is out before we get into the wiring and kind of how this works i'll just kind of go over what comes in the box you've got this nice clear protective cover that will go over the fuses that's removable you've got the fuse block itself here it's a six circuit fuse blocks that takes atc style sort of standard automotive blade fuses they include six fuses in the kit i believe there's two three amp fuses which are perfect for pep link devices a 5 amp a 10 amp a 15 amp and a 20 amp so you get the fuses in this kit and you also get installation screws to screw this to the wall there's four mounting holes on the corners to give you a nice clean installation they've also gone one step further which is kind of nice they've included a bunch of labels here that you can go ahead and use to label the circuits with sort of just stuff that's you know your pre defined stuff that you might put into a mobile application i personally use a dymo label maker and i just put my labels right here on the outside with my label printer and that works fine but you can use these and there are some blanks at the bottom as well that you can write on with a white um with one of those white markers since the labels are black but it can be done or just use a label maker like i said now what i like about this fuse block in addition to it providing fused circuits up here for my 12 volt positive is they've also provided a grounding block down here so this is really a central wiring area now what you would do is you would find a a large enough cable in your existing environment that is going to your batteries that's running 12 volts you can pick up a multimeter at home depot or just about anywhere and you can test the wire locations and find where you have 12 volt positive and negative a lot of times you'll find that there are wiring locations already in media cabinets with nice thick wire call it you know 18 gauge or or greater the lower the number the thicker the wire um depending on what you want to do just make sure you size that wiring properly but you can take existing potential wiring as long as it's fused for enough wire and you can run it right up to these main terminal inputs your 12 volt positive is up top and your 12 volt negative is down below and what that will do is that will enable all of these ports to now put out 12 volt output now the grounds you can connect up basically whatever's closest to your fused circuit and then right next to the fuse to the right or to the left is where your 12 volt will go so and in between where your hookup is and that main bus bar for 12 volts is your fuse which means you're protected if you have a short circuit or that wire is somehow overloaded and getting hot you can that fuse will blow to protect the wiring inside your rv if you don't find that you have 12 volt already run to that location you can of course run it directly from uh the 12 volt house batteries to get you up to this and then this can become basically your main distribution point for your accessories in terms of installing fuses it's just like atc fuses have been around forever they're what's in pretty much every car so they just go ahead and lock into the center location and you press them down and they lock into place now again those lights that are right next to the fuse will turn on solid red if the fuse is blown so that's a really nice touch in terms of just wanting to quickly know if you've got a fuse out or not the fact that the block will tell you is great you do not need to use all six circuits for the the for the fuse block to function you can have just one typically i start out with one maybe two when i implement something like this and then i find over the months and the years whenever i'm adding an accessory i'm like yes i already have 12 volt right there and all i have to do is run a short wire to add that secondary accessory if you're thinking about purchasing this product or any product on mobilemuffstab.com we highly recommend that you check out our membership programs

{"id": "POIw4qEitl8", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "f_L4wqr64iNW3GStaF_OouSUI-E", "transcript": "hey guys eric from mobilemusthave.com here and today we are going to show you the new parsec falcon mobile antenna for mobile routers [Music] all right thanks so much for joining us guys uh this antenna is actually we're very excited about it because we've had customers for a very long time asking us if there's anything they can do to get some additional cellular signal strength when they're a bit further away from cell towers without having to drill a hole up in their roof or to run wires if they're in a marine application and the answer is yes you can do something about that using this new parsec falcon portable antenna now the parsic falcon has actually been on their website for a little while and they did sort of a pre-launch for it a while back but we found that it wasn't really in the channel and it wasn't available in very many locations so we reached out to the folks at parsec we talked to them about the fact that we thought this would be a popular unit for our customers and they made sure to get some available for us so to give you kind of a quick overview here this is a 2x2 mimo antenna meaning that it has two cellular elements or cellular antennas inside this case here this is about seven inches from top to bottom and about six inches left to right so it's pretty portable and on the back side here you've got some mounting options it comes with these foldable here legs that allow it for to basically be used for a tabletop installation but then it also includes a suction cup mount as well as a wall anchor and screw mount for a more permanent installation on a wall or something that's not glass we find the suction mount option is a great one for mobile use you can install this suction cup right up into here and then this antenna can essentially mount right up in a window in the rv or in the boat or marine application giving you an antenna that is going to suffer a lot less from interference if this were like mounted behind a wall in your mobile application because this is a 2x2 mimo cellular device meaning it has those two cellular antennas this single antenna kit is going to work for category 4 category 6 category 7 category 12 devices so anything that uses two cellular antenna connectors is going to work with one antenna if you have a dual modem device like our transit pro that may have dual category 12s or a combination of 7 and 12 where you have two modems you can pick up two of these and you can mount them next to each other the manufacturer recommends four inches or more of distance apart so that they perform and don't interfere with each other but it's absolutely possible if you have a 5g device or a category 20 device which is the top of 4g before 5g came out then those will use four cellular antennas or 4x4 mimo so you'll also want to get two of these for those applications as well now you could in theory take two of the small antennas and connect them to two antenna ports and then use this for the other two that would likely work you don't necessarily have to get two of these although they're pretty inexpensive if you look at the listing page sub 100 so for the performance that they give if you're not interested in looking at the roof antenna which will give you even more performance this is a great option to get two of these but you can mix and match if you wanted to add two stubbies and two of these to get yourself a little added benefit at least for the two that were using this antenna just remember never leave cellular antenna ports open with nothing on them that can cause a lot of problems with your connectivity so always connect an antenna of some sort to those cellular antenna ports and those wi-fi ports the cable that they've included here is called an lsr 200 cable and and that's a very heavy duty cable um for such a short uh amount of cable six feet but it's still very flexible like i said before and that's going to seriously help this antenna be a top performer in tor in terms of performance you typically see this is a pep a pep link pep wave antenna that comes with uh just about all of our popular mobile routers and this is a two decibel gain antenna meaning you'll you'll do quite a bit better than like a cell phone with that right out of the box with the two decibel gain uh this antenna is a four decibel gain antenna and for every two i think it's like two and a half uh db of gain you're looking at 100 percent more sell signal because of how cell signal is measured exponentially so what you you're really looking at is a hundred percent signal improvement with a product like this now in our real world testing having this mounted directly on a pep wave device with just kind of your local stubble stubby antennas inside maybe away from a window a little bit a pep wave device uh will do pretty well as long as it's got relatively decent cell signal and even with these antennas we will see folks pick up decent signal when a cell phone is barely picking up any so two decibels does make a big difference along with the fact that there's a little bit more power in the pep wave device because it's direct wired uh to your power source but in real world applications when we apply this located near a window we're typically seeing six seven decibels of gain improvement some of that's because of the antenna and some of it's because we're getting closer to the outside by mounting this up against a window but that's a major improvement 200 plus by using something like this and you don't really have to install it it's a window mount application the falcon comes in two kind of flavors currently from a cable perspective the one i'm holding here is your sma cables they look like very small cable tv connectors with a small center pin in the middle there and this is the connector for the cellular side of peplink devices just about all of the mobile routers we sell the only exception would be the mbx line which is our enterprise line which uses a qma connector but we do have adapters if that was something you were interested in looking at the second type that you can get is called a ts9 connector and you'll see these right here we'll give you a close-up of those as well ts9 connectors are popular in mobile hotspots quite a bit of mobile hotspots use these verizon 8800 the netgear nighthawk all the way up pretty much all the versions will use that ts9 connector so you've got a couple different flavors in terms of connectors that you can use as of july 2022 if you do pick up the ts9 variant of this it will come with an additional accessory to what we've talked about already and that is that it will come with this which is a small little case for a netgear nighthawk router you can also put another hotspot in there typically or possibly i shouldn't say typically if it'll fit in there and it just gives you a way to have this device also window or glass mounted or wall mounted to kind of clean up the installation application if you're using with this with a netgear nighthawk that isn't going to work for everybody but it is a nice touch and they don't charge very much more in the ts9 bundle to give you this option parsec has given us word just as of yesterday and we said oh we're filming the video right now that they are looking to change up how this works from a ts9 and sma connector perspective in the coming months could be uh q4 could be a little bit earlier of 2022 but again just look at the description and we'll update that if they change anything related to what ships in the box uh again though pep wave devices you're going to want sma connectivity and mobile hotspot devices typically will be ts9 connectivity but check your mobile hotspots connectors there are some other ones out there we've seen but the vast majority are going to use ts9 connectors so in closing the parsec falcon antenna is going to give you a decent amount of additional cellular coverage if you mount this up in a window compared to those small stubby antennas now word to the wise folks if you are looking to do a permanent rv or marine installation we do recommend you go with a permanently installed antenna when you get into some of those larger antennas like the parsec husky or the belgian shepherd or some of those large high performance antennas because they're mounted up on the roof up outside nice and high up so they can see the cell tower and because they're larger and have larger antenna elements inside to pick up the signal they can do even better than these but this is portable and very easy to use so like most things smaller uh is going to give you less performance smallest least performance this is better roof antenna would be best the parsek falcon is a 600 megahertz to 6 gigahertz antenna or a 6 to 6 antenna so you are going to get the benefit of 5g support and 600 megahertz all the way down to 600 megahertz so this is going to support all of the cellular spectrums if you're thinking about purchasing this product or any product on mobilemusthave.com we highly

{"id": "a2lLAZNhFsQ", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "8tNKKuxvGj0-9jq_6Vs5h4Od9rQ", "transcript": "hey guys eric from mobilemustav.com and today we've got a really cool unique product from parsec inside of this little tube is a 20 inch by 20 inch antenna ground plane that gives us a lot of installation flexibility for mobile users come along with us and we'll tell you all about it [Music] yeah so when we were down in plano texas talking to the team at parsec we were spending a lot of time talking about ground planes and what a ground plane does you know kind of at the simplest level is it's it's a piece of metal usually you know conductive metal typically aluminum or steel that is mounted underneath the antenna flat horizontally extending past the antenna when you look at spec sheets on antennas you're going to typically see in fine print these max gain specifications include the use of a ground plane usually a rather large ground plane 20 or 24 by 24 but sourcing a piece of metal that large and also getting it to fit if there are any issues on your roof or possibly a slight amount of curve on the roof can be problematic this is what parsec has come up with and we're here to tell you all about it so getting back to the basics of ground planes that metal ground plane that's going to be mounted horizontally underneath that roof antenna i've got one here as an example here's a parsec husky which is a very popular high performance antenna it doesn't necessarily need a ground plane but if you use one it will improve the performance a bit on the antenna now a ground plane will mount underneath this antenna if this antenna was mounted on your roof like this the ground plane would be right below it and when the cellular signals kind of bounce across the earth they would hit that ground plane and bounce into the antenna and that ground plane will improve the antenna's ability to pick up and also transmit that cellular signal now if you have a vehicle roof that has a metal roof you've got a ground plane already built into your roof your roof is the ground plane because it's made of metal so you're covered but if you're like me and you're in an rv or if you're looking at a marine application or anything where you're really looking at kind of mounting this on plastic or on fiberglass it's going to be really tough for you to you know use the roof as a ground plane because it's not made out of the right material now what you have here as i kind of get this all rolled out is a 20 inch by 20 inch piece of aluminum that has ultra high strength 3m like adhesive on the back of it that can get you secured up to your roof by keeping this ultra ultra thin we can ship it in very small tubes it's kind of cost prohibitive and very difficult to ship something 20 inches wide without making the cost really out of control so by making it ultra thin and being able to be rolled up it keeps the cost of this down but it also means that it's really big so it's going to have a lot of performance characteristics or benefits in what it can do this product can be cut with a standard pair of scissors you could obviously use metal shears if you want but it's like a really really thick tin foil but it will stand up to the outdoors and to the elements what you're going to want to do to get this installed is take a really really good cleaner to the roof mineral spirits often is really good for most rvs but if you have a tpo rubber roof or something else just go ahead and you know do a google search and look for a good way to clean that roof off um typically something like this is going to adhere best to a roof that's got a very very smooth surface allowing that adhesive adhesive properties to stick but we have seen it work on rubber roofs as well and we'll tell you a little bit about how we get them to perform optimally once you've got this sort of fit on the roof and you know where you're going to put it you've got this marked out on the roof i'd actually put this aside and double check where that antenna is going to be mounted we have a number of different installation videos with antennas that give you an idea of the best way to install a roof antenna make sure you're really careful with where you're drilling and that you're not drilling through any ac ducts or electrical wiring because that can cause all sorts of problems we typically recommend you get a long drill bit with like a 3 8 inch nice and small drill bit and drill a pilot hole to make sure you're not hitting anything and if you did hit something lightly you could die core up that hole and try elsewhere and then also you know we show this in the videos a lot but just make sure you're not drilling through any of the joists or the studs or the aluminum bracing that's in that roof and you can typically see that we'll link below one of the last installation videos i did in a travel trailer that can show you kind of a good way to understand what you're going through and picking an optimal spot so once you're there i recommend that you go ahead and drill the larger size hole that's going to be ready for the antenna and once you've drilled that through the top of the roof and then also drilled through on the bottom of the roof uh you're pretty much ready to now apply the ground plane all right so let's talk about installation kind of best practices for this product we've got one of these installed on a trailer that's been in use for six plus months with no issues using the methodology but it's really all about prep you want to make sure you prep that roof get it super clean to make sure that you have an optimal installation experience and no water gets underneath this that could compromise that adhesive that you've got holding down this ground plant so make sure you go ahead like we said before clean that roof as well as possible with mineral spirits you can also finish it off with a little bit of rubbing alcohol and once it's dried off go ahead and make sure that this fits exactly where you like it on the roof and you kind of set this aside don't cut that yet we want to make sure that we go ahead and do a test pilot hole through the roof making sure we didn't hit anything in the roof and then go ahead and drill out the larger hole depending on the antenna you have as your finish hole both from the top and the bottom we have a video on installing pep wave antennas and we've also done a couple with pointing and with parsec they're all pretty much the same so this installation method is going to use that same method we're not using the locking nut um but there's this couple different things so we're going to drill that hole through the roof like you see in those videos and then we're going to come back to this now you can measure through here to find your center point on this pretty easily if you just measure and pop a little pinhole there and then before you put this down go ahead and flip this over after again your roof is clean and remove that adhesive now i recommend that you have the ground plane set up in this configuration sort of like a taco now you'll have that small hole in the middle and you can go ahead and line that up with the hole on your roof and drop that right in the center on top just in the center there and then you want to press up and out from that now we've had some customers use literally baking rolling pins and in testing and they've been really really happy with the results so that's an option or you can pick up a a small roller that's designed for rolling out like automotive headliner and stuff like that at a big box store typically you don't really need it though um you know we can you can just really install this honestly just with with your hands if necessary so go ahead and go center and then just nice and gentle go ahead and apply all across and down to get that nice and flat and then go ahead and do the other side and that will be adhered to the roof next you want to take that pin hole you can take a razor blade and just cut like a pie like a pizza in four different directions and then fold down the remaining sections into the hole and then you can take your antenna rout the wires through that hole just like you see on all the other antenna installation videos because this is already done and below it you're going to basically follow all the steps you see in those videos so you fold that down go ahead and put that antenna down and finish up your configure your connections and whatnot now before you leave the roof you're going to want to take for best practices a bead of dye core self-leveling sealant and go ahead and trace the edges here of this ground plane the ground plane will still functionally operate with the dicor it'll it'll uh just waterproof it so that no water can get underneath the ground plane and compromise the adhesive once the antenna has put been put down it will stick to the ground plane the ground plane is sticking to the roof so you're covered there and then we just want to dicor around the antenna one last time to make sure no water can get into the adhesive on the bottom of the antenna and that's pretty much it if you did have to cut a corner off or something like that again it'll still work just make sure you die core all of the edges of the ground plane and you should be good to go one note you know this is pretty pretty resilient stuff but you just don't really want to necessarily walk on it a bunch or do anything that might create a rip in this that could potentially get water into it if something happens and you get a little pinhole or something occurs just drop a little bead of dicor over that and that'll seal that right up and the ground plane will still work fine so it's okay since we're all about tips and tricks hey if you have to return this for some reason and it's unused or you obviously can't return it if it's been used but you can go ahead and use this tube to go ahead and roll this right back up there we go nice and perfect go ahead and slide that out and then you can just rotate from the inside outside here a little bit to kind of just tighten that up so that it's getting smaller smaller smaller smaller smaller smaller there we go and you can just slide it right back into the tube using a count a clockwise motion for me because of the direction i put it in and get that right back into the tube uh so that's a good way to get it back in there for some reason you have to get that back to us if you're thinking about

{"id": "G5nUE4oXk_0", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "pHSF-xlg_I5TVqfpEJxjEwefhwk", "transcript": "hi guys this is andy and eric from mobile must have and in this video we're going to go over the parsec husky antenna [Music] well she is [Laughter] husky at parsec they actually nicknamed this the birthday cake uh that's the magnet version but these antennas are kind of big um but what comes with additional size is additional performance in many cases so anything better yeah this has been one of our top performing antennas this is what is bundled in our ultimate road warrior plus and speed demon plus bundles so this has definitely been a high performance antenna that's also used by california highway patrol and a bunch of other first responder folks so this has got a lot of battle testing uh under its belt uh today's just an overview video so we're gonna tell you a little bit about the variants and some of the features yeah now we've actually been selling these for a couple months already and have been really really happy with their performance overall um so although this video is new the product definitely is not for us which i'm so excited about getting the video out uh a keynote too these antennas also are 5g ready and they cover the 600 megahertz range which is that t-mobile band 71. so they're a great option for any future proofing or if you're looking at 5g in the next couple months or years to come these are a great thing you can purchase now and you won't need to reinstall a new antenna later from a variance standpoint they obviously come in two different colors there are two main cable lengths we have a seven foot option and a 15 foot option and we have different mounting options you can get it with just kind of the stock um flat surface mount option or you can get it with the magnum out option i'm gonna say this clearly though there are different skews you can't necessarily switch a magnet and that and it just so kind of plan ahead which one you want to go with watch this video we'll try and help you solve that too yeah if you're absolutely not sure you could i would recommend go with the magnet because there is a kit called the hardware kit that will let you step down into the standard but you can't step up into the magnets so just keep that in mind because it's not a part we can buy from the manufacturer just this foot base right but to give you kind of a high level on the antenna itself we've got a 3m adhesive mount here check out our mounting kind of options discussion video here that kind of goes more into this but this can be mounted on top of a box to give you some additional height if you've got some rails you've got to cover or directly onto the roof this antenna does not require a ground plane you can add one if you want but the manufacturer is comfortable saying that the performance specs they've outlined are good based on this just being mounted straight on a non-metal surface one additional note you'll see this locking nut here that is for if you're installing on a metal roof but if you're in an rv installation you can disregard that locking nut and we cover a lot more of what that means in that installation video we referenced earlier if you upgrade or move to the magnet mount another feature that's very beneficial for some of our customers is that these magnets besides being insanely strong um we kind of have had some of our customers laugh and say that uh it's um it's hard to get a wall it's really hard to get them off these are adjustable so you can unscrew that very similar to like a table leg if you've got a ridged roof and that will help you level out that antenna the other thing what's great about the magnet mounts is while this antenna goes kind of straight down to wherever you're mounting it on the roof the magnet has a side exit option so while you could go straight down and then deal with ceiling this one's really more designed for some sort of exit that's not below the antenna so you could do this for a couple different reasons if you needed to if you already had a solar drop and you wanted to run cables through that since you already had a good hole for the roof this is a good option then you just need to put down like a metal sheet and then magnet this to it you don't have to do any other holes or any other cable drops this is where that kind of option sticks out yeah that's really popular for folks that have those railroad rails on like gerard awnings because they can actually run these cables through the front cap or through the rear cap rather than through the roof and that can give you some ease of installation by getting to certain cabinets right above the driver's seat area i know for us we see that a lot with the integra coaches that's very popular well and i have um this magnet on my rv i have a solar drop so i didn't need to run another hole with another cables and deal with it i just wanted to run it off at the same place so i put a magnet sheet down i just attached this with the magnets and then could run the cables exactly where i wanted them to go yep in terms of kind of what's inside the under the hood here uh these come in seven we kind of stock two variants of this a seven and one antenna which is a four by four mimo cellular a2 wi-fi element and a gps element that's kind of our most popular we also stock it in the nine in one variant which steps it up to getting four by four on the wi-fi typically not needed if you're looking at any of our peplink modems but we have had certain customers that are running rallies or they want to add a second pair of wi-fi on the roof for like public wi-fi food trucks first responders i need more wi-fi throughput it is an option the housing doesn't change you just add two more leads uh and then finally just one other option that these antennas have this is an additional option you can purchase this would be a pole mount solution for it this would be much more for like a rural home not necessarily for an rv usage as dealing with poles it's not something we typically recommend it's also just a really heavy antenna and this is heavy alone and it's a nice high quality piece of metal but you've got the mounting brackets to a pole that goes on this tennis sticks on top it's a great option it also will double as a wall mount so you can install this and just screw it straight to a wall rather than needing a pole if that's an install use case for you so now if you are looking for maybe like a five in one version of a parsec uh eric can you grab that one yeah this is our doverman um so the doverman is just a smaller profile this is a five in one antenna uh this does they do recommend you use a ground plane with this antenna which we sell we've got a 16 inch round that we've tested that's had pretty good luck with it and you know you just if you're gonna go with a five and one for like an mk2 or a category six or single category 12 modem you really just don't need all of this space so doe room is a nice option if you want a smaller install footprint but there's nothing that will prevent you from installing a seven in one you'll just have two extra cell leads that you can use in the future future proof if you want to upgrade your modem if you're looking for a custom cable length or something custom for a fleet or you're doing some type of commercial rollout we do offer custom solutions there are some quantity kind of minimums typically five antennas or more but that is an option if you need something specific we're very close uh and one of the top partners with parsec so we can get you whatever you need all right guys well if you have any questions on these antennas you can leave a comment below or chat with us on our website you can also shoot us an email at info mobile must have dot com and we're happy to get back to you alright guys i hope to see you on the road thanks guys bye [Music] you", "snippet": {"publishedAt":

{"id": "d4wee1Qd7bU", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "Kzh0WCtbPMZ-vcjrmlMGU4Pm1sQ", "transcript": "one hey guys eric from mobilemusthave.com here and today we've got this nifty little dc powered five port poe power over ethernet network switch that's awesome for mobile use come along with us and we'll tell you all about it [Music] so for quite a while now we've had actually an eight port version of this big boy here which actually is pretty small considering it has an integrated power supply that will take 12 volts up to the 48 volts needed for power over ethernet on our store 8 port with some fiber connections as well so that's a great option if you need a lot more power that's like 150 plus watts of power but for smaller installations and if you just don't need that many ports or if you just want to save a little bit of money we have this five port variant here uh which is a great little uh network switch so if you go to you know pick up a standard switch from you know staples or best buy or whatever those are gonna require a 120 volt power basically they use standard ac power because most people use them in homes now most of those little adapter bricks that come with those switches actually are bringing the power down to 12 volts they do technically run on 12 volts however they don't put out poe or power over ethernet meaning that you can power devices like security cameras or usually wireless access points small little access points via that single ethernet cable so what makes this device unique is that you can go ahead and wire 12 up to 48 volts dc direct wiring in to this removable uh power input right here and then that will hi to the warehouse dogs that will enable the uh poe or power over ethernet ports on this device now this device has five gigabit ethernet ports here typically four are usable because one of them you're going to uplink to your mobile router or mobile internet setup and that gives you four available ports now the little converter inside here that takes the 12 volts up to 48 volts will provide up to 60 watts of power at 12 volts now you may be thinking well if that's 150 plus 160 is 60 going to be enough well a average access point from pep link say like an ap one mini will use 12 watts so 12 24 36 you're fine to go ahead and wire up uh quite a few access points and this will run you can also get up to 120 watts out of this device if you need to you just have to step up the input power to 24 uh basically 24 to 48 volts but most people are going to run on 12 volts so this is really going to put out a max of 60 watts but 60 watts so that's a lot of power from an access point perspective the mini puts out about 12 watts if you're stepping up to a wi-fi six access point uh like the apa x lite which is a great access point that maxes out at 15 watts so you're more than covered with that 60. and if you're going with a big boy the apa x which is really an enterprise access point it's not really made for mobile use but it puts out a lot of power for very distant if you want a lot of range go with the apa-x that'll use about 20 watts of power 22 watts i think max of power so your 60 is still going to cover you for those applications you've got a nice ruggedized aluminum enclosure here so this thing is really kind of built to be industrial grade on the back here we actually have a din rail mount that's pre-installed on the device if you don't know what din rails are you can actually just pick up din rails anywhere they're basically just little strips of metal that can be screwed into you know machinery cabinets or you could just screw them directly to the wall and then devices will just clip right on to the din rail it allows you to put a lot of devices next to each other uh and keep them very organized but if you're not going to mess around with din rails they do include a little l bracket here that you can simply install in place of that din rail to get you a standard wall mount that you can just go ahead and screw right to the wall a common question we get about poe switches is what happens if i plug a device in that doesn't need power am i going to damage it the answer is no poe is a smart technology that operates and it knows based on communication between the devices whether or not it should or should not inject power into the device so if you plug in regular desktop computers or other peripherals to give them network access to your network and they don't need poe it will simply be disabled and it won't take away from the 60 watts of total power you have available in the switch this switch is an unmanaged switch it's sort of a standard switch you're not going to be able to set up vlans or other things although you can do that on pep wave devices and you could add multiple switches based on the number of lan ports if you wanted to set up vlans but this is an unmanaged switch and the price reflects that which is nice it's really just designed to help you uplink additional wired devices they've given us two little status lights over here as well as an instruction booklet inside of the box that gives you an idea of what they uh do mostly it's when it's powering on if it's trying to negotiate uh whether or not to provide power over ethernet and then you've obviously got status lights on each of the ports as well to tell you that there is a connection to your other device and that traffic is passing for a complete list of specifications on this device go ahead and hop over to the listing page which will be in the description of this video and click

{"id": "xeQyq4V258o", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "EE6dLtWn8fSbd6FQXbwCdeQZgB8", "transcript": "hi this is eric with mobilemusthav.com and new for 2022 we've got the brand new balance 20x that now has an integrated category 7 cellular modem come along with us and we'll tell you all about it [Music] so this balance 20x is not necessarily designed for mobile use but a lot of our customers do use it for mobile connectivity because it has a lot of features that some of our other devices do not have that are made for mobile use i think it was about two years ago when the balance 20x came out and when we started getting wind about it we were super excited because it had a couple things that a lot of devices at similar price points simply didn't have this was basically a sub 600 device and it had a lot of cool stuff mainly it had an integrated switch so we had access to wire up additional wire devices it had a usb wan port here on this side so we could add additional cellular devices in addition to the one that's built into it and then it had a mini flex port here to add additional expansion capabilities all in a device that was really inexpensive you know sub 500 when it came out we were super excited and the kind of one lacking thing that kind of bummed us out was that they launched this with an embedded that you kind of see at the bottom here there's sim card slots right there a category 4 cellular router and for those of you guys who kind of follow how the technology works category 4 was basically your iphone from 2007 that was launched like right when steve jobs was there saying welcome to the new iphone that was the category 4 cellular router so when we saw that we were like oh it has such potential but we really want to see that integrated mobile modem inside the device you know step it up so that we could use it for mobile connectivity they've delivered with this new category 7 variant so before we get into the walk around and kind of what's going on let me tell you a little bit about category seven so category four has like four cellular bands i think maybe five sorry if i'm wrong you could check the spec sheet on the original balance 20x we'll put a link to the the original and the category 7 down below but very very limited just basically the primary cellular bands with category 4. when you get into category 6 you started to see a lot more bands but category 7 is really what rounds out now for 2022 this device to really connect to just about any of the major cellular networks and really perform in addition to all the primary expansions that you would have gotten with a category 6 category 7 steps it up and gives you access to three bands that really matter right now as these cellular companies are buying up additional cellular spectrum to improve their coverage and their performance the first band that i want to tell you about in that category 7 is band 14. band 14 is a t's firstnet first responder band they through a partnership or through a contract with the government were able to roll out a 700 600 to 700 megahertz rural cellular band that gives them a lot of broad broad broad coverage it's reserved for first responder priority use but when first responders aren't using band 14 you can use it as an att customer as they open it up to the public so it is something that it is responsible for a lot of the rural coverage you see on a t coverage maps so prior with that category 4 embedded device your invited modem you weren't able to get access to band 14. category 7 in addition to giving you first net band 14 gives you two other bands that we want to kind of highlight there are additional ones but the two big ones we want to talk about are band 66 and band 71. those two bands are a big deal if you're a t-mobile customer uh a lot of t-mobile's rural network runs on band 71 it's a low frequency band that travels very very far and if you're looking at that coverage map and it says you should have signal but you were in a category 6 or category 4 device modem prior and you didn't get any signal it's most likely because that coverage in that area was provided on band 71 band 66 is a higher frequency band it has a lot more bandwidth and it's a band that's kind of essentially it's one of the backbone you know bands for t-mobile it's a very important band so you want to make sure you have if you're thinking about t-mobile you might be looking at like our p-800 plan on our website or one of our other t-mobile plans those those band 66 and 71 for t-mobile are really important and they are included now in that category 7 modem doing a quick overview of what's included in the box we've obviously got the balance 20x we have an ac adapter here with a 2.1 millimeter barrel connector on it we've got two wi-fi antennas and two cellular antennas we've also got a gps antenna here with a six foot lead a little quick start guide that tells you about kind of how to hook up the antennas and how to get initially into the management console and then a little bit of wire management tape uh the instructions that come in this box are highly limited there is a detailed instruction guide you can get on peplink's website but for most of our customers as soon as you purchase we'll send you a link to quick start guides on how to get all of this set up and up and running you can also look at those guys at guides.mobilemusthave.com all right so let's take a look at the device itself we have a wan port so we have the ability to wire in an external uh internet source this is very common for customers to wire in starlink or cable modem if they have that or something else for wired internet access that lan port is key we've got our four lan ports here uh lan meaning for local devices and the balance 20x is one of the first devices that has the ability to actually unlock one of these lan ports as a second additional wired lan port using the optional lan port license so it's a lot of flexibility in terms of what you can do with these ports um but there are some licensing fees to unlock some of those additional features we've got dual band wi-fi here so this is 2 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz wi-fi that will transmit the wireless to your local devices same as the original balance 20x and then we've got our gps port there's four small screws here that cover the flex module or mini flex module slot uh right here i've got a this is a 5g one actually i believe a little flex module as you can see here and that would slide right into the device in this blank slot and give you a second uh cellular modem so even though you've got that category seven in there this would give you the ability to expand and add a 5g cellular modem or a category 20 category 6 category 12 really based on your budget and what you want to do there's a bunch of flex modules that you can add which will give you the integrated two cellular modems in this device because this is a prime care device that means it includes speed fusion so if you are going to add a flex adapter like that you can bond the integrated cellular you can bond the flex module and if you want to add a third cellular option via usb this is a max adapter this is a category 12 but they make these up to 5g you can integrate that via this usb port so for that that really inexpensive price point kind of sub 600 you could have three cellular connections and sd-wan bonding to bond those connections together all with this tiny little device it's got a ton of expandability looking at the other side of the device for a second i'm getting a little carried away with everything i got on the desk over here we've got our two cellular antenna ports for that category 7 embedded modem and then that usb port we've also got a status wi-fi and cellular light for our customers cellular will be solid green and that's going to be the embedded one if you get a flex module they actually will include their own lights on the flex module so you can see both modems and kind of what's going on but status will be solid green if the device is on it'll be blinking green if it's booting up or if it's doing a firmware update or it'll be solid red if it's like in the very initial part of boot or if there's a problem it'll be solid red wi-fi will be on if your wireless is transmitting locally and then your cellular like i said before will be solid green if you're connected to cellular or blinking green if it's trying to connect to the cellular network one thing to note the balance 20x does not have wi-fi wan meaning you cannot connect to an external like campground wi-fi as an internet source they really didn't build that into the balance products these were sort of initially made for small office branch office connectivity where you'd plug a cable modem into one of these and then you'd have all the cellular redundancy to ensure you always stayed connected for us actually in our some of our corporate headquarter offices including here we actually do use these balance 20xs for our offices it's great when our cable modem goes down we can still access via the cellular so it is it is not necessarily just for mobile use if you're looking for a really really solid device that can do site-to-site connectivity with like a headquarters or a secondary office or different offices we use these all the time and the to site connectivity to connect multiple locations is so easy to set up it's just a couple clicks it's really what makes pep link pep wave products uh you know stand out in my opinion for a complete list of specifications on the balance 20x go ahead and hop over to the listing page which will be linked in the description of this video and click on the documentation tab and that will bring you to a full

{"id": "WHK4QfYoEAU", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "_OyuAfFQZn8ylDoljxXcbMxjf0k", "transcript": "hi this is eric with mobilemusthave.com peplink has released their new max br1 mini now with a category 7 modem this is a serious upgrade in our entry level products come along with us and we'll tell you all about it [Music] so we actually did a video a few months back on the pepwave max br1 mini hardware version 3. and it's a great device and it basically the big difference that they brought into this generation device is they upgraded the processor and the memory inside of this device and they also gave it dual band wireless technology so it supports two gigahertz and five gigahertz right out of the box the previous generation mini only had 2 gigahertz wi-fi that added processor bumped this guy up to 300 megabits of max router throughput so that was a big significant change in this hardware version 3. this router in the category 6 variant became the replacement for this device which was the max br1 mk2 which has since been discontinued now for customers that had the max br1 mk2 there wasn't really a lot of reason to look at the mini hardware version 3 because they were both category 6 modems you didn't really get a lot other than that increased router throughput but since you were operating on a category 6 modem they were going to perform pretty similarly so we didn't recommend customers that had existing devices to look at upgrading those at that time so we've been spending a lot of time with peplink and their engineering team and we've been talking to them about the fact that the category 6 modems and the category 4 modems we don't really even sell the category 4 modems except for to our enterprise customers for kind of low end machine to machine communication stuff which is great it works really well for atms and stuff like that but for our entry-level customers that we've been recommending the category 6 modem for pretty much the inception since like 2017 or 18 when we started our business as technology has improved and things have changed on the cellular networks however specifically at t and t-mobile have brokered deals where they have access to different channels or bans on the cellular networks the category six started to have uh certain gaps in coverage that we wanted peplink to address through those conversations we talked to them about improving their entry level product line to get us a category seven modem that addresses a lot of those shortcomings of the category six before we get into the specific band information the difference between category six and category seven category seven has some additional uh carrier aggregation abilities that give it uh really the download speed max download speed is actually the same it's 300 megabits but on the upload side it goes from 50 megabits all the way up to 150 megabits with category 7. so you get significant improvement on the upload side and there are some other benefits on the download side as well the big improvements with category 7 if you're here in the united states is that it includes coverage for band 14. now that's att's first net rural band that's a band that's reserved for first responders when they need it but when they're not using it it can be used by the public now band 14 runs at a low frequency around 700 megahertz so it travels really really far so it does kind of make up a lot of the coverage map that you see in fringe areas for a t so that category seven adding batten 14 for a t is a big deal in addition to att category 7 modems are greatly improving the ability to connect to t-mobile's network t-mobile has two bands that it uses quite extensively in its rollout one is band 66 and one is band 71 band 66 kind of rounds out a lot of their general kind of bandwidth capacity uh in their in their kind of new nationwide network and band 71 is their rural band so that's where we've got the 600 to 700 megahertz range um frequency for that ultra far distance ability so if you're looking at t-mobile or maybe you previously looked at a data plan with us like our p800 plan on t-mobile and you were using it in a category six device which will work you might have had some coverage gaps where you felt like t-mobile just shouldn't really have the coverage that they said they did on their website a good part of the reason for that was likely because you didn't have access to band 66 or band 71. category 7 gets you that so it's going to give you a lot of improved coverage for verizon customers category 6 and 7 you had most of the band coverage for verizon already so you might not necessarily see some coverage improvements but you will take advantage of some of that increased throughput through the carrier aggregation improvements that the modem offers this category 7 hardware version 3 mini device is going to become the product that is bundled with our full timer bundle its designation will be the full timer vr3 or version 3 and we expect this modem to be around for quite a while because it just rounds out everything at such an aggressive price point peplink has brought the mini into the prime care lineup which means that it is a prime care device and for customers that don't need access to a wired wan port and don't need access to a wi-fi wan to pick up campground wi-fi you can pick up this device at a lower price point or cost and then if you want to you can add the license to enable the lan port and the wi-fi wan at a later date if you look at the listing page and you look at checkout you'll see an advanced feature pack listed there and there are additional discounts if you bundle that feature pack at the time of purchase so it's definitely something i'd say it's probably worth getting at the time of checkout but if you really don't think you're ever going to use that wan port to plug in something like starlink you can do without it and if you don't think you're going to ever use campground wi-fi for your internet source you can do without it to save yourselves a few bucks quickly going over kind of what's in the box and then we'll give you an overview of the ports and what's going on in the device we've got our mobile router here we've got two wi-fi antennas we have two cellular antennas we have a ac adapter that comes with the four pin locking molex connector or mini molex connector that they have there we've got a quick start guide that they've improved for 2022 that includes pictures of the antenna ports to make sure you don't reverse up the antennas you've got a gps antenna here with the six foot cable attachment and then some wire management branded by peplink all included in the box looking at the device here for a second on the kind of port end not the antenna end here we've got two lan ports here that are for connecting wired devices a smart tv possibly a desktop computer or anything that you need wired lan access to and then we have a third lan port or wan port it is assignable assuming you have purchased the wan license so if you don't purchase the wan license this will just act as another third lan port so you can connect up to three devices locally moving on a little bit you've got three status lights we've got our status our wi-fi and our cellular for our customers who are new to pep wave cellular blinking green will mean it's trying to connect solid green will mean it's connected wi-fi will remain on meaning it's broadcasting local wireless inside the coach for your or your or boat for your local devices and then your status light will be red when it's booting up green solid when the unit is on and powered up or blinking green if it's booting up and powering up or if it's doing a firmware update it will also be blinking green so those status lights give you the ability to kind of know what's going on in the device without having to log into the management console and check everything out with a phone or a tablet or a pc moving on a little bit further we've got our our power port that four pin micro molex here and this device supports ignition sensing as well if you get the optional peplink branded cable ignition sensing is not typically needed for mobile installations like in an rv or marine application but if you're looking to install this in a vehicle like a first responder vehicle or something where you want the key position in the vehicle to change the behavior of the router for example turn the key off i want this to stay on for x number of minutes the ignition sensing feature does uh support it one note on ignition sensing is that advanced feature packet uh actually unlocks that feature as well so there's a couple other small things that are included in the feature pack but for most customers ignition sensing isn't something they they need to look to worry about as i mentioned it comes with an ac adapter that plugs in your standard ac power wall plug but on our listing pages we also have the optional dc direct wire kit that comes with a 3 amp fuse so you can wireless directly into your marine or coach battery house battery bank this unit will run on 12 or 24 volt systems so you don't have to just run it on 12 volt if you have a 24 volt battery bank you're fine and covered with that as well in rounding out the front here by those lights we also have our paper clip reset uh button there which if you look at the directions will tell you that if you hold it down for about 30 seconds it'll fully factory reset the device but you can actually use that to reset your admin password and your wi-fi passwords if you ever forget them without wiping out all your settings by just holding it for less than 10 seconds we have an article at support.mobilemustap.com that will explain how that reset button works flipping the device around for a second uh this is our antenna side and what we really like about this device which they've changed or upgraded from the mk2 is they've put all of our antenna ports on the same side a lot of our customers complained when they looked at roof antennas for these devices that had shrink wrap or heat shrink tape on them that they had to cut away some of the tape because the cables couldn't get to both sides and still look good it would kind of like you'd ever have to cut it away or the cables might end up like kind of bundling out here so it was a little bit difficult because they had connectors on both sides of the device so through through some feedback we kind of said hey like with the the br1 pro and most of the other devices can we get all these ports on one side and they were able to deliver for us which is great so we've got our two wi-fi uh dual channel wi-fi here that's the two gigahertz and the five gigahertz mimo 2x2 mimo wi-fi that's for the local device networks and we have our two cellular connections above that for our cellular category 7 modem with this and then our gps antenna in the middle and just a word of caution if you are looking at something like this make sure to always hook up the wi-fi and the cellular antennas we see a lot of customers call us and complain when they're first initially setting up the device and when we ask for pictures we get something back like this we're like where are the rest of the antennas oh i thought i only had to hook up one because i was just testing it no no no make sure you hook up all the antennas or the device is not going to work properly moving on right here there's a dust cover on this but right below here is the sim card slots now this is a single modem device but it has two sim card slots and new for 2022 they've upgraded to nano sim cards which are the smaller sims i'll show you a close-up here of how we insert and remove sim cards from this device they're spring-loaded slots and there are two of them and inside of the management console of the device you can switch between sim a and sim b if you've been fighting through mobile hotspots and powering them up and batteries bloating or having to reset them every single day and you're looking for something that's just a more reliable solution that can act a lot more like home internet this is a great device for you to consider looking at this is our entry level device we've included this in our full timer bundle as i said before and this is a really really solid device for folks that just want to stay connected to the internet don't want to think about it very much but also don't consider internet super mission critical if you're looking at mobile work or you just want absolute connectivity take a look at our speed demon bundle or our ultimate road warrior bundle which will include multiple cellular modems inside the device for additional redundancy but if this is something where you want to check email check facebook netflix and just you know the internet works and you do whatever you need to do this is an absolutely

{"id": "JtUztEjJ70c", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "i-F_9bJJxOE4rLGsmOrT3O7DYak", "transcript": "hi guys this is andy from mobile must have and in this video we're gonna go over the internet setup in eric's rv now this video was originally posted on his original blog channel livenlight.net but we decided to repost it here as it's extremely relevant content to what a lot of our followers are looking for and researching this video is also great as eric covers how he's expanded his pep wave to work with 5g modems as well as starlink and integrating kind of all the super popular and really the best options for mobile internet out there so you don't just have one thing you're relying on you're not just on cellular you're not just on campground wi-fi you're not just on on satellite as they all have their pros and cons this is a great way and he's gone over how he kind of links everything together to bring it all kind of into one solution all right so guys here you go here's eric we've been traveling on the road since 2015 and in those seven years we have been working from the road the entire time most folks know us as the founders of mobilemusthave.com an online retailer that specializes in mobile connectivity and it's been five years since i've done a video about our setup and what we use to stay connected on the road and let's just say lots of stuff has changed we use starlink as you can see here and we've built this nifty auto deploying antenna mask that we'll tell you about a little bit it's not something we sell but you can build one if you'd like with parts that you can get on the internet and we use a variety of other solutions to stay connected that are combined into a central dashboard that allow us to pick the best connection while we're traveling on the road come along with us and i'll tell you all about [Music] i look at three major things when i'm looking at designing a mobile internet solution and i kind of call them the three r's the first one is i'm looking for reliability a lot of people focus on speed when it comes to internet speed is very important but for me a reliable connection that is absolutely you know going to work for me in zoom calls and mobile work is is super important i'm also looking for reliable hardware and i want pieces of components that are built properly and built well with good software that runs them so i don't have to reboot them all the time or feel like i have to replace them every year reliability is my first r my second requirement is resiliency i want a solution that if it goes offline for any reason tends to be able to get itself back online without me having to intervene myself by rebooting the device i want something with some logic where if i go out of a cell coverage area for a bit while i'm driving when i get back into a coverage area it will connect back up and i don't have to do a lot of you know hands-on intervention to keep it going the third r is redundancy i want to know that i have more than one connection when i'm traveling on the road there's so many variables weather my physical location how many other rvers are in the area if there's a nascar event in the area who knows and all of those a solar storm we've had one of those that affected us there are so many variables that can can affect a connection so it's very important that we have multiple connections and a central command center that can control all of them that's our redundancy our third r and i hear my wife behind the camera giggling a little bit because she said what about the fourth r really easy to use and she's probably right when i'm not around to be a techie i need to know that this solution is going to allow her to do her job as well and she doesn't want to have to mess with it we want it to act as much like home internet as possible so with all of the current technology available starlink cellular free wi-fi those are kind of the big ones we see most people use which one is the best and what do you need to stay connected and we've said this multiple times in multiple training forums and quite a bit of videos unfortunately there is no single correct solution that will work for everyone and if you are moving around and you're mobile or if you just consider internet mission critical unfortunately it's typically not going to be one solution that's going to get you there it's going to be multiple connections to the internet and having the ability to connect to more than one depending on what your environment variables are in those locations or at that time of day now today is definitely a geek out session a bunch of the stuff i'm going to show you we don't sell and it's stuff that i've determined i want to have in my arsenal as someone who is in the business and needs to stay connected at all times the vast vast majority ninety percent of our customers aren't getting themselves involved in such a complex setup as what i'm going to show you today but 90 plus percent of our customers are using the central hub or command center that i'm going to show you downstairs to be the kind of hub or entry point into their mobile internet solution from there plenty of customers add on components and you know starlink being one but not everybody does and not everybody has to the solutions that we sell at mobilemusthave.com are very modular meaning that you can start out with one component and you can add to it as you learn more about what your internet requirements are and your needs are before i show you some of the components we have here on the roof and then we go down into the cabin and i show you how it's all connected together i kind of want to just cut to the chase and tell you what we are finding right now as of 2022 for our internet needs and what we're using the most we use our starlink internet solution as our kind of like primary internet solution about 20 of the time and people are oftentimes really surprised by that um the vast majority of the time when we do have issues now that they've enabled the roaming feature in starlink is related to us just not having enough sky for it to pick up enough satellites to retain and maintain a reliable connection a case in point or example right now we're at um the mobile must-have garage here in in the northeast and i'll just kind of show you panning up straight from the camera right here how much sky we have available it's a lot and then i'll pan over and show you the trees on this side and the roof over here we do not see a very reliable connection with our starlink at this location and because a lot of campgrounds are wooded or have trees or we like to park in shade we find that about four out of five times when we try to use this it's not functional now before when we didn't have it mounted up here we had the ability to run it around and we came with 75 feet of cable and that did help somewhat but campsites are not the largest and unless you want to go knocking on doors and asking people if you can put expensive equipment that people may want to take out in the driveway somewhere we thought this was the better solution and ultimately even when it was kind of mobile and we could move it around the yard we didn't find that it really improved our ability to use it that much so between it being kind of cumbersome and big and needing so much sky it's something we only use about 20 percent of the time so why bother with starlink well man when it works it's fast and it's awesome and it tends to work in the areas where we find cellular is struggling or having problems when we're like down on the colorado river you know down in arizona or on the kind of arizona california border where there's a lot of valleys and mountainous terrain on both sides and cell signals just can't penetrate those rocks this thing has saved our butts and kept us connected those are also the areas when we're really out in the middle of nowhere and there's we're not really fighting a lot of big elm trees in arizona so it's worked out really well for us um but again it's only about 20 of the time that we're using that solution about 10 of the time believe it or not we actually use wi-fi right now we're using wi-fi because our rfe is parked uh next to a a location or a garage that we have that has really good internet that we have wi-fi access to we don't tend to use wi-fi as much when we're in a campground although it has been something that has been really beneficial to us when we needed it in a pinch and the starlink wasn't able to get a signal so about 10 percent for what we call wi-fi as wan or the ability to connect to free public wi-fi or your home wi-fi and use that as your internet okay so that's 30 we have to get up to 100 so what do we use 70 of the time we use cellular internet for our connectivity what we like about cellular is that it doesn't require full access to the sky it works while we're driving and it tends to be pretty reliable and resilient especially when you have connections to more than one cellular carrier what can be challenging about cellular internet is that sometimes those cell towers are saturated um and there's a lot of people using them and they're not the fastest and also it can be difficult to get your hands on some high gigabyte data plans these days though so those are some downsides to cellular but between cellular wi-fi or wi-fi is wan meaning we can connect to an external wi-fi and use it in our rv and the starlink we've got a lot of different options to stay connected okay so starting here in the middle this big birthday cake looking thing is a big seven in one antenna and we've got it mounted here on a six inch tall box that gives us a bit of height to get over these awning rails on the top of this integra motor coach the reason why we want to get up above those rails it's not necessary especially if you're in kind of you know more kind of good cell cover areas but for us if we want to get out there these are made of metal and by getting up above them we get a clearer line of sight to the cell tower now that big antenna has four cellular antennas two wi-fi antennas so that's how we pick up our campground wi-fi and a gps antenna that allows us to see where our coach is on a map next of course we've got our starlink here uh we'll provide a link in kind of a brief description not only of a wiring diagram but also just sort of a component list of of how this all works it's pretty simple we have a linear actuating arm and then what's called a i think it's called a j mast or a j pole um that it's mounted to um that allows it to go up and down with the use of a linear actuator controller that runs all on 12 volts which we have running up through the front here uh into the front area just above the drivers area that allows us to put up and down the starlink via this little remote control which i'll show you here and it's very handy and allows us to not have to climb on the roof every time we want to use it over here you might notice a little kind of three antenna guy here that's a wineguard connect device that came with our rv that utilizes a category 4 cellular modem that's not the fastest solution out there anything you find at mobilemustav.com is typically a category 6 or better so this is actually not enabled on our rv but it did come with it so i wanted to explain what it is i almost forgot this little antenna over here is our cell booster we have a weboost drive cellular booster candidly we don't use that very much to connect to the internet it is um something that has gotten us out of a couple pinches but now that we have the starlink solution the booster when we're really far out from cellular just doesn't seem to be something we're using as much why do we still have it well it does work really well to help our phones inside the rv when we're on fringe cell service areas for voice calls um and sometimes when you just want a voice call that's not running over your wi-fi to work really well a booster can be a really great solution so if you want better cell signal service on your phone uh inside your rv that's a nice touch and it doesn't interfere with any of the other solutions so you can add it if you'd like that said on the cell booster side we do find that that birthday cake big seven and one parsec antenna just tends to outperform pretty consistently um the booster in terms of upload and download speed just about everywhere we are so we stick with that antenna okay so that's a lot of stuff how does it all connect it's a little bit easier if i show you that with some diagrams down below as well as show you what's going on inside the cabin so let's hop down and we'll get to that now before we head inside um i have a tendency to get a little too geeky sometimes so i did want to kind of preface and say to you guys that the basic solutions that we're going to be talking about today are essentially the bundle that we have at mobilemustav.com called the ultimate road warrior vr2 vr2 just stands for version two they've come out with a newer modem in 2022 that we'll talk to you about in the video but i'll kind of get into some geeky stuff and show you how it's all connected and don't get overwhelmed it is something that you could you know if you wanted to start with the core functionality of what i keep calling the mobile command center or the peplink mobile command center you would get the roof antenna the router and the 12 volt connection cable as well as the option to add high gigabyte cellular data plants all with that ultimate road warrior vr2 bundle so enough of that you can buy peppering products from other people not just us the video is really more designed to be a tour but i know this stuff can get overwhelming for folks so i want you to know that there is a bundle that gets you really started with just about all the basics that you're going to see today and then you can add on separate components as you see them as i talk about them so let's get started all right guys so welcome to the front of our integra motorhome and this is where most of the brains of our tech operation live as you can see here you can't really tell much of anything's going on we like our technology to be hidden and essentially we don't want to look at it but we do also want it to be very accessible we've accomplished both of both of those things here in this front installation now a lot of people ask us where the ideal place is to put your tech cabinet and you know obviously you don't really want to look at all those wires but you also want it to be functional and accessible so for us the front area was a really easy place to run wires from the roof because the integra coaches have an integrated roof cap which means that if you drill a hole in the front of the roof cap you're not actually drilling into the roof you're drilling into the cap which is a little bit safer from a waterproofing perspective and then the cap is actually hollow down to this cabinet in this corner so it's a very convenient way for us to get our wires in from the roof now the only downside to running stuff to the front here is that your wireless your local wi-fi network will typically be transmitting from here or from the antenna on the roof depending on how you configure your antenna cables we'll get into that stuff more later but for the most part this is a pretty long rv at 45 feet and if we're transmitting from inside our tech cabinet there we are okay and still receiving wi-fi in the back but we have added an additional access point back there just because we have a lot of devices we'll show you that in a little bit so inside this tech cabinet you might have been expecting a bunch of wires and stuff and it's really actually pretty empty as you can tell most of the stuff you see in here is actually our camera gear and our chargers for cameras our internet stuff is all mounted up above and we'll get into that in a minute before we talk about what these components are again a reminder we will put up a link to some wiring diagrams so you understand how all of this stuff is connected but a key thing to understand if you're thinking about a higher end mobile internet solution like this is to understand a term called wan source or what is when now wan stands for wide area network and to keep this really simple a wan source which is what we want to make sure you understand is an internet source and there are different flavors or types of wind sources that can exist in a mobile router or mobile command center there are three common wan source types in mobile routers or mobile command centers there's really kind of four but we're going to focus on three i'll tell you what the fourth one is last the first type of mobile wan source is a modem typically a cellular modem so that's something that takes a sim card from a cellular provider and gets you onto a cellular network so when source number one or kind of way to connect to the internet number one is a cellular modem many mobile routers or mobile command centers including the one we have here have more than one modem so those are multi-modem devices so they can accept multiple sim cards and connect to multiple cellular connections usually from more than one cell carrier at the same time so when type number one is cellular modem and you can have more than one cellular modem in certain devices the second type of wan source is an ethernet wan and it at the front of the mobile router we have here we have an ethernet port like a network cable port that's labeled wan and what that allows us to do is connect an external internet source to our router that it will use as internet and it will use that in addition to the onboard cellular so that gets us up to two when types or actually three wand sources because this device has two cellular modems so cell modem one saw modem two and then our ethernet wan port is our third connection to the internet the next type of win is something called wi-fi wan and that uses the wireless antennas on this mobile router to connect to external wireless networks like campground wi-fi or in the case for me here at the mobile must-have garage i can connect to the wi-fi broadcasting from our shop the mobile router we have here has two wi-fi wands built into it meaning it can connect to two different channels of wi-fi at the same time so for us we can connect to the two gigahertz longer range wi-fi that is available in our shop and the five gigahertz wi-fi available in our shop to give us two connections to the wi-fi at the same time so if you add that all up that's a lot of different connections to the internet i have my cellular modem one my cellular modem two my ethernet port which we'll talk about in a little bit what do you plug into that ethernet port my wi-fi when at two gigahertz and my wi-fi win at five gigahertz so i have five redundant connections to the internet with this mobile command center right out of the box that's a lot of redundancy now i promised you we'd talk about one additional type of wan source which i'm not using here which is a usb wan port now what a usb port does on certain select mobile routers is it allows you to tether a device like a mobile hotspot or in peplink's case they actually make small usb modems where you can add an additional connection via that usb port the model i'm going to show you today does not have a usb port but i did want to mention that is another type of wham so i know that was a lot to throw at you but the concept here remains the same like i said outside which is that our standard bundles at mobilemusthave.com specifically the ultimate road warrior bundle gives you that mobile command center or that center piece that can get you all of those options to connect to the internet now we're going to kind of talk about how you can configure those different wan sources to do different things like in the case for us right now we have it connected to starlink via that ethernet port before we get into the tour i do want to talk to you guys a little bit about a concept or a technical term called bonding and a concept or technical term called load balancing so we have all of those wan sources or internet connection sources at our fingertips with one of these command centers so we've got a lot of options to connect out to the internet now what a lot of people assume is that if you have five connections all connected to the internet all at once you're going to have this massive kind of perfect pipe to the internet that will work as one unified connection and this device can do that with a technology called speed fusion or speed fusion cloud which is a hosted product that peplink offers to combine all those connections but additional setup is required to get that working we have detailed guides on how to set up speed fusion cloud and these devices typically come with a license for speed fusion cloud that includes a terabyte of data which is a decent amount of data to get you up and running right out of the box with speed fusion now when you start to use bonding or connecting all of those connections together the technical way that works is you have to create a tunnel from your device to a data center and from that data center you go out to the internet and that's a vpn tunnel which peplink has branded speed fusion it takes literally about five minutes to set up speed fusion based on how easy peplink has made it through the interface it's not a big deal and we have detailed documentation on how to get that working but it's not for every single type of connection to the internet and i'll explain that now speed fusion is great for things like mobile work or connecting to voice over ip calls doing zoom calls or doing anything on the internet where you have a mission critical need to stay connected it can cause some problems with things like netflix or youtube tv or other streaming platforms because of that connection to the data center when you connect to the data center the traffic from like a netflix will show up as coming out of a data center in a different location than when you where you are now for companies like netflix they're legally bound to show you content based on your location and because of that if they detect that you're using speed fusion you may get an error saying hey please disable the vpn before you continue using netflix now that's not difficult to do it's covered in our guides on how to do it what we do for most of our customers and what i do for my setup is i have a network on my wi-fi that is configured to use speed fusion and then i have another network that's configured not to use speedfusion and for whatever devices i want to skip over the vpn connection and just use one of my wan connections they can connect to the other wi-fi network very easy just like anything else you just see two wi-fi networks and you connect to the one that you need to use based on the need okay so we've covered speed fusion or bonding now what if you don't set that up but you have five connections to the internet or five wan sources the router by default will use whatever is in the active priority on the dashboard and i'll show you some dashboard shots a little bit later and show you how the basics of this mobile router work and that'll kind of give you an idea of why we think it's such a great solution but keeping it high level if you have more than one connection or wan connection enabled at the same time the router will send traffic from say your desktop computer out one of the internet connections and say your tablet or your smartphone will go out a different connection and it will use whatever connections are available based on something called load balancing it's balancing the load of the internet across all the active connections the reason why that's important to understand is if you're just enabling five connections and say two of them are not very healthy like campground wi-fi maybe it's not very fast and you have them all enabled one out two out of every five times you go out to the internet it'll use those unhealthy connections and that can get really frustrating because you're like how come it's fast some of the time so load balancing is a really great feature but you have to educate yourself on what connections you have and if they're healthy or not you can do that very easily by running a speed test on a single connection by only enabling that one connection and then running a test to see if it's healthy or not and then simply disabling connections that are not fast enough for your needs the key here is that redundancy and that resiliency and that reliability right so we're talking about wow i have a lot of different ways to get connected to the internet i have a lot of tools at my disposal to make sure that i get connected but with something like this you also have to educate yourself and understand how these dashboards work and why certain connections may not be as fast as others so that you can pick the best solution to make sure you stay connected at each location now the good news is like i said up on the roof about 70 plus percent of the time i'm using my cellular connections as my default connection and this is a lot of the reason why if my cellular connection's working really well and i've got speed fusion enabled so they're connected and bonded as one single connection i don't really think about starlink very often it's there when i need it if my cell connections are not reliable and i can kind of see that i very likely have enough sky to get it up and working but it's not my primary connection so the good news is it's even though you have all this technology at your fingertips for the most part with our cellular modems enabled when we get to a location we find that the internet's working without us touching anything and it works pretty well but we do have those additional options to connect to wi-fi wan or to use our starlink if we need to on the front side here we see these ethernet ports that are both connected now one of those ethernet ports labeled wan like we talked about before we'll hop over to our starlink in the other cabinet which we'll show you in a minute the other port labeled lan or local area network is wired up to a network switch that's located in our central area that powers my desktop computer and other devices now for us we were actually able to utilize the factory wiring in the integra to connect all of the ethernet cables that were already pre-wired in the rv because we have touch screens and our net our coach was essentially already ethernet ready you can check with your manufacturer if that's something that you may be able to do as well as where the wiring locations are but if you don't want to mess with any of that you don't have to you can simply use the wireless network that is broadcasting from that mobile command center to power all of your devices you don't have to hardwire devices but if you can it's a nice touch it can be a little bit more reliable than relying on wireless only in this cabinet you may be asking yourself what the device behind our mobile router is that says pex m or pexim now that device is a sim injector and it is injecting sim cards meaning i can change out my sim cards inside my cab without having to go up on the roof now that's actually not in use right now because we've added the starlink the mobile command center we're featuring today like we said earlier has one ethernet wan port so we have to either connect starlink or connect the third cellular modem that we have on the roof via this sim injector but you know just wanted to explain what it is it's actually not in use right now because we're using the starlink but if you wanted to not do starlink you can add a sim injector and a third cellular modem to the roof so you'd have those two on-board cellular modems in the command center here in the transit pro and then via the wan port you could have a third modem up on the roof that's how a lot of people add 5g support to these setups if they're not interested in looking at starlink so again a lot of options but today we're just going to focus on how we've got this one wired all right so i changed up the camera angles a little bit to hopefully give you better views of what we've got going on here before we start one thing i forgot to mention is that all of the stuff that i showed you prior to right now is running and operating on 12 volts meaning it runs directly from my house batteries now why that's important is that i don't have to have an inverter on for my internet solution to work up until this point when we start to play around with some of the stuff in here i unfortunately need an inverter because uh starlink primarily has to run on 110 volt power based on it really being a system that's designed for residential or rural home use that they've they've done some marketing to say it's an rv specific product but unless you're going to build antenna masts and have an inverter and do a bunch of stuff it's it's a bit tricky but it's working so i don't want to bash it but it's it's uh it's it's a residential product we're using for mobile use so okay so let's get this opened up so i've actually taken a fixed mount uh tv mount that you see here and i've replaced it with a swing arm that has a lock so right behind the tv here there's a small cable it's a short one that you can't see unless you know you put your finger on it just a little strap and then that can unlock and bring this whole unit out and as i said before let me see if i can try to get around this accessibility and you know not having to see it is a key thing for me now again on that starlink component so i've got my starlink router here it's wired up to grab my inverter power from the same cabinet where my router is i had to drill a hole in there and put some nice cabinet grommets on there to make it look nice but that is where the wire goes you see this big mess of wire here starling ships with a 75 foot proprietary cable that you know unfortunately that means i've got 50 something feet of wire that i've got to hide somewhere it's not ideal i'll actually show you a picture right here of what this looked like before i added starlight and i hate to put stuff like this on videos because i don't like to share hey i buried 70 feet or 50 feet of cable in the cabinet but when all i can buy is cables that i can only buy from you and my only choice is to cut a cable and do some frankenstein to something that might void the warranty and probably will damage the device i i'm just going to wrap it up in here and hope that they build something a bit uh more modular for the future but behind here if you look kind of up here you've also got my cell booster that's my weboost cell booster that again it primarily only works for us we only really use it to boost our voice calls and the transmitter antenna is here um on this other cabinet i didn't show you before but it's just a small little table top antenna that transmiss the roof one is what we showed you earlier now why is it in this cabinet the main reason is because when i'm driving down the road in the rv my cell phone's very close to here so it will pick up that signal from the booster and allow me to do my work calls while i'm on the road so that works really well and in a pinch if i need the booster to work with the cell modems in the pep weave transit pro that command center i can unscrew that roof antenna and plug in these small little black stubby antennas that came with the router and just place it nice and close to that internal transmitter from the booster so that is something that can work we've got some articles on boosters versus roof antennas and as i said before the roof antenna is the way to go but in very very minimal situations i could technically remove that roof antenna and use the booster also um which you can probably see in this side here it's kind of tucked up in this corner is a ethernet adapter which is an option from starlink and with again those proprietary cables this gives me an ethernet out which i can then plug in to my pepwave transit pro command center here via a standard ethernet cable and that allows me to use the starlink via the wan port now you can use starlink via wi-fi wan meaning this starlink will broadcast wi-fi and the command center will pick it up and then it can become one of your five connections my problem with using wi-fi wan is i have a wi-fi transmitter here and i have a wi-fi transmitter here and in normal applications you really wouldn't want two wi-fi is transmitting so close together because they're going to create a lot of interference for each other so it works but i'd get that ethernet adapter if you're thinking about doing something like this and then inside the starlink app you can disable wi-fi and you can put this in what's called pass-through mode and basically what that means is hey starlink just act like a satellite modem don't do a bunch of router stuff because you've got the command center already doing all that so essentially what i have is the starlink's in in that pass-through mode and all it does is hand off the internet connection to the transit transit pro the command center in here to really manage my connections and that's how we get connected with our starlink as well as our cellular modems all right so let me get this all put kind of back away so you kind of see how this all works it's pretty modular and pretty fast and pretty accessible now while i'm doing this you can also notice in this corner that i have a modular fuse six fuse 12 volt fuse block there and i've taken 12 volt that i've tapped off of a cigarette lighter that's got plenty of amperage in the integra coach and i've run the wire up through to this area and then i've put secondary fuses in here for my transit and other devices that i use including that router up on the roof or i'm sorry that well it is a router up on the roof which is my third cell modem when i'm not using starlink but now i have it all fused all nice and safe and all in one location this little fuse box here actually will if a fuse blows it turns on a red light so i know which fuse is blown and we sell those at mobile mustang.com they're actually an option with our bundles and with our routers at checkout if you're interested in adding a little 12-volt dc fuse block you know it doesn't just have to be used for pep wave it can be used for anything we often use those all over when we're doing sort of projects and other fun things to improve our motor home all right so now we're in the back of the rv and i wanted to show you that access point the secondary wireless transmitter i talked about earlier so inside this cabinet with our clothing up top this is kind of where the factory wiring was in the integra for the rear of the coach now we found ethernet here that was controlling um it was controlling the tv remotes on the vega touch for integra and that like i said before it's all of it's all the same network with the ethernet so up here what we have here is an access point called the ap rugged now most of our customers will go with the apax lite because it has wi-fi six it's a little bit newer but for me what i like about the rugged is it has two ethernet ports on the front so what i was able to do is uplink with the blue cable from my factory wiring and then the second port i plugged back into the vega touch system so that all of the vega touch controls would continue to work but this wireless transmitter now broadcasts wi-fi in the rear of the coach another really cool feature about that command center the max transit that is in the ultimate road warrior bundle is it has a wi-fi controller in it and what that means is it can control secondary access points like this one so if i make changes to like my wi-fi password or anything else it'll update all of the access points all at once from that central command center so it's really easy to use some people ask us can we use off-branded or different branded access points with pep waves the answer is yes but it's a lot easier if you use the access point controller that comes with the ultimate road warrior bundle because everything's centrally managed it also makes sure that the access points operate on complementary channels so that they don't fight with each other and you get the best possible coverage one thing you might have noticed here with the ap rugged is that if you see up close here it doesn't have any power running to it so it's like how is it working without power it's using something called power over ethernet and that means that it gets the power from this ethernet cable and that's because we installed a network switch in our downstairs area that was pre they had a network switch in the integra uh we just replaced it with a better one that provides power all right so that's the physical installation for our internet so that mobile command center like we talked about before it gives us access to those five wan sources and we're using the ethernet wan to plug in the starlink and that gives us a ton of flexibility so that's physical now i'm going to pop over to my computer and we're going to log into the dashboard interface so i can show you how i manage all of this on a day-to-day basis if i want to change which of those when or internet connections i'm using to stay connected okay welcome to my kind of my mobile office here in the in the integra coach this is where i work from every single day so in order to access the dashboard for our peplink mobile router what we do is we go to uh connect to the wi-fi network on the peplink device always make sure you're connected and then we enter an ip address which will show below that's the link to get to the admin panel now you might pop up a security warning there saying hey i'm not sure this connection is secure but remember you're connected to your own device inside your own rv it's secure uh there's just no way to create a certificate out to the internet when you're not actually using the internet you're inside your own network so we're gonna hop over to the computer and i'm gonna walk you around the dashboard using my webcam here all right everyone welcome to my desktop here um let's see so in order to access a peplink router again first of all you need to be on the peplink wi-fi which i am so make sure you always check that step and if for some reason the page that i'm about to show you doesn't come up it's probably because you're not connected to the wi-fi so you can also connect via the lan port with an ethernet cable but that needs to be your first step now pep links by default are at this ip address when you're once you're connected to the local network 192.168.50.1 and you have to type it with periods just like you see here into a web browser now because i'm in the tech industry and i have to connect to a lot of different routers i've actually changed mine to 55 but for most people it will be 50 dot then you can go ahead and get to this login screen and log in the default username and password is admin and admin again if you get a security pop-up before this screen you can just click advanced and proceed and it will work uh fine to bypass that security message and if you want to get really technical and never see that message again in your browser you have to set this address to be a trusted site and then it will stop all browsers are different so google that you'll figure out a way to do that it's pretty easy to add a trusted site now before we get started i do want to mention a website which is guides.mobilemustaf.com and that will bring you to our setup guide section where a number of different guides exist including your standard basic mobile internet get started guides which show you how to do a baseline on both your public pep wave devices and the wireless network best practices guides those are there we also have some wiring diagrams and i'll reference in this conversation some more advanced guides like setting up speed fusion which are also linked in that link those guides are provided free of charge for customers and non-customers but however if you need additional assistance beyond those guides we recommend that you join that membership we talked about earlier at memberships.mobilemusthave.com then you can hop into the forums inside of mobile internet resource center including forums that i'm directly administering to answer more advanced questions that we might cover today so this is the dashboard of my peplin command center or peplink you know mobile router i keep calling it a command center it's not branded a command center it's just that's you know that's what it does for me it's the center of all of my internet connections so right here we've got our five connections we've been talking about are wan sources so i've got starlink i've got my cellular one my cellular two wi-fi wan on the 2.4 gigahertz wireless and wi-fi win on the five gigahertz now at any given time the connections that will be used will be the ones that are in the green status typically in priority one and you'll notice i have more than one in priority one i've got starlink cellular and these can be dragged and dropped into different locations now priority two connections that are in yellow or disabled connections if you brought it all the way down to here will never be used unless the primary connection fails so this would have to go red and then these would turn green saying hey my primary isn't working i've moved to secondary by moving multiple into primary it's using those at the same time and we went over that at a high level but essentially this is set up right now to be operating in uh via speed fusion so this is these are bonded connections together and the way i know that is because right here under speed fusion it shows that i'm connected now i'm not using speed fusion cloud but most customers will i actually set up my own servers in amazon web services but we highly recommend hop over to guides.mobilemustaf.com and use the speedfusion cloud setup guide to get your speed fusion working and it will look and act virtually the same except for you don't have to be an it guy and know how to set up instances in amazon web services which is kind of complicated so anyway as you can see here i've got my t-mobile my verizon and my starlink connected and those are operating if i go ahead and just kind of you know look around and see what's going on here i can also enable my wi-fi wan to connect to the wireless in my barn and i can change these around and that will take a minute to connect and then it will bring it to connected as you see here now i can click on wireless networks and it will show me all the wireless networks that are in this area i actually have to hit rescan here to show additional ones that will pop up in a second because i just re-enabled that but they will show you all the networks there we go that are in this area and i can connect to different networks based on what's available hey look this is a good example look the wan failed at starlink just now and i have a feeling that will pop back and become available in just a minute but something's going on around those trees like i told you about with starlink so this connection went down temporarily i suspect it will come back in a minute automatically the pep link will check if you look down here under details it'll actually show you health check method and it's saying that it's checking every five seconds and if it doesn't hear from the internet in five seconds it'll try three times before it marks that connection and failed yep there now it's back that's what i'm talking about where i say starlink is good but depend you have to have a lot of sky for it to work reliably now because i have speed fusion enabled right now i can actually do something to run a test here which i want to show you guys i'm going to click over to status tab i'm going to click on speed fusion and here's my links and it's showing green i've got starlink cellular cellular and wi-fi wan are all working this one is in priority two so it's yellow now i'm gonna go over here and expand and that's gonna show me all these connections and and pep link's done something great where they've enabled a speed test right in the device where i can actually see each of these connections through my speed fusion connection and run a test i'm going to click download because i want to check the download speed and i'm going to hit start and as you can see right here i'm getting pretty good speed starlink's megabits i got nine coming out of verizon i got five or six coming out of t-mobile my wi-fi is doing great and my total well my starlink dropped to one but my total if you look down here is doing very well 40 50 60 megabits now i might be able to improve this speed by by disabling certain connections that are slower but i'm not necessarily interested in having tremendously high speeds i just want reliability so by having multiple connections enabled and by using speed fusion to bond those connections together i have a lot of redundancy built into my connection in the rv so that's preferred to me i'd rather have 60 megabits like we see here 52 as an average as a reliable connection than only enabling starlink and maybe getting 200 megabits but then it dropping out all the time and causing me problems for work we can also do an upload test here let's do that and we'll see on this upload side what's going on and we see okay well the cellular one is not doing too well starlink's doing okay and our uploads overall because of all these combined connections is doing doing all right i'm getting 10 12 megabits which is a solid upload connection to give you guys an idea like a netflix hd stream would use like three to five megabits download we were getting 60 and if you were doing like a zoom call it was mission critical that'll use about 1.5 megabits so having uh 10 to 15 as we see here is more than enough for me to work and do everything i need but this little tool here is great and allows me to use the bonded connection in this setup but then also see what's going on with each of my connections i can actually click this checkbox here and disable certain connections so if i wanted to just test the starlink let me disable these three and it only temporarily disables them for 15 minutes for testing purposes and then i'm going to go ahead just test starlink and i'm hoping i get some pretty solid numbers here and we're doing okay 30 50 starting to climb 60 65 59 not bad not bad um i did move the rv back a little bit so that i could get some good test numbers from where it was parked before so i have a little bit more sky to play with but yeah i it's a little slower than when i had all the connections together but still pretty good overall so i know that's a healthy connection and i can actually go ahead and enable let's say cellular one turn off starlink and then test that connection and by doing this i can figure out which ones of my connections are the healthiest and use those uh optimally it looks like t-mobile is doing pretty good i'm getting 30s 35 36 not bad so this is some of the power that i have in the command center to see what's going on with my connections i'm going to go ahead and enable all these back just so that they're back to enabled and show you guys one more thing before we wrap up the next thing i love about this setup is my usage reports i can go into again the status tab and then click on daily and look at each of my sim cards or my wan connections and see my total gigabytes used up and down by day by hour or real time real time is a really nice view where i can see the aggregate transfer of my connections so if i'm having problems i can actually right here see how much bandwidth's being used and then scroll down and see star link in each of my modems independently to diagnose if one of my connections is having a problem causing me to get frustrated so that's a quick overview of my dashboard and why i think it's so powerful to have a multi-wan router as your central command center for reliable mobile internet all right folks so that's how we connect to the internet and hopefully it gave you a kind of a brief overview of all of our wan connections and how we stay connected with multiple internet sources as well as how we can administer them on a dashboard with a single place to get to everything now we find that this is absolutely the most reliable and trouble-free way to get yourself on to using mobile internet reliably now again like i've said multiple times in this video this is a long video that explained a very complex solution that most people don't need but that central command center that pat that peplink max transit pro device or really any of our mobile internet bundles that you find at mobilemusthave.com will include the core components that you need to get connected if you're a mobile worker like me that ultimate road warrior vr2 is a great solution because it's giving you some of the the redundancy with those two cellular modems but maybe you want

{"id": "VppXRKKQALw", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "2m1Kiuwyk_00bFYGxljMm_7WbVc", "transcript": "hi guys this is andy from mobile must-have and in this video we're talking all things sim cards how to install them how to use them and any tips and tricks you might have [Music] so this is going to be a jam-packed video with lots of stuff around sim cards it's going to kind of bounce around a bit so what i've done is i've put timestamps and you can see it along the uh kind of the timeline here so if you need to jump ahead to a certain section for installing or troubleshooting or sizing make sure you feel free to jump ahead that's okay and we're going to cover each of those sections there you can also see a list of them in the description below now before we go any further don't install your sim card unless you've been told your sim is activated now this is definitely true for mobile must-have plans but even if you're getting a plan for my carrier or another reseller i would not have that sim card installed until it's been activated sometimes that can cause some delays or even kind of burn the sim if it's been activated while in the device so just kind of keep it out of the device until to get that green light next thing we're going to talk about is actually kind of breaking it out in sim card sizes so when we ship sims from old mustang you're gonna get kind of a full credit card size sim card um and we need to break it out to the actual like just the sim card size itself uh so to do that you can just kind of break these like little pieces and sometimes bending it gently and waiting for it to snap will be kind of the trick here it's all about being delicate you don't need scissors or anything it should kind of pop out but that's uh the way to do it now sim cards from a must-have and in most cases most carriers are using tri-cut sims what this means is this one sim card can actually be transitioned into three different sizes the big size the kind of one that pops out of the card initially is the standard or we call it full size sim the next one down is going to be the micro sim and then the nano sim is basically the size of just the chip itself uh but that would be the nano sim now for the devices we sell and mobile must have we typically use two different sizes the first is going to be the full-size sim so that's all kind of three pieces together um for this t-mobile what's that it's that pink one and with everything filled in if you've got one of those devices you're probably gonna be using the full-size sim you can see the sim slots on the bottom and the sim card from this you know from the long side will fit perfectly in that now some of our newer devices like the 5g devices um they are actually switching over to a nano sim on this device you can see here this is the sim cards come on come on there's the nano sim um if i put this card up to it you can see this sim card is much bigger than just the width of those can't mix up too much i do want to say and i want to i want to make sure it's very clear do not put a nano sim by itself into a full-size sim unit the sim will just basically get eaten and if you kind of take the device apart to get it out it voice the warranty so be very careful with doing that if that happens to you definitely reach out to us as soon as you can you can send it to mobile must-have and we can fix it without avoiding the warranty um but uh if you've put it in there and you can't get it out don't mess with it you could actually make things worse uh pretty quickly so just if you're not sure double triple check or reach out to us but full-size sim and you can see how it will fit the full-size sim fits really nicely in that slot and even without it going all the way in it will hold it if it's way too small don't put it in now uh one quick thing i'll mention i'll get back to this in a bit if you only have a nano size sim and you're trying to get to a full size sim uh we have a sim adapters so you can get basically one of these the white size plastic for the sim card size you've got and you can size it up if you need to some more on that later now regardless of which pep wave you have installing the sim is a pretty similar process uh first you're going to need to remove the dust cover off of the pep wave itself um and then each pep wave typically has two sim card slots some have four but all of them usually have at least two uh and they're going to be like there's one on top and then one on the bottom you can see that here to install the sim card you basically will put the notch of the sim card you can see there's an a and the b and if you hold the sim card up next to those pictures you can see which way a and b should go the thing you're looking for is the notch on that particular sim card itself once you push it in you'll actually hear a little click and that is basically a spring setting so you can push it again and have the sim card come back out to you sometimes i have found that with new devices the spring is already set in like someone put a sim in but then just pulled it out instead of pushing to get the spring to release it so you know maybe it might not push the first time this is with my sim card fully inserted into this particular device here i'll show you b-roll of this too so you can see a little bit of the tail of the sim card and that's made so i can push on it with just my finger tip pad and i can pull the sim card out i don't need tongs or tools or anything to do that i can just put the sim back in i can just push it and it stays in and i can feel it click and it kind of sits a little bit back out i can push it again and the sim card will come all the way back out it'll eject itself so i can take that there same thing for any nano size sims it works identical there's a spring you can push make sure the chip itself is facing the other slot and the notch even of the nano size is going on the in setting so they work identical but just different sizes there now let's talk sim card adapter we sell these sim card adapters on our store and basically what they are is they're aware a way to size up your small sims like this is nano sim and let's say i needed to bake it into a full size sim to go into an older transit duo or something i can use this kit to do that so in this kit we basically have three sim cards we have a sim uh sim removal that's typically needed for a phone but although it can do like a factory reset on the pep waves and then we have a usb device here um so what i need is i need the nano to full size that's going to be this middle one in my case so i can just slide that out of i'm going to slide that out of the case and then i need to just kind of put the chip in now it'll only fit one way with the notch so just make sure you kind of make sure it's faced the right way we're gonna kind of work it in place here and it kind of snaps in we like these particular uh sim card adapters because they don't require tape most of them you get off of like ebay and amazon really want you to take the sim card in and then it's locked in like you can't ever change it back out so we got these that just have little tabs um so just kind of be careful with that but then i can take another device that requires a full-size sim and it just slides in perfectly so it works perfectly to kind of size up that sim if you don't have a full-size sim when you're coming from another device that requires a nano or micro sim these kits are what you need to kind of solve that problem if you're going to a larger sim sim device but yeah and then again if i wanted to come back out i could just push on it just like we do with our sim card removal before and i can pull it right back up there we go so once you've got the sim card installed you can make sure the antennas are all tightly screwed on then you can power up the device and once you've gotten through those setup steps i'm not covering those here we've got another video on that here so if you need to learn how to access the dashboard or troubleshooting that can be here but you can go to the details section under cellular and you can find the icc id and that's going to be the sim card id so it's the same number that matches the big credit card style one here if you wanted to confirm that it's being read correctly and the sim is reading all right guys if you have any questions on this video feel free to leave a comment below but it's typically faster if you chat with us on our website or shoot us an email at info mobile must have dot com all right guys hope to see you on the road thanks bye [Music] you", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2022-07-12T16:25:30Z", "channelId": "UCE9KnGK2TcpXLlIi5cQfGvg", "title": "Lets talk SIM

{"id": "XGZMk3SUFsk", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "p2H3ioPgyWCLlvLCr3WIFJ-VlOY", "transcript": "peplink's new max br2 dual 5g mobile router is here it's a game changer for the serious mobile enthusiast come along with us and we'll tell you all about it [Music] now game changer is that's a big word but up until today mobile enthusiasts kind of serious mobile enthusiasts have had to make a couple tough decisions in selecting their products if you think about products that are very popular mobile must have probably our biggest or top selling product operates on the transit series of mobile routers the transit series is popular because it's a dual modem device meaning that you get two cellular modems in this device the trade-off because of this compact form factor and just sort of what's been available up until today has been that those dual modems operate on 4g category 7 or 12 typically and the reason for that is because category 7 and 12 modems only require two cellular antennas and the processors that were in the inside of these devices as well as just the physical size of them limited the ability for you to add uh faster modems into these so that was a very popular choice and still is a very popular choice i would say this is for about 90 of our customers we'll get into the br2 and who we think that's for next this is option one option two was a single modem device with 5g or category 24g this is what we call our speed daemon bundles and this was in the br1 pro line still available today but this was a choice that most of our customers have to make and they still have to make today do i want a dual modem device that's going to probably give me more reliable connections since i can be on multiple sim cards at the same time or do i want the fastest possible single connection that's a trade-off and that's a discussion point that we have with a lot of our customers about which ones best now with the introduction of the br2 you can have both heplink has gotten us two dual 5g while adding additional features and putting this at a price point that is sub 3 000 previous to today if you want a dual 5g in any of the peplink lineups you were looking at north of double that so from a price perspective peplink has absolutely delivered in a time where everything is going up in price they are getting these prices down to where they are accessible for power users who absolutely need to stay connected two other features that have generally always been lacking in the peplink devices up until now this device has the first one is they've added a usb wan port here to the device now this means that i can add a third 5g or 4g depending on what model you pick cellular modem to this device using the max adapter or tethering with a compatible mifi hotspot so that means i'm getting my dual onboard 5g and a usb port for a third connection and since we have three major cell carriers now with verizon att and t-mobile that means that you can have all three of those online and connected using this device either right out of the box if you buy a max adapter or you've got future proofing to add that later if needed next they've added two wan ports and with the advent of starlink where people are utilizing low orbit satellite technology for a wan source this is awesome this means that i can add starlink to the device in addition to my onboard 5g and a and the usb port for another wan device while also having another when two to add for something else let's say i had another uh hotspot that had an ethernet port on it i could jack that into here for another win connection in that situation we'd be looking at one win two win three win and then four and five with the two on board devices that's five connections to the internet before we've even talked about wi-fi wan this thing is a powerhouse with a lot of options next they've added this integrated switch and with a lot of our previous devices we've been very limited to what we can add in terms of wired devices like desktop computers or smart tvs or things security cameras or things that we just don't want to have on our wi-fi network so we've added a four port integrated gigabit switch into this device and you can actually switch the fifth port over to from wan to lan if you're interested in adding a fifth local device or you can keep it as wan if you want to use it as an internet source all changeable inside of the device's web interface we're not done yet there's more on this fifth port or wan one depending on what you select for it this has poe input support meaning that you can power this device via power over ethernet with a power injector for folks that are looking to put this in a remote location where they're having trouble getting power to it they can power this with an ethernet cable and one of our five or eight port poe switches or our poe injector uh all from that ethernet port another game-changing feature next they've put wi-fi six in this device so we've got the new upgraded wi-fi six technology wi-fi 6 is 2 gigahertz or 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz compatible dual band wi-fi it supports wi-fi wan meaning you can connect to public wi-fi campground wi-fi mourinho wi-fi on both the two gigahertz and the five gigahertz channel that would get us up to seven wan connections all simultaneously on this device that's amazing um and the wi-fi six is going to help in busy campgrounds and busy marinas by the by helping us with interference the wi-fi 6 technology does a better job of managing busy spectrums with a lot of wi-fi traffic on it while also improving speeds to devices and for certain uh phones and other devices that are wi-fi six compatible it can actually improve the battery life on some of your devices all right so i jumped right into a bunch of cool features on this unboxing and walkthrough we're obviously we're obviously very excited about this device so let's move on to tell you what's in the box before i get started i do want to mention that if you're thinking about a br2 or any peplink device you really want to think about joining our membership programs you can learn more at membership.mobilemusthave.com and i'll put a link for that right there members receive all sorts of benefits including expedited shipping and discounts on these products and based on the price tag of this device you will more than pay for the membership before just with this one purchase so that's definitely a great idea it will also get you discounts on data plans and access to the mobile internet resource center varying levels of access depending on the membership that you choose but definitely check that out we run forums on more advanced features that we're going to talk about in today's video as well as webinars where mobile internet resource center team members and myself go through with members and talk about features and show how to set them up and a bunch of other stuff so that membership is basically free if you're thinking about buying this device it is free so definitely check that out and if you're looking at a membership you want to buy that membership before buying the device that way your account is upgraded and you get those discounts and added features that we talked about so definitely check out our memberships at memberships.mobilemass let's get on with it all right let's get started with our standard walk around this box that we see here is what the device comes in we're in as i said an originator program where we get these devices before they're available to the public so i'm not 100 certain that this box is going to be the final box design but everything that you see inside of here is what will come with the device now let's start on this side and holy moly we've got a lot of antenna ports now more than ever it's important for you to definitely check which port you're connecting to but we have eight antenna ports here for cellular one gps and two wi-fi for that wi-fi six uh connectivity now a reminder guys the wi-fi antennas have the center pin reversed uh these are what are called rp sma connectors and the cellular antennas and the gps antenna utilize sma connectors so we've got eight cell antennas here four for each of those five g modems for a total of eight i'll install those in a minute and show you what it looks like moving over to this side like all of the br series next generation devices we've moved to the nano sim card we've got four sim card slots just like all other dual modem devices we've got two slots for modem one and two slots for modem two labeled a and b a reminder on how you insert those sim cards uh you always put the notch in first and the metal part of the sim card will always face the opposite sim card so for a the metal face is down and for b the metal face is up and we'll just show you how we insert a sim real quick there you've got those and it includes a dust cover as well that's pretty much the uh extent of what you have on this side of the device moving on to the other side of the device we've got our four lan ports gigabit lan ports we have our two wan ports and it's important to note that these are 2.5 gigabit wan ports and that also means in theory you could do if you move this to a lan port a 2.5 gigabit lan port and uh the new uh ap ax access points do support the 2.5 gigabit uplink port on that port so you could take advantage of some faster wi-fi now 2.5 gigabits is really fast you'd have to have a lot of land traffic going through the device but it can do it and it might be very interesting if you're looking to do large transfers of files to local area storage or something like that having that 2.5 gigabit port as well but again you've got wan one and two with one being assignable to lam moving on to status lights you've got your status light here that will typically be red when the device is booting up solid green when it's booted you've got a cellular one and two light here those will be solid green when the modem is online with the cellular network or blinking if it's attempting to connect next to that you've got your paperclip reset slot um always nice to see that they include that we've got our usb port here for that usb wan and we have our four port power input here that mobile must have can supply you with a direct dc wire cable that we'll get into in a minute but before we talk about that this four port does give you the ability to do ignition sensing and what ignition sensing means is that the device can be programmed based on the ignition uh wire which is the top right wire here to uh leave the device on for a period of time or do a variety of different things based on the key position of the vehicle you've also got your yourself a db9 serial connector here and this is from machine to machine communication you can do a variety of things with the i o interface and this to allow the router to control external electronics the device clocks in size wise at about oh i'd say about eight and a half inches wide including these rails that allow you to mount it by about eight inches or so including up to the edge of the antenna so it's pretty much a square device but it's very very low profile we're looking at just about an inch in terms of height so it's definitely something that can be mounted in compact vehicle specific locations moving on to what's included in the box we've got ourselves that four pin uh molex power adapter this adapter is different than some of the other adapters that uh peplink has in that this is a three amp up from a 2 amp adapter this is going to output 12 volts to the device at 3 amps we've got a gps antenna here with that included bit of cable just like always we have our eight cellular antennas here again four for modem one four for modem two we have our uh wi-fi antennas two wi-fi antennas and then i've also included here our little sim dust cover they've also included inside the box a bit of peplink wire management uh you know just to keep everything nice and organized it's a nice touch and they've also included a small quick start guide inside of the box that helps you get everything physically plugged in now with all pep link devices the documentation that comes in the box is relatively limited the extensive online manual exists and we always have that available for download on the documentation tab of the listing we also have extensive guides for setting up these devices available for our customers and our members at dot guides.mobilemust-have.com for you it administrators out there this device will support drop-in mode what drop-in mode does is it allows you to put this device in between a wan source and your existing firewall and this device will pass traffic through using your wan source and then can uh provide load balancing and that 5g failover support while allowing you to continue using your current firewall and network devices now this is a powerful firewall and i would say don't use drop-in mode unless you have a absolute need a requirement to based on existing legacy networking equipment those blaze and fast 5g cellular modems inside this device are going to support a max download rate of 4 gigabits per second and a max upload rate of 700 megabits per second 700 megabits per second when you're operating on 5g those modems are also going to give you band support or channel support for pretty much every channel you need in the united states that's important on the cellular carriers so you're getting that band 71 support on t-mobile that's super important and the n71 support on t-mobile and you're getting that band 14 support that's super important on a t which is their first net band as well as a variety of additional bands for those of you that don't understand or know what bands are they're very similar to like tv channels they're the channels in the air that the cellular carriers operate at and by having a device that supports more channels you have access to more of the spectrum to get more speed and more download or in some cases it can mean the difference between being connected or not so it's definitely a big deal to get yourself a category modem that is up there category you know 20 in this case slash 5g will give you the most possible chance of getting connected at the highest speeds this device also has the ability to support an external sim injector that peplink manufactures i'll show you a picture here of my setup with an external sim injector you can connect this device via an ethernet cable to that external sim injector and that will add eight additional sim cards to your arsenal that you can switch to in the web-based interface sim injectors can also work over wan believe it or not so that's very important for folks that are looking for remote deployments mostly it administrators where they want to be able to have their sim cards located inside of their data center and remotely inject the sims to far off devices it can be done with remote sim injectors this device also supports peplink's latest e-sim technology it's relatively new but it is coming along allowing you to purchase data plans from pep link directly to get this device online remotely that can come in really handy if you're an it department and you need to get this device online just note that the data plans as of today are fairly cost prohibitive for mobile travelers who are looking for higher gigabyte data plans this device is compatible with all the major cell carriers in the us and is considered a global device as with any new device if it is not certified on the network for example verizon right now this device is not certified on you may experience issues if you walk into a verizon store and you attempt to activate the device that's not to say it's not verizon compatible but verizon only allows certified devices to be activated you can get around that in certain situations um and the certification is in process so it is coming very soon for corporate customers you can typically activate your verizon sim directly in your account and then just move the sim over to the device but if you're not a corporate customer and you want to be on a verizon direct plan that you purchase directly from the store reach out to us and we'll give you some options on how to get that done if you purchase a data plan from us or the either the r300 r1000 or any other data plan available at mobilemusktop.com those devices or data plans i should say will work right out of the box in our devices including the br2 a complete list of specifications for this device is located on the documentation tab that will also give you a detailed list of the cellular bands that this device supports documentation tab under the listing pages also make sure to check out the independent analysis tab on the listing page there you'll find links to the section from the mobile internet resource center on this device the mobile internet resource center is a third-party independent member-funded community that provides information on all things mobile internet including the br2 all right so let's get these antennas installed just so i can show you just what this guy looks like with all this stuff connected it's actually uh not as busy as i thought it would be it does manage to get it done so we'll get you a little time lapse you don't have to watch me screw all these in all right so look at that bad boy i bet peplink had to take some of their manufacturing staff at to a steak dinner after tom they had to hook up all those internal components that must have not been easy we've got all the antennas installed there with the exception of the gps antenna which comes on that pigtail but that would be pretty easy to install um it requires a little bit of pivoting or rotating antennas to get the other one screwed on as you probably saw in that quick time lapse but it wasn't too bad and there you go it's gonna come with everything needed to get this thing up and running on your desk or in your rv right out of the box you might be asking yourself about roof antennas we talk a lot about roof antennas on this channel and in order to get a roof antenna that would work with all of this including the wi-fi wan you'd be looking at an 11 in one roof antenna so there would be eight cellular antennas two wi-fi and one gps presently we do not have any 11-1 antennas available however that's probably going to change very soon so don't listen just to this video make sure you check out the description and the link in the listing page now if you are a customer previously and you have an existing seven in one antenna you can utilize a seven in one antenna with this device you could you could use your existing four leads for cellular just for one modem and then you could use the small paddle antennas for the second modem or you could potentially use two and two up to your roof and then meaning modem one and modem two would have two leads up to the roof and then your secondary two for each modem would utilize these small stubby antennas so you can upgrade to the br-2 and keep your seven in one antenna and just utilize the small guys for secondary connectivity and down the road you could upgrade to an eleven and one when they're available or you can add a four by four mimo which is just four cellular leads for a second antenna up to the roof and keep your seven and one antenna as well you'd have two antennas on the roof um but whatever 11 and 1 they're going to come out with is going to be fairly large so a seven and one and a a four by four mimo four and one uh probably would be about the same size so it's really up to you based on where you are in the progression of your mobile internet setup the br2 has an integrated access point controller so it has these integrated radios into it so it'll work on its own right outside of the box but if you're in a larger setup maybe a large rv um a transportation uh deployment of some kind trains etc or a yacht or a boat that you have larger square footage to cover the device will support the ability to add on external access points right here i've got an apax enterprise access point that's a monster that supports hundreds of clients and then a little mini these are all poe supportable the apax light i don't have with me but that would kind of fit right in the middle here at about 50 of the size bigger than this one and smaller than this guy but that integrated access point controller is going to allow you to see all of your access points on the central dashboard inside of this device and it will provision these all based on whatever wi-fi profiles you set up for most customers that means that the wi-fi name the ssid or the broadcast name that you set up in this device will then mirror to these devices and all be centrally managed you can push remote firmware updates to these devices and do all sorts of administration with your secondary access points including setting up secondary networks guest networks and all things that you can possibly think of so that integrated wi-fi ap controller is a absolute nice touch if you're looking at a leveled up mobile internet solution the br2 is a prime care device and that means that it is subject to prime care warranty licensing with prime care devices you get licensing for speed fusion and speed fusion connect which previously was called speed fusion cloud now we have a lot of different information about what speed fusion and something called sd bonding or sd-wan bonding does but to keep it simple for this product overview speed fusion essentially allows you to connect multiple lan sources together via a vpn tunnel to bond multiple connections together into a single more reliable more resilient internet connection speed fusion is going to be absolutely an awesome feature in a device with this many internet connections you've got cell modem 1 cell modem 2 you've got that wan port that you can use starlink or a wired internet connection for you've got that usb port so you can add in another 5g capable modem you have another wan port so you can add another hotspot device and then you've got your wi-fi wan so you can connect to public wi-fi and you can combine all of those wind sources together into one single connection using speed fusion and with that onboarded processor and memory and the capacity of this device it's going to operate better than any other multi-wand device in a sub 3 000 price point that peplink has had to date if you'd like to learn more about speed fusion i absolutely again would recommend that you check out our memberships at membership.mobilemusthave.com inside of that membership we've done a webinar specifically on speedfusion and we also have how-to guides on how to configure it available at guides.mobilemusthave.com so you don't have to join a member to membership to learn how to use speedfusion but you're going to definitely get a lot more information as well as access to forums where you can ask questions of folks like us on more of the advanced technical support team if you're a member so i would check that out to learn more about speedfusion peplink and primecare specifically also gives you access to the latest firmware updates on these devices as well as the ability to access this device via the cloud via something called in control in control allows you to see the status of this device look at statistics about wan health look at how much data has been downloaded by any particular wan source check on just about anything related to the device so it's it's indispensable for it support folks but if you are looking to have your um you know you know your your yacht or your rv uh remote and you want to make sure that you can remotely administer and check on it in control is a great feature that comes with it now all pap-link devices come with an operating system that's uniform and runs pretty much on all of their devices they're on as of the time of making this video 8.2 and then some i think it's 8.2.1 they'll probably be on nine very soon as well and what that means is that they're constantly updating the software on these devices so that you're getting the latest features and security patches and updates so by going with a provider that is running a single operating system very similar how apple runs their devices you're going to be getting the benefits and the advantages of those constant updates for years to come with a device like the br2 as mentioned before we have direct wire dc power kits for mobile internet installations available as options on the listing page so this is a direct wire dc cable you've got your 4-pin molex connector there your integrated fuse and 10 feet of direct wire cable inside of that optional kit you may also well you will also see this available as an option which is our six port fuse box this is really not needed if you're just installing this device but if you have multiple uh devices in a tech cabinet and you want to kind of clean it up and make it look nice and make sure it's all fused nicely this is a nice touch as well comes in at a very low price point essentially what you do here is you run 12 volts make sure you get a nice good size wire depending on what the load is here you run your positive and negative up to these ports and then you've got your atc blade fuses that get installed here your 12 volt power will come off next to each fuse to power each device you can have up to six fused circuits and then these ports below here are your 12 volt negative so you'd come off 12 positive and negative 12 positive and negative and so on these little lights in the middle here will turn on if you have a blown fuse so a lot of folks ask us what this is so i wanted to include it in the video so everyone knew that it's not needed for everyone but it is an option if you want to clean up your wiring and uh you know have more than one device powered by the same 12-volt circuit for availability and estimated ship dates make sure to check out the listing page which we will link in the description below again make sure to check out that membership program at memberships.mobilemust-have.com if you're looking at a device like this it will pay for itself in the first purchase thank you guys so much for watching and we will see you on the road [Music] you", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2022-06-15T14:00:29Z",

{"id": "LYSXOi88qtc", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "oQweg0o60uq4wngf8spuV74pCxA", "transcript": "peplink is changing things up again with their new max br1 mini new for 2022. come along with us and we'll tell you all about it [Music] the max br1 mini new for 2022 is available in our full timer vr2 bundle or available for sale just as the router itself so you're watching this video on the listing page for both of those you're probably watching the same video but that's okay everything you're going to hear here applies if you're going to the bundle we're going to talk a little bit more about bundles later in the video and if you're just looking at the router itself well all the features we're going to discuss on the router itself will be for you before we get too deep into the technical stuff on this modem something to understand about pep links in general is that they all run on a time-tested and continually updated operating system very similar to android phones or apple phones these run on an operating system across multiple devices and platforms right now they're on version 8.2 by the time you watch this video they could be up in 9 10 who knows but devices that are five plus years old that we've sold are running on firmware that was released just a few months ago that means security patches feature updates improvements to the devices are constantly being released and that's why they're so reliable now looking at it kind of initially and just giving you kind of the view there it looks a lot like the previous generation mini but it does have a number of different uh changes to it and on the inside even more changes to it so this is actually built on the max transit mini platform which was a device that was initially rolled out for for police and actually motorcycle use as one of the first devices that had ignition sensing technology that would work really well in motorcycle police bikes so they took a lot of what they learned from the transit mini and they brought it into the br1 mini in this new generation chassis so even though it does look very similar it actually has quite a bit more going on under the hood it has an increased processor and memory capacity that gives this a much improved throughput the previous generation devices were looking at about 100 megabits of throughput regardless of what modem was in them that was kind of the max the router could handle these devices are up to 300 megabits of throughput now that will come in really handy for our customers who may be thinking about potentially adding multi-wan or potentially starlink to this wan port here but we'll get into that later in the video let's just start with an overview the max br1 mini is launching with a category 6 modem capable of 300 megabits per second download and 50 megabit upload speeds that's pretty respectable and that's a better modem than we see in just about any device that's pre-installed on an rv that modem is capable of operating on verizon and at t and t-mobile but it does tend to perform best on verizon uh att and t-mobile in kind of that order based on the bands that it supports going into the basics let's talk about kind of what we have here and what's in the box we have our max br1 mini router here we've got two cellular antennas we have two wi-fi antennas we've got a power supply here that's an ac power adapter that converts to the 4-pin molex connector they are now using for powering devices optionally at mobilemustsab.com we have proprietary cables that allow you to direct dc wire with a fuse these devices directly into your mobile installation they also have included some branded wire management and a gps antenna with a six foot pigtail lead they've also included a new quick start guide and we kind of helped uh recommend that they replaced the older guides that were a little bit confusing a couple things we really like about this new guide they've included descriptions of the different antennas and their connectors so people are not confused as well as a more clear explanation of how to get the device online for initial configuration via the web administration portal of course if you're a mobilemustov.com customer right when the device ships we will send you a complete customized guide on how to get all this working included detailed video series and advanced setup and troubleshooting guides so there's a lot more to how to get these devices set up than just this little card but this is a nice touch and makes a lot more sense and is much more updated to the hardware in the newer devices stepping over to the router itself for a minute we actually consider this device the replacement for the br1mk2 and that's a big shift for peplink they previously kind of had that mini series that was their kind of lower end entry level device it had a metal case but it just didn't have that kind of oomph and that foot fit and finish and that weight that you saw in the mk2 and also the performance and the specifications that you saw in the mk2 so what they're doing is they're actually kind of moving away from the mk2 in favor of the br1 pro series for their higher end devices we've got a couple of those over here but if you're interested in looking those up look up our speed demon bundles and you'll be able to kind of understand what you could do if you want to get into faster devices these are going to be considered kind of really good entry-level mid-level devices for what we consider just kind of basic full-timer use um you know you're not necessarily working from the road you're not blogging or youtubing but you want to stay connected and have a reliable connection where you don't have to reboot all the time this is the device that's going to get you there in the in the lineup at the best possible price in our opinion okay so what makes it a lot like the mk2 and a kind of step up from the previous generation mini well like we said before we've got that upgraded processor and that higher throughput so we're talking about a a computer inside here that's capable of moving more information faster so that's a very good thing in addition to that what let's just look over here and go through kind of our primary ports we've got two lan ports up from our single lan port on the mk2 and this is for connecting local devices computers desktops wireless access points things of that nature that you want to connect via an ethernet cable we have a wan port that's assignable over here that can be assigned to a third lan port as well and we'll talk about how this wan port is enabled through licensing in a minute we've got our three status lights our status which will be solid green when the device is on or red when it is booting up or flashing red or solid red if there's a problem wi-fi which is going to tell us that our wi-fi is broadcasting that's our local network that's going to connect to our devices and then our cellular light here the cellular light will be solid green if you are connected to the cellular network up to a cell tower or it will be blinking uh if it is trying to connect or it will be off if the cellular modem is disabled and then we have our four pin power connector over here and that powers up the device via 12 volt power with a direct wire cable or via the 110 120 volt ac adapter that comes with the device there's also a reset button here for a paper clip if you want to factory reset the device by holding a paperclip in there and we have reset instructions at support.mobilemust-have.com flipping the device around to the antenna side of things we have two wi-fi ports here and that is a big change from the previous generation minis that means that this device not only supports 2.4 gigahertz wi-fi or longer range wi-fi but it's also a little bit slower but also 5 gigahertz wi-fi which is a bit faster and by having a dual channel radio you can support more devices and you can put devices on the slower longer range or faster shorter range wi-fi or let the router do it all for you because it will by default in auto depending on what's best for you but having a dual channel wi-fi integrated into the mini is a nice step up for 2022 and that is was a big differentiator to why people moved to the mk2 in in previous generations because that added wi-fi was a huge benefit uh we have our two cellular ports here just like the other uh mk2 and the previous mini and we have a gps antenna port here that allows you to track the location of the device or the vehicle via the secure online in control cloud-based portal system that is uh hosted by peplink down below that we have our dual sim card slots and a reminder folks that this is a single modem device it has two sim card slots but only one of them can be used at a time you can load this up with two sim cards for instance a verizon and an at t sim and then through the management console you can switch between them at a click of a button for 2022 peplink is moving devices to a nano sim size so they previously were using a large sim i'll show you a picture of a large sim and a nano sim next to each other and for 2022 in this device they are moving to the nano sim we like that the smaller sim slot is now the standard especially because it prevents customers from accidentally putting small sims into larger slots and losing them inside of the device so that is a nice touch to go with the nano sim slots a reminder to customers for these sim card slots just because they're confusing for folks if you look at your sim card there's going to be a small little notch there and we want to make sure that we put that notch in first and then look for the metal kind of chip part of your sim and put that towards the other sim card slot so if i'm going to use sim card slot a here as i'm showing you really quickly the metal is going to be pointing down and the notch is going in press that in you'll hear a click and that you can let go that means it's seated if you press it in again you'll hear a click and it will pop out just like that and then it's unseated if you're interested in going to the sim card slot 2 you have to pull that out keep that notch going in forwards and then flip that over flip it over so the metal is pointing up towards sim a and then go ahead and press it in to lock wait for that click and you can press it again and you'll hear the click to unlock it it's a little confusing though because the sims have to be flipped over depending on whether or not they're in sim slot a or b that's just the orientation of how they got everything into such a compact case and design another cool feature that the br1 mini has up its sleeve is that this lan 1 port actually accepts poe in and this can be confusing for folks if they see that poe sticker and they think oh this will power an external access point that's not actually what this is for but this device can be powered with a poe switch so uh what would you need that for well for certain remote installations or if you're putting this up in a ceiling or in a particular area and it's difficult to run power to this device you can run an ethernet cord and that's really it and then power the device with an external poe injector or a poe switch we sell poe injectors that will take 12 volt right off of your chassis or house batteries and up convert it right up to the 48 volts needed for poe as well as five and eight port switches that will do the same and just give you more ports so a lot of flexibility in certain situations there are actually antenna manufacturers that are starting to make roof antennas or large enclosures that accept mobile routers like this inside the enclosure so you could in theory run an ethernet cable up from power inside the rv and mount this outside inside of an antenna housing up on the roof now just be careful with that if you are going to be thinking about doing anything like that you will likely void this warranty if it's out in an unimproved enclosure that's designed by another manufacturer it's not to say you can't do it but you got to make sure you have proper ventilation you keep this away from water but that is kind of a cool feature and the real benefit of having this really close to a roof antenna would be your antenna wires to that antenna would be very short for optimal signal okay so let's talk about licenses and features and some of the stuff that peplink has changed by bringing the max br1 mini into what is called prime care for those of you don't know if you scroll down on a listing there's a detailed explanation of what primecare is it's a different version or flavor of warranty by peplink and it also entitles you to some cloud functionality if you want to remotely administer the device all devices come with one year of prime care included and if you want to know what it costs to kind of in increase or renew your prime care on every listing page at mobilemusthave.com you'll see one additional year two additional year etc for adding prime care licenses which will also give you that hardware warranty in case anything ever happens to your device there are additional features with speed fusion and other stuff we're not going to cover in this video but we do have separate videos specific to those on our youtube channel and we can link to those in the description below as well if you're kind of interested more in stuff around what prime care is but specific to the max br1 mini we want to talk about some licensing options that they've included in the device at time of purchase so i don't like talking about pricing on these channels because pricing always changes but at the time of launch let's just say that this modem at its entry level point is at approximately 450 dollars from a from a kind of msrp perspective again check the listing don't hold me to that prices change but that's what we're looking at so for that 449 or 450 dollar price what you're getting is a fully functional device that has the cellular features the wi-fi features and everything that we talked about the only features that it does not have is this wan port which is used to connect an external internet source like a additional um like you could hook up an additional modem that had an ethernet port or additional router that had an ethernet port in you could hook up a cable modem for home internet to this wan port or you could hook up starlink to this port now this feature this port will be disabled by default at that 450 price point now it will still function it'll just work as a lan port which means that you can connect local devices like computers ip cameras stuff like that to this port but we'll talk about what it looks like if you unlock this port with a license in a second the second thing that comes not available at that 450 price point is the ability to connect to campground or free public wi-fi using something called wi-fi as wan now the device hardware wise can support it but again to keep the price down they have locked the wi-fi wan and that wan port function out at that initial entry level price point so what is the cost to unlock those features so for i'm just going to round up for a hundred dollars extra you can unlock the wi-fi wan feature and this wan port feature and to be clear for everyone who's going to have this question because it's a prime care device it is unlocked permanently you don't have to renew prime care for these features to continue to operate you won't have a warranty without prime care but you don't you know it's not like the feature is going to go away if your prime care expires they're not doing anything complicated like that which we're very happy about so for 550 which is 50 less than the mk2 was ever sold for the category 6 one you can have a device that has all of the features of the previous generation mk2 and much faster throughput 300 megabits up from 100 megabits for that 50 savings so we're really happy that they have decided to do that and it also allows folks that aren't necessarily ready to unlock that wi-fi win feature to get it at a lower price point peplink is stepping it up one step further and in that 100 98 whatever it is you'll see it on the listing price point they're adding a second year of prime care in with that feature pack so you get two years of prime care and the feature pack all added in and they also have an option to extend that prime care even further for a few bucks more check the listing and look for the advanced feature pack and prime care options that are available there now the only catch with that license upgrade with this device is that it has to be purchased at the time of purchase of the device don't come back to us and ask us for it later and say can i get the 99 deal it's not us peplink has made it very clear that they have to be registered at the time of sale when we're doing our warranty registration process at the very beginning to register the device to the customer we have to attach that license so we highly recommend that if you're thinking of ever using wi-fi wan or you're thinking of using starlink or this wan port or you're thinking of ever extending your warranty beyond the first year get the feature pack because it's absolutely the best deal because the max pr1 mini we're calling it the kind of vr2 or version 2 even though that's not the official name is such a powerhouse and has all the features of the previous generation mk2 we are using this device in our new full timer vr2 bundle so this device if you are interested in getting it with a paired roof antenna that has been tested by us for optimal performance and matching the full timer bundle is a great way for you to get started with kind of everything you need for those of you don't know bundles come included with that dc direct wire 12 volt power cable that's matched to this device with that proprietary 4-pin molex cable it comes with a five in one roof antenna the roof antenna will have two cellular two wi-fi and one gps antenna all in a nice compact housing for you up on the roof and the modem itself all at a discounted price and for those customers not aware you can also check out our memberships at memberships.mobilemusthave.com and memberships will give you a whole host of additional benefits including

{"id": "1rAQiqM7fHs", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "D_KbAO_gR69DDwJtgc5Rv8xuCWU", "transcript": "peplink's new transit pro dual modem cellular router is here and it's the first full redesign of the transit series since it came out come along with us and we'll tell you all about it [Music] so we're super excited about this router i know we tell you guys a lot of times we're excited but this is the first router in i don't know three plus years that i've actually uh taken apart my own personal rv to install before i did the filming so i had to take it all back apart just to do this video for you guys so this is a big deal router in the evolution of peplink's transit series that we've been using in our ultimate road warrior series and also just for folks that want to buy the modem on its own without the roof antenna now peplink has gotten some flack from folks in the past for their kind of naming conventions there's some names of products that kind of overlap each other and if any of you guys follow our channel you will have known that a few months ago they released the transit pro e and that actually is on the previous generation transit chassis while this transit pro is on the new generation uh it can get confusing folks but you know just to keep it simple we think that peplink is just trying to standardize their naming convention going forward for 2022 and they really want to keep the transit pro line uh to designate sort of their you know higher end portable and also potentially kind of slimmer or smaller form factor and we'll get into that a little bit more but this is called the transit pro new for 2022. so folks may be wondering is this a dual modem device since they don't call it a transit pro duo the answer is yes it is dual modem and they've done some interesting upgrades to the modems that we're going to tell you about shortly so cutting to the chase really early on just to give you a high level feature differentiator a couple things first this due chassis has an upgraded processor and that means faster router throughput on the back end of this device we'll talk about that a bit more in a minute but just at a high level to start one gigabit max throughput up from 400 megabits in the previous model so a significant jump in the back end speed of the processor that handles everything inside of this device next they've upgraded this device to include wi-fi six technology we'll talk about that as well in a minute and the kind of the biggest breakthrough besides the processor increase which is a huge one is that they've changed out the modems that were common in our duos for a a little bit of a different combination of modems to give you wider compatibility across the carriers in the united states the previous generation duo had dual category 12 modems and that performed very well on a t and verizon and also pretty well on t-mobile but it did lack certain bands specifically band 71 on t-mobile so it was a challenge for our customers to get access to a dual modem device so they could use more than one carrier at a time and also get access to band 71 which is super important with t-mobile now to help customers with broader compatibility what peplink has done is they've changed out the category 12 modem in the previous generations in this single slot uh basically modem 1 here on the left for a category 7 modem and you might be thinking to yourself category 7 7's lower than 12 that must be worse actually category 7 modems are newer than category 12 modems and they were released after category 6 and after category 12. we won't get into all that crazy but essentially they were released to add additional bands that us carriers were supporting the big one being that band 71 on t-mobile the category 7 modem in here supports all of the major bands for verizon as well so if you're not looking at t-mobile you can pop verizon in that category 7 modem and get access to all the bands that they're using in the lte spectrum moving on to modem 2 that category 12 modem that one gives you support for band 29 and band 30 which are used on the att network so we recommend that you pop verizon or t-mobile into that first slot and in the second slot we recommend you use at t if you're looking to round out the carriers each of these modems has two slots so there's a four slot total here that we'll get into a bit more when we're going in the overview but essentially what this means is each modem has the ability to switch from slot a or slot b at the press of a button in the management console giving you a ton of flexibility now that's just a recommendation based on a snapshot in time right now for which modems would be best for each carrier but you can always look at a full list of the bands supported for each modem by going over to our website and clicking the documentation tab we'll see a pdf with all of the specifications or bands or you can click out click on the detailed analysis tab where you will be linked over to our friends at the mobile internet resource center and they have gear guides and detailed analysis on all pep link products that are kind of popular in the mobile internet space and this one will be included as well a ton of the information at the mobile internet resource center is provided free of charge and is available to the public they are member funded through a membership community and if you're interested in possibly picking up this modem make sure you check out the membership tab at mobilemusthave.com all of our memberships will give you deep discounts on products like this as well as access to the mobile internet resource center before we get into the unboxing and all the additional features we do want to mention that this is a prime care device and what that means is that it includes licensing for speed fusion and the ability to use speed fusion cloud all included with your purchase and that includes speed fusion cloud access for one year with one terabyte of data now if you're new to mobile internet you don't know what that is that's okay but just keeping it high level if you're going to have two cellular providers and you want to operate them at the same time say t-mobile and 18-t or verizon this modem gives you the ability to combine those connections into one single connection that can give you a lot more redundancy and resiliency on your internet connection so if you're looking at absolute reliability for mobile work or just ultimate flexibility for mobile play this is an absolute top pick for us as of 2022. all right so let's talk about what's in the box it looks so much like the previous generation transit as you can see here in the photos but giving you a high level you've got your four cellular antennas two of those are for modem one and two of those are for modem two you've got your two wi-fi antennas those are the longer ones and just for folks to know you can check on the antenna itself it does say wi-fi on those antennas and the center pin is reversed for wi-fi and cellular when you're hooking these up so just make sure to check on that center pin you have your gps antenna included as well and you have a ac power adapter as well as some mounting ear brackets and we also have the screws here from the dust cover that include that is included that covers your sim card slots if you want to cover them up after you install the sims lastly peplink is adding in some wire management in their signature orange which is quite nice with their logo on it as well to keep things nice and tidy one noticeable change from the previous generation transit is the ac adapter now has that four pin molex connector they've moved away from the dc barrel connector we'll get into power options and how to wire this as well as how to direct wire this in a minute before we move on from the unboxing we want to show you one additional thing these devices typically come with a small ground screw here located in the center screw holes here and that can trip up a lot of customers now as you can tell this entire device is one big metal case so you can move this ground screw anywhere and still achieve the same grounding results but typically if you're in an rv and you're riding on rubber you're not typically grounding this to the chassis anyway so for the most part that's not necessarily really needed but if you remove those ground screws or relocate them to one of the other holes you can take your installation ears here your mounting brackets and you can mount them there on the center as you can see here using the supplied screws a lot of people get tripped up because they think they have to put the ears on opposite sides or both in the front and it can make the modem kind of floppy if you're installing it on a wall so we like to tell folks that we're starting to tell folks in these videos to go ahead and just mount those brackets in the middle so it's nice and balanced and easy to install on your installation location giving you an overview of the device itself here we've got on the front side we've got our green dc terminal port down below we've moved from micro usb power inputs here for portable power packs and we'll talk about that in a minute to usb c ports that's a nice upgraded touch we'll talk about that in a minute we've got our four pin molex connector here for our dc input using the ac adapter or using our optional dc direct wire kit that is fused exclusive with mobilemustav.com if you want to go ahead and direct wire via the 4-pin molex connector then we've got a wan port for ha adding a additional internet source we'll talk about that in a minute and then we've got a lan port for connecting a local device like a desktop computer as with all pep link devices our wan port is assignable so we can move that from a wan port to a second lan port if you want to connect more local devices via an ethernet cable we have our standard complement of lights on this device our status light which will be red when it's booting up or if there's a problem and typically just solid green and our cellular lights that will blink green when the modem is attempting to connect or be solid green when the modem is connected and we've got that for both cellular modem 1 and cellular modem 2. we have a reset port here designated by an arrow with a circle that is for hard resetting the device if you forget your password or if you want to restore everything to factory defaults we have guides on how to do that not that you normally would but they are available at guides.mobilemusthave.com before we move on to the other side you may notice that this green terminal port looks a little different and that's because like i said before i took this modem out of my setup so this typically normally has a plug attached to it which i'll show you here in a picture and there are screw down terminals at the top allowing you to screw down a direct wire kit now with mobilemystaff.com we are including the 4-pin molex connector in our direct wire kits because it's just easier to set up a 4-pin power connector than having to use a direct wire kit and figure out which of these ports are power input now since we're in the video we'll go ahead and tell you that vcc is your 12 volt positive and g and d is your 12 volt negative everything else here is for machine to machine communication and can be disregarded if you're just trying to get on the internet moving on to the other side of the device this looks almost identical to the previous transit series or transit duo i should say so you've got your cellular modem one antenna port one and two your gps in the center and your cellular modem two antenna one and two here down below you have your wi-fi ports wi-fi a and b and again this is the upgraded wi-fi six technology which we'll talk about in a minute one distinct change is that they have moved away from the full size full-size sim cards in this modem this accepts the nano sim cards and i'll click on one and just show you that's that nice little tiny sim card so for if you're purchasing from a must-have.com any data plans um you're covered because we ship all of our sims in tri-cut sims but uh just note that that is going to require a nano sim card but you can pick up extra sim cards from us either to use with our plans which we ship sims included or if you have a direct plan you can purchase sim cards from us with this purchase as with all pep link devices when you insert your sim card you're going to have that small little notch there that's going to go into the device first and the metal there from the actual chip is always going to face the other slot so if you're installing this in slot a at the top the metal will point down and if you're installing this in slot b at the bottom the metal will point up and these are all spring loaded slots so if you go ahead and press those in it will click and the sim is installed properly and nearly flush if you're interested in removing it simply press it again and it will pop out for so that you can remove it all right so let's go ahead and deep dive a little bit into these modems as we said before we've got a category 7 modem in slot 1 here in modem 1 position now category 7 modems have a max download capability theoretical max of 300 megabits per second and a max upload speed of 150 megabits per second and if you ever knew anything about category 6 you'll know that that upload speed is significantly increased as is that download speed but it is less than category 12 so we want to kind of tell customers not to worry tremendously about that that max theoretical speed of 300 megabits is a lot and it's going to get you plenty of performance uh in a device yes you can look at a category 20 or a c or a 5g category 20 device that will outperform this on a single modem basis but you're going to lose out on that dual modem capability unless you step up to like the mbx mini device which we do have and we do sell but those are uh quite a bit pricier north of five thousand dollars so this is really a exceptional value uh if you're looking at a dual modem device and 300 megabits is more speed than the carrier is typically going to give you in just about every location the category 7 modem is a very versatile modem it's exceptionally well balanced for the u.s market so you're covered pretty much 100 in t-mobile as of today's state and the same as verizon and with att even that modem will work fine but if you've got that category 12 right next to it unless you're planning on using two att sims we recommend that you pop your att into modem 2 which we'll get into in a minute but yeah tons of support in the category 7 for just about all of the carriers moving on to modem 2 we've got that category 12 modem and that has the max download speed of 600 megabits per second and max upload speed of 150 megabits per second again plenty fast now in this modem we're covered for all of the major lte bands for verizon and again all of the major bands are all the bands for att as well conversely you can put t-mobile in this slot as well you're just again not going to have access to band 71 which can be important for this for this modem both of the modems support uh the popular bands that t-mobile is using as the result of the sprint merger so you're covered with those as well again this is an overview video if you want detailed specifications make sure to hop over to the listing page click the documentation tab or the independent analysis tab where we'll dive quite a bit deeper with the mobile internet resource center into this product all right so let's move on to wi-fi six now all the previous transits uh had wi-fi five technology which was fine i was working pretty well but wi-fi six is a newer technology and to keep it high level again since this is an overview video why do you care about wi-fi six well it tends to perform better in higher density environments where there's a lot of wi-fi congestion like an rv park so that's very helpful um and it can with certain newer devices like newer iphones or newer android devices also help with the battery life on your devices if they're connected to the wi-fi it's a bit more of an efficient chipset it does have some faster max download and upload speeds as well so overall wi-fi six is really where the technology is going so we're really happy they included it here the wi-fi six chipset inside this device supports both two gigahertz long range wi-fi and five gigahertz high speed wi-fi to give you kind of a high level overview 2 gigahertz like i said is typically longer range but can be a slower speed it also can suffer a bit more for from congestion in rv parks and five gigahertz has shorter range but faster speeds we recommend that you set up your wi-fi in these devices according to our wi-fi best practices setup guide again available at guides.mobilemustaf.com and we recommend you split out the two gigahertz and five gigahertz wi-fi uh by default it's set to auto and the device will just decide for you and we recommend you turn that off and set up in accordance with our best practices just so you can connect to the network that's best suited for the application that you're trying to use as with all transit series modems this device has a built-in wi-fi controller meaning that it can control external pep link access points very easily through a central administration console so it's honestly as simple as checking a boxing enable wireless access point plugging in a peplink device via the lan port and boom you're off to the races it'll automatically provision that device and start using it based on the configurations of the primary device it supports a lot of access points i believe it's 25 plus but you know most people aren't going to put that many in so you're covered from an access point perspective and it also supports wireless mesh or wireless uplink we have detailed guides on all of that at guides.mobilemust-have.com if you're interested in setting that up post purchase this device is available on mobilemustave.com and can be paired with our mmh wireless data plans that run on the major carrier networks so you can pick up a data plan for that category 7 or that category 12 modem or for both modems through us and none of those have contracts and each come with different terms and conditions so if you're interested in a data plan you can bundle them at purchase or you can just go to data plans which is a drop down on mobile internet and check out all the details there so let's talk about max router throughput and kind of why that matters now in the previous generation transits we had a max throughput of 400 megabits per second on the router side but if you dug a little deeper and you were thinking about using speed fusion to connect multiple cellular connections or multiple internet connections together that number dropped quite quite a bit if you were using unencrypted traffic you could get a max of 100 megabits per second and if you were going to encrypt which you are required to do with speed fusion cloud it was dropped to 50 megabits per second so what that basically meant is the max speed you could see out of speed fusion cloud on those devices was 50 megabits per second now that's plenty of speed so if you have one of the previous generation duos it's fine you know zoom's going to use 1.5 megabits if you can get 50 megabits down you're doing plenty fine but it is a noticeable upgrade in the new transit pro the transit pro with that one gigabit max throughput is going to give us a max throughput unencrypted on speed fusion of 400 megabits per second and if we go ahead and encrypt that traffic uh with like speedfusion cloud we're going to get 200 megabits per second so a 4x improvement in speed fusion cloud now obviously that's all very dependent on your cellular providers or whatever you're using as an internet source but it's typically going to include cellular so just keep that in mind it doesn't mean the modem is going to magically give you those speeds you're still dependent on what the cell towers can't give you so if those cellular providers are not giving you that 400 megabits for those really super fast speeds why does it matter to have a router with a faster throughput well one of the main reasons is this wan port here now if you're a customer who may potentially be looking to future proof with stuff like starlink or even a wired internet solution at a campground we know a lot of folks that own sites and they have cable modems or other wired solutions those can be plugged into the wan port and they can be combined via speed fusion with these cellular modems in this device so if we're starting to look at starlink that's you know promising speeds north of 100 megabits we'll see how that really plays out as it becomes more available and more import more and more people start using it but regardless if we're seeing faster speeds both from that and from the cellular providers as they beef up these networks that faster throughput is going to matter as you start to combine multiple connections so it's a big deal for some of our power users that usually don't do this until stage two you can actually plug another peplink device into this wan port it's definitely an advanced configuration but you can do it and that's what a lot of folks are doing who want to experience or experiment with 5g so you can plug 5g peplink into this wan port and then utilize those ultra fast onboard modems as well for a three modem setup which can be really really solid when this is your central command center because of that higher router throughput so this is really what we're recommending as our top pick for your kind of first initial buy because you can upgrade or expand whether it's with access points or additional routers with this device and it comes in at a very attractive price point as mentioned before if you're interested in possibly you know picking up one of these devices and experimenting with speedfusion cloud et cetera we have a plethora of guides available at guidestopmobilemustaff.com those are available to the public but we do kind of ask folks that hey if you're going to use one of our guides and we're helping you out on how to configure some of these advanced products why not pick them up from us as well we appreciate the support it's what funds us to do these fun videos for you guys the transit pro is included in our new ultimate road warrior vr2 mobile internet bundle mobile internet bundles include this mobile router uh or a different one depending on the bundle you choose a direct wired dc power cable that's fused for a direct wire installation on your 12 volt house batteries either marine or in an rv and that can go up to 24 volts if needed if that is applicable for your application and it also includes a roof antenna and there's a bunch of different roof antennas to choose from if you look under the bundle guides you'll see a roof antenna selection guide if you scroll down if you're not sure which roof antenna you want to pick but the biggest most kind of exciting part about bundles is that they are bundled at a discount so you get a discount on if you were to purchase these individually but you can stack that discount so if you're looking at our mobile must-have insider membership program the membership discounts stack on top of the bundle discounts and that can typically mean that you're going to pay for the entire membership fee within your first purchase and also get yourself access to the mobile internet resource center so that you can stay up to date on all things mobile internet and get help uh from us in our advanced support forums on the higher end features of devices like this that we don't typically cover as part of just complementary support for purchase discounts go even further if you're looking at the mobile must have wireless plans because we provide monthly discounts to all members and they combine so if you're looking at multiple wireless plans for a device like this where you need two plans you can get a bundle discount for two plans and then a member discount on top of that as well as your purchase discount so it adds up really fast complete details on our membership are available at membership.mobilemust-have.com and the discounts vary depending on the membership tier you're looking at all right everyone that concludes our overview of the brand new max transit pro my wife is eager to get this back installed in our rig so she can get back on the internet and do some calls for work

{"id": "xTqhLnlM3jk", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "wNxuLvvgg5CKA9aObCg0jjo24rI", "transcript": "hey guys this is andy and eric with mold must have and today we're going to go over the pep wave antennas [Music] so yeah these come in a couple different variants but um they were formerly known as the puma antenna um and they had to change their name uh for one reason or another now they're like called the 42 g it depends on what you get we're just going to call them the pep wave omnidirectional roof antennas it's very simple they don't have any other versions in this kind of format yeah that's what they they come in different variants for different types of modems and we'll get into that and they come in different colors so you can get a black and a white very very unique today we've got two very popular variants this is a five in one antenna and this is a seven in one antenna and andy's gonna talk about the five and one now they come in both colors so i'm showing white but it comes in black and that one's black comes in white uh but this is gonna be the five in one it is a six foot cable um and it has um our sm the cellular side they're sma cables on the wi-fi side they're rp sma which just means reverse polarity they just swap the center pin around and that way you can't put the wrong one in the wrong spot so it's actually it works on quite well a lot of folks think that the pin is missing or that there's something wrong with the modem it's not it's designed that way on purpose but this will match up for just about any single modem pep wave device yeah and these are really great in terms of you can see they're very low profile a very good small size the 701 is gonna be a bit bigger it's got more antennas so but the five and one is nice and small you've got a couple options from mounting as always kind of a very common one is just to surface mounted on the top you have a removable slash optional adhesive mount that's on the bottom which is great and it's removable because if you wanted to go with the pole mount that is included you don't need obviously the adhesive so you can hole mount it now if you are going to go surface mount with this though there is going to be kind of this twisting locking nut on the bottom depending on the this is everybody yeah depending on the type of rv it might not work for you and that's okay that's what the adhesive part is for so don't panic if that if that doesn't fit typically your rv roof's gonna be about four to six inches thick yeah mine's six so yeah and both of us have had antennas adhere directly to the roof with the cables going straight down with an adhesive mount yeah with this 3m with a dicor ring no locking nut just letting gravity and that adhesive tape do its job and had no issues for five plus years it's a very common way to install um in in in mobile mobile uh rv applications yeah so this is a this is a really great option again this is a five and one so your typical uh modems are going to be like the br1 mk2 that is a category six it basically has two lte two wi-fi and gps and that's what this is lined up for if you're doing a single category 12 modem kind of combination this would work well too for that um so it's got a great kind of flexibility to it yeah so a couple little geeked out on specs stuff these mo these do support 600 megahertz so for folks that are interested in t-mobile's rural band uh it will support that and they are 5g compatible as well for future proofing but again five and then stepping up into the seven i'll talk about now yeah go for it all right so yeah we're talking quite a bit bigger this is um about eight inches in diameter eight to nine inches and this one's closer to five significant uh larger size but still a good uh size antenna for how much they're packing into here if you do want to look at a seven and one that's smaller than this uh mobile mark's pretty much the place to go but we'll we'll focus on on this one which has from a feature perspective a very similar set of stuff so we've got our removable adhesive mount here we've got our locking nut here we have the pole mount option we include screws to mount the pole mount to the bottom of the antenna and then they also include a um basically a band connector for doing the pull mount uh as well there's also some uh screw um and and molly's for if you want to do a wall mount application which you can actually do as well with this pole mount um that's probably going to be more for a fixed uh rural home application but it is it is doable stepping up into the seven and one you're going to have four cellular leads so now you can use this antenna with category 18 category 20 you know transit 5g other 5g modems and this will be our pro 5g yeah so we've got four seller leads two wi-fi leads and one gps lead all in a very nice complex now eric one thing we always forget now what about round planes with these ah good question uh the technical answer is no on the spec sheet from pep wave they say a ground plane is not required however if you are in a roof mounting situation where you can add one i'm sure it's not going to hurt to give folks kind of a quick understanding of ground planes we're talking about a piece of ferrous metal underneath the antenna usually somewhere around 16 inches in diameter or something and what it's basically doing is it's helping the cell signal bounce up into the antenna it's not grounded to the frame or anything to do with electrical no uh can't get confusing because some cb radio stuff works with grounding nothing like that it's just a metal uh circle plate that helps bounce the signal into the antenna but again not required according to pebbles and of course if you have a metal roof you definitely don't need one that's the whole point yeah exactly in terms of gain specifications and kind of performance we've had pretty good luck with these in testing um they're not performing quite as high as uh like our our parsec husky antenna which also is bigger so i you know i give them credit they made it into a smaller footprint um but if you want there are specification sheets in the listing under the documentation tab or we highly recommend that you check out the mobile internet resource center at rvmobileinternet.com they are actively testing out uh this and a couple other antennas all the time and they give you big listings of their reports based on locations and cell signal grabs verses and comparisons it's yeah really great resource shout out to chris cherie and andy oh there andy there who does quite a bit of antenna testing um and helps us out to make sure we get you guys all the best and latest information about here's the specs but here's what we're seeing in the real world yeah yeah all right so that's pretty much it this is kind of the uh formerly puma now 42g and and uh and other omnidirectional pepway antenna overviews all right guys so if you have any questions feel free to hit us on chat on our website or shoot us an email at info mobilemustave.com and we'll see in the next video thanks guys bye [Music] you", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2022-03-15T14:00:51Z",

{"id": "ojQQjs-lzQM", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "il8Iz1P7doNAKKKLqO-kk-Xo9zY", "transcript": "hey guys this is andy and eric from mobile must have and in this video we're going to do a quick overview on pull mount the repair options that we have [Music] so before we get started the vast majority of our customers do not need to look at pull mounting options um it's it's complicated to get a pull up in the air so much work to get the cables routed to unplug other stuff so if you're looking or you've seen other videos on the internet um we're going to talk to you about what kind of some of the specific use cases are for pole mount applications in this video but we do recommend if you look at our bundles like our ultimate road warrior plus bundle that includes an omnidirectional roof mounted antenna yeah that is that's the way to go for 99 of rvers um you know if you're looking at a mobile router solution but for today we want to talk about some of our popular pole mounting products and these are great for a rural home application or something that's not moving really at all this is where these really start to excel yeah so let's kind of talk about why pole mounting is popular in the first place so the earth is round most people think that this is a joke long story short every 10 feet of vertical elevation of a cellular antenna will typically give you about double the cell signal strength and that's due to the curvature of the earth cell signals travel horizontally along the earth and you will eventually hit ground if you just go flat and straight at a low altitude so by raising the antenna up you are basically enabling the cell tower and your device to communicate with less stuff in between it and less interference and less bounces off of the ground cars and all these other things interference yeah so going up typically does help now we don't have to go 10 miles up you know we're typically looking at 20 30 feet with most of our poles i think we have a 25 foot pole that we part we pair up with with um on our store and there's some other pole mounting options that we're looking to release in the future um so poles can really help with signal and then once you get into the antennas there's two sort of flavors or variants there's a directional pole mount and then there's an omnidirectional pole mount antenna and that's the configuration of the antenna inside of the case now directional antennas think of it like a laser beam to that cell tower it's it it it does have you know depending on the specifics of the antenna usually like maybe let's call it 15 degrees of kind of like really hyper focused gain where it's going to be able to travel a lot further to get to that cell tower but it's going to be in one direction directional antennas are really popular for folks that are super super fringe or for folks that just have one cell tower or cell provider and they're like i just want to look at that one tower in that one direction and if i can dial in the best signal possible that can not always does but can result in higher and faster download and upload speeds you're still going to be at the mercy of that cell tower you know you can have perfect signal to a tower but if that tower is saturated and it doesn't have anything to give or it's running dsl and it's slow anyway yeah yeah you've got great connection to the tower but out to the internet from the tower there's nothing but the vast majority of cases i know chad from changing lanes did a great video on the x-pole here he saw significant speed improvements by dialing in and pointing a directional antenna to a cell tower in rare cases it can be the difference between signal and no signal but you have to really be out there on the fringe um and be able to really have the patience to find signal and really decide you're going to be there and needing to work if you're that far in the middle of nowhere yeah so directional is let's just we'll say it's the highest performance and it's the biggest pain in the butt yeah yeah but if you're talking about mounting something set it and forget it and not messing with it like in a rural home application or if you have a business you know you're doing oil refinery rigs i know we sell a lot of these to to to folks in texas that are doing like mobile oil refinery stuff that moves around a lot out there they they love these antennas now one thing too i think it's always worth pointing out is while although the heart which is important on poles can improve your overall signal at some point you might have to extend the cable that comes with these now these all have a lot of cable that comes with them they've all got about 15 feet per line which is a lot but what happens if i go past the 15 feet and extend it is extending it worth the height gain that's a big question yeah it can be tricky because the dialing into some real kind of geeky stuff the cable itself actually can pick up some signal i've been told from parsec and some of the other guys so there is some some interesting stuff where the cable can help but yeah you're talking about losing let's call it two decibels of gain for every like 10 or 15 feet of cable depending on how thick the cable if you go ultra low loss or low loss so the vast majority of our customers say hey try to get in on the 15 feet if you can if you need to extend because you're in a rural home situation and it's a permanent install you can do the ultra low loss which is really thick it's like the thickness of the diameter of like a dime like nickel dime so it's it's a thick cable and in many situations you need more than one cable if you're doing um two by two mimo or this one's got four cables right so there's four cell antennas in this we'll we'll uh we have separate videos for each of these antennas that we'll go into so we're just kind of doing an overview but but yeah so cable is something to to consider and omnidirectional versus directional so in looking at like the x-pole that uh is right here that's a directional antenna two by two mimo that has 600 megahertz support and that is a 5g ready antenna uh that's the one that's featured in chad from changing lanes video and we've sold quite a few of those to very happy customers who uh use that with um our ultimate road warrior bundle because it's two by two um it has two cellular antenna leads if you were going to look to add that to like a category 18 or category 20 modem you actually need two of those two of them um you could technically do that on two of the antenna plugs and then do kind of your small antennas on the other two um but it's not gonna be as fast as if you jump into something like this now this is a panorama antenna it's pretty big it's huge i'm not sure this is an rv application but let's let's think about what it is it's basically two of those yeah so in this situation we've got four cellular antennas in this that are all directional um this thing is an absolute beast and it screams from a performance perspective and you can use that with the 5g capable modems or the category 18 modems to just get the highest possible speed with four integrated directions i mean it's heavy it's big it takes up an entire storage unit yeah it's not not very common for rv use this is we see this a lot on uh on on those uh oil structures but this one we're very excited about yeah so if you're looking at hey i just want to step it up and i want to go think about doing pole mount to add to your arsenal again we recommend roof antenna is like 90 percent of yours but then you get out there you're boondocking and you want to be out there this is a high performing antenna we've actually got the mobile internet resource center chris and chevy from rv mobile internet testing that right now they use it at our property in new hampshire and we're highly impressed with what it was able to do that is not a directional antenna that is omnidirectional even though it's flat and it looks like you have to point it you don't so this is really really great um that's that's a four by four uh mimo antenna so there's four cell antennas in that leads here they've added really beefy 240 size cables to this to even further improve the performance of this antenna and because it's omnidirectional if you plug that into our duo type uh modems and there are cell towers in two different directions like one modem running on att and one on verizon two different towers you don't have to worry about pointing with that unit so that is what i would say is really a solid blend between not being a pain in the butt i mean still got to put it on a pole uh one little thing and performance yeah but yeah that's just sort of a simple overview of why people are even thinking about doing pool mounts and sort of the different flavors of pole mounts awesome guys well if you have any questions as always hit us up on chat you can also send us an email at info mobilemaster.com and we'll hope to see you on the road thanks guys bye [Music] you", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2022-03-02T14:00:18Z", "channelId":

{"id": "o2nimKcO4s4", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "Vx1i8BPtymwPtCt01hhOmX07Qu8", "transcript": "peplink's new max br1 pro category 20 blazing fast mobile router is here mobile must have is one of the only dealers currently shipping this device come along with us and we'll tell you all about it [Music] thanks for joining us guys and as you can see here if you look at the category 20 max br1 pro here it looks a lot like the br1 pro 5g that we covered a little while ago and we'll link to that video here that's primarily because it is mostly the identical product to the 5g with the exception that it does not support 5g bands it does support all just about all of the latest or all of the latest 4g bands however and it comes at a price point that is significantly less than the 5g counterpart if 5g isn't necessarily that important to you or if you've been following kind of the developments of the 5g networks and you you sort of know that in many rural areas 5g is not really going to do much for you at this point and the technology is still evolving tremendously and may change over time this may be an investment that's a little bit safer and a little bit easier on your wallet than going with the 5g counterpart so you might have read in the news recently that att as of february 22nd 2022 great date pick guys they have turned down their 3g networks permanently nationwide why am i mentioning 3g well because 3g became predominant a long time ago and it took them until 2022 to turn down that network now when we look at 4g and how absolutely critical lte and 4g is to the national network we can pretty safely say that 4g is here to stay for at least five and probably 10 years to come now that's a bold statement but it is based in reality in fact based on what happened to 2g 3g and what we're seeing in terms of the development of 5g nationally as 4g kind of enters its final phase of new development as they focus more on 5g what we're finding with 4g is that it's stable it works very well and the networks are using it primarily to communicate with mobile devices and to get their customers up on the internet it works incredibly well because it's been around for a long time and most of the bugs are worked out moving on to what's in the box uh pretty standard complement for a pep wave device so we've got our pep wave router we have a gps antenna that is the only antenna that will come with a cable lead believe that's a six foot lead that's attached to that we have four cellular antennas and two wifi antennas we also have a power adapter and this uses the new four pin molex power plug they have gone away from using the direct wire in this modem but we have sourced direct wire molex connectors if you want to wire this directly into a 12 24 or 36 volt system they've also included a nice little peplink branded wire management role here with their kind of signature color which is kind of a nice touch as well lastly they have updated their quick start guide which we requested that they do it has upgraded imagery as well as pictures that include the difference between sma and rp sma adapters a lot of people get confused by these because the wi-fi antennas are missing the center pin that people are used to seeing with these coax type connectors the reason why they're missing is because they're actually located on the router itself they reverse those pins so that you can't mix up the wi-fi and the cellular antennas they've covered that in the quick start guide now it's really a guide just to get everything out of the box and plugged in but if you purchase your mobilemustave.com don't worry we've got you covered with extensive setup guides to get you from out of the box to up and running man that sunlight is coming out let's add some shade so you can actually see me moving on to the modem inside of this device it has a blazing fast 2 gigabit per second max download speed and a max upload speed of 211 megabits per second it's a very fast modem it supports all of the latest lte bands that are really important and popular for each of the cellular carriers and again if you're looking for band specific information look at the listing page click on that documentation tab and that will have all the banned information but the big bands that you're going to want to think about like for att you're looking at band 14 which is the first net band or on t-mobile you're looking at band 71 which is their rural band are all included in this modem it is super fast in testing we are seeing that it's more than capable of delivering speeds north of 100 150 megabits per second almost always you're limited by the cell tower or the data plan not by this device if you're interested in detailed specifications on this device or any of our devices go to the listing page of the device and click on the independent analysis tab on that device that will link you over to gear guides or guides from our partners at the mobile internet resource center that will give you detailed specifications on the device for those of you who don't know the mobile internet resource center is in our opinion the gold standard for all things mobile internet and they've been around for quite a while providing information to members and to the public about just about everything mobile internet all right so let's move on to the physical aspects of this modem and kind of the business end of of of this device and there are there are two of them starting with this side we've got our antenna ports and these are our cellular antenna ports and our gps antenna port these are all sma connectors one two three four on the cellular and then gps at the end note that this is different than the transit devices which put the gps in the middle and i know that when i was just kind of moving real quick and not looking carefully i actually hooked up a cellular antenna to the gps and then started troubleshooting and found out that was why i was having some issues with speed so make sure you read those labels if you're interested in picking up this device or the 5g because they share the exact same chassis the br1 pro 5g over here we've got our sim card slots these are ejection spring loaded sim card slots and i'll show you a little example of how they work here they are they work basically identically to the previous generation with one exception which is that they are going to utilize nano size sims which are much smaller than the 2ff standard size sims all sim cards sold by mobilemusthave.com for our data plans or just sims if customers want to purchase them at checkout are going to be tri-cut sims that will have all of the sizes available nano is the smallest currently and 2ff or full size is the largest so you just want to make sure you don't put a small sim into a bigger device but for this device you're at the smallest size already so that's not going to be a problem a quick note on sim cards just because it does come up when people purchase and they don't see it in our instruction videos is that you want to always make sure that the notch side of that sim card is going in to the modem first and that the uh chip side or the metal side of the sim is always facing in the direction of the other sim slot so if it's sim a the metal is going to face downwards if it's in b the metal is going to face upwards uh notch always in first there is a dust cover that i'm not showing you here that's also included with this device moving on to the other side of the device we have our rp reverse polarity sma connectors for wi-fi and if you look at the antennas for wi-fi they will save wi-fi right on them so there's no confusion make sure you don't mix up the wi-fi and the cellular antennas uh we've got our two wi-fi antennas and this is wi-fi six technology and it also with wi-fi six can potentially improve battery life with devices that support newer um wi-fi six technology and it can also help with density if you're in a very dense campground with a lot of wi-fi signal wi-fi 6 can help out with that interference it also has a higher maximum throughput again you can check out the documentation tab on the listing for a full detailed spec sheet from the manufacturer or you can click on the independent analysis tab which will give you links to our gear guides with the mobile internet resource center and they will cover wi-fi 6 inside of those articles moving on we have two lan ports here and these are for connecting your local area network devices like a a smart tv potentially that you want to hardwire in or a desktop computer that's very common we don't want to typically work on a wireless connection if we can prevent it it does work but we can get a lot of that bandwidth off of our network if we can wire in the connection so it's nice that they've added two ports in here up from the transit line that only had one and then we have an assignable lan port and what assignable lan means is you can use it as wan which means it can be used as an additional input internet connection and this port is a 2.5 gigahertz port we'll get into that in a minute but specific to assignable wan you can assign this port to an additional lan port for local devices and with that 2.5 gigabit speed on that port you can start to take advantage of some super fast wireless access points like the ap1 ax that has a 2.5 gigabit uplink port moving on we've got our status lights here we've got status wi-fi and cellular these are nice lights to have your status light will remain solid green when the modem is operational wi-fi can blink when the wi-fi is on and then your cellular will remain solid when you're connected to the cellular network or it will blink if it's trying to connect or it will turn off completely if the cellular modem has been disabled this can come in really handy for folks that want to get kind of a quick glimpse or status of what's going on with their internet connection without going into the dashboard this gives you some basic functionality to know what your connections looking like lastly we've got our power port here and this is our four pin molex port that peplink is moving to on most of their newer devices now we include an ac adapter here for the 4-pin molex but you may notice that they've done away with the direct wire green sort of terminal input that gave us direct wire power access that can be somewhat troublesome troublesome for folks that don't want to cut this cable i wouldn't really want to cut that cable i'd want to have it as a spare if i went into a hotel room or something else but not to worry we've sourced 4 pin molex power adapter fuse powered adapters so they've got the three amp fuse needed for this modem and they will plug right into there and then you can wire those directly up to dc power and those are available as an option at checkout either with our bundles which it's included in or if you're just picking up the modem on its own you can select that power cord as well all right so let's talk about starlink or the future of starlink and how you can integrate them into peplink routers starlink where's the starlink there's my starlink now uh this is where really we want to talk about uh kind of what you can do with this modem outside of just the integrated category 20 modem and all this information would also apply to the vr1 pro 5g as well now let's talk about that lan port and specifically that we can uplink secondary internet connection devices like a starlink into this wan port now i want to be honest with you guys you know we're not starlink experts but we do travel with starlink and we follow the starlink news quite a bit through the mobile internet resource center so if you want to know more about starlink check out the starlink guide below but the kind of gist of what we want to tell you about starlink is it's something that's up and coming and very interesting just like all internet connectivity in innovations but no single one connection is really ever going to be your only connection i've been in this business for 20 plus years wired internet wireless internet satellite internet every internet you can come up with and i've always told my customers the exact same thing which is there is no single connection that is going to be reliable because it's not redundant so you want to always look at at least two connections possibly more in your arsenal if you consider internet mission critical all right i've done my best to tell you one thing is not the perfect answer now moving on to starlink let's assume this becomes a connection source that's reliable and is working nationally it's not there currently but we think it's coming as of right now if i get my dish working i can typically stay connected for 90 95 of the time in a one hour period it does get tricky with zoom calls and other stuff but it's really cool when it works and it's one of multiple connections that come into my peplink device we're going to do an extensive article on uplinking starlink and kind of how that all works but for right now we want to just give you the kind of high level specs on this modem and this wan port to give you an idea of why it may be a fit if you're interested in future proofing for starlink this router has a max throughput if you're looking at a bonded connection through speed fusion of 400 megabits per second unencrypted or 200 megabits per second encrypted you don't really need to encrypt internet traffic but speed fusion cloud encrypts it by default and you can't turn it off so 200 megabits is an important number but 400 megabits speed on speed fusion with a tiny compact device like this is a huge number if you're going to start looking at possibly combining it with multiple cellular connections or with something like starlink into this wan port because the router is capable of handling quite a bit more throughput than previous generation models to give you an idea like the transit series the duos that were very popular and are still very popular and are great modems those have a max throughput of 50 megabits encrypted and 100 megabits unencrypted still plenty fast and we love that for a dual modem capable device but if you're seriously considering starlink and a single modem device this is a great option and choice for you because of that faster processor the max br1 pro category 20 is currently shipping at mobilemustap.com and is included in our new speed demon vr2 stands for version 2 bundle that is currently available now there are two versions of the speed demon bundle there's the speed demon vr2 that includes this modem and then there is the speed demon 5g which includes the 5g variant of this modem both are great it just really depends if you want to look at 5g now or put that off for future to give you more information about our bundles basically what we do is we include the accessories that typically would be required for rv use to maximize the experience with the device that typically includes a roof antenna that will give you cellular and wi-fi transmission and receiving from the roof so that you can pick up campground wi-fi and cellular from that single roof antenna and greatly improve your cellular performance a direct wire dc power cable and a cellular mobile router like this one if you hop over to our store and you click on the bundles page you will see a comparison chart that will give you details of all of our bundles and the differences between them if you're interested in learning more about our internet bundles now bundles also will get you five percent off the total package price of all of those devices if you were to purchase them individually so bundles will save you some money and lastly if you look at our membership page as i mentioned before that will stack on top of the bundle discount to give you an even larger discount thank you so much for checking out the peplink max br1 pro mobile router we are super excited to be having this ready to ship today it has been fully tested by us and we think it's a great product thank you so much for

must-have insider program and we've got chris and sheree from the mobile internet resource center to help tell you about it [Music] all right guys well we're here at the 2022 escaper's annual bash and we met up with our friends chris and sheree from mobile internet resource center we thought this would be a great opportunity to tell you guys about our new membership program that includes access to the mobile internet resource center before we get into that though we wanted to tell you guys a little bit about the mobile internet resource center and who chris and sheree are so they're going to spend a second just doing a quick intro on why they actually know what they're talking about so we have been full-time travelers technomatically living on the road since 2006. so we've been doing this a long time and we got asked so many times how are you staying connected how are you working on the road how are you doing all this internet stuff that well eventually we wrote a book and in 2014 14 oh my gosh it's been a while we actually started the mobile internet resource center to make and ended up becoming our full-time jobs to share all the knowledge we've accumulated over the years with a bigger broader community and we are focused on being unbiased helping our members understand the challenges of mobile connectivity and how to assemble the right solution for them and we're all member funded and then we met up with eric of mobile must have shortly after they hit the road and launched their store and we found we had a synergy and how we approach this topic is that education and understanding your solutions and how to optimize it is key to success yeah with a tech background um i thought oh this should be pretty easy wow when you start to go mobile it's a totally different beast so these guys were actually um hugely beneficial and resourceful for us when kayla and i hit the road in 2015 and we became members and utilized that so much we were like how do we incorporate that into mobile must have so at its core mobile must have does sell stuff we are a uh e-commerce business so our insider program does include uh the best possible discounts on products that we sell on our store typically as a member you'll receive discounts that are not available to the public because you become a member and you're behind a gated community for members you get member only pricing so this new 2022 benefit includes the highest possible discounts available as well as a whole bunch of other benefits from reward points to if you go to our top tier membership the explorer you get complimentary shipping upgrades and a bunch of other stuff the membership kind of stuff is always changing so we're not going to go into all the details but if you look at the listing you'll see complete details about what is included below so that's kind of some of the you know how you can save some money stuff but we want to tell you a little bit about this new exciting feature which is the membership to the mobile internet resource center at various tiers based on which membership you choose so our resource center we have a ton of educational guides that can help you understand the challenges and selecting your rights up and more importantly assembling it so that you have success on the road and keeping connected no matter what it is you're trying to do working remotely education entertainment or just routing to find your next location we have interactive forums that are included with the full membership level where you can get support from our staff in helping you understand your setup and mobile master is now joining us there offering their more advanced tech support in our forums for all of our members which is awesome that way we can focus on the educational and news tracking side and they can help with the tech support side so yeah what we must have is not a tech support company and a lot of the products that we do sell are commercial based products that typically are installed by an i.t support company so it can be tricky and that's really why we felt that it would be awesome if we could develop a forum where we could talk about some of the more advanced features and functionalities of some of our products but instead of offering paid support to customers we wanted to be able to offer it to members so that not just the person asking the question could benefit but the entire membership community so that's where we're covering stuff like speed fusion and all sorts of other hot topics that people want to know more and more about but this also goes further it's not something that's just about when you're selecting your setup it's also helping you optimizing as you move around the country so that you're always knowing what tools and tips and tricks you need and when it's time to upgrade components as well as those data plans that are always changing we track all that stuff to help you yeah and the access to the mobile internet resource center is not a watered-down version that somehow only covers the stuff we sell we're not interested in doing that we want you guys to be informed consumers with all the information and probably 90 of some of the stuff they're going to talk about in the resource center we don't sell and that's okay we want to make sure you guys have access to all the information you can do comparative analysis and if we're not the right place to buy it you know that your membership has you covered there and there's plenty of other stuff non-internet related that you can get that mobile must have water filtration all that stuff that your benefits will still cover you for with your membership we're looking forward to welcome you into our community of mobile connected nomads across the country and we'll see you there [Music] you", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2022-02-05T14:51:13Z", "channelId": "UCE9KnGK2TcpXLlIi5cQfGvg", "title": "Membership Benefits & Overview -

{"id": "NV8PhaQVWfM", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "sCXZSC2TUSO3sKl1FRmptrLKZqo", "transcript": "hi eric from mobilemusthave.com here and we are here with caitlin again from the mobile must have customer support team and um we're going to install a roof antenna on her 25 foot travel trailer [Music] so when caitlin and i first started talking um one of the questions we ask it mobile must have is if you're going to be working remotely for us tell us about your internet setup and most of the time if they don't have an ideal setup we can help them get started pretty easily because that's kind of what we do but caitlin and her husband casey were ahead of the game and had already purchased a max transit duo pep wave router and we're off to the races going pretty strong working for a uh a another campground actually so a national campground company before she came on board with us so that's been working pretty good for you right yeah yeah we love it works great but we wanted to level up that connection a little bit and get her a roof antenna because they are looking to go a little bit farther off the beaten path and need a little bit better sell signal absolutely so here at mobile must have i think probably the single biggest concern or question we get in customer service is typically around the installation of a roof antenna it's super scary it's like how am i going to drill that hole in my roof what if it creates problems all those things so anytime i get a chance in the field to do an install we jump at it so today we're actually going to be installing an antenna we haven't featured yet on the channel which is pepwave's mobility 42 antenna which is an omnidirectional seven in one antenna it has four cellular connections two wi-fi connections and one gps connection so it's ideal for our 5g br1 pro modems our category 18 or our dual modem category 12s like the duo and the transit pro e if you're a customer that has like a br1 mini or a br1 mk2 so that's a category 6 modem that only has two antenna leads a single modem we'd recommend you look at the mobility 22g just to save yourself a little bit of money you don't need the seven and one you can go with the five and one in terms of tools what we need for the install we're gonna be doing a surface mount directly on the roof this does come with a pole mount antenna option but we're not going to be using it because they're just going to get it up there and kind of set it and forget it so to speak we're going to need a one and three quarter inch hole saw and that's going to help us get the wires down through the roof a drill obviously and then we're also going to use a 3 8 inch drill bit a long bit that's going to get us a pilot hole from the inside and from the roof down through the entire thickness of the roof before we get up on the roof a couple notes because the mobility 42 is an antenna we haven't featured on videos before a common question is does it come with a pole mount and the answer is yes it does this is included free of charge however it's plastic so if you do decide to use this make sure you secure your cables to the pole and keep weight off of the antenna we have had a couple customers and high winds snap these brackets alternatively we do sell a bracket by parsec that has a hole big enough and if you look for our doberman pole mount you can actually use that if you do break this and it is a solution since peplink cannot provide these as replacements at least we haven't been able to get them to tell us how to the second thing is this locking nut here now we're not going to use this for the installation a lot of people think they have to cut a larger hole on the inner part of the ceiling and reach up there and lock this down and that's not necessary for an rv installation the adhesive mount the dicor and just gravity will be more than enough to keep that antenna down and we have years of experience with that so we're going to disregard this locking nut and the pole mount is a good option in case you want to do a pole mount installation let's get up on the roof alright so welcome to the roof of caitlin and casey's rv and we're at the back end of the trailer here and in the rig as we'll show you here they have a compartment where a tv is mounted and that's kind of where their electrical control center is so that's ideally where they would want the wires to enter because that's where they keep their pep wave now we've looked in that cabinet and also in the inside has 12 volt power with a cigarette lighter adapter now you may find that you'll find 12 volt power in a number of different places in an rv but common places are if you have a tv antenna that is powered or boosted you can grab 12 volts off of there a cigarette lighter plug or possibly even a light switch in terms of our antenna we're doing the pepway 42 mobility series as we discussed earlier that antenna requires about five to six inches from the edge of the rv in for the hole to be drilled so we're actually going a little bit further than that we've marked our hole right here where we're going to drill our initial pilot hole with our small 3 8 inch drill bit all the way through katelyn's going to film from the inside as i drill down now one note it's kind of difficult to understand where the studs are or the the metal brackets typically that make up the framing for the roof but in reality i found that if you walk around on a roof and you slowly just pressure down on these roofs you'll typically be able to find the firm spot which is where that braces there's obviously always almost always one right at the edge and that's typically sometimes even a double and then from there in you typically have around 16 inches of hollow space which is why we've marked this location here in walking around the roof i'm actually feeling a stud again at about this location so we want to avoid that so we don't drill into metal and create a situation where we've got to get through that that metal if we go in between the two studs where we kind of feel a little bit of a softer roof area what we're going to find there is just insulation and it'll be very easy to run the wires through all right so we've got our initial pilot hole drilled through and it's right exactly where we wanted it to be now we're going to go for our larger hole which is going to accommodate the downspout here or the spigot of the antenna which is for this particular model a one and three quarters if you have a parsec antenna it's a one and a half but make sure you check the spec sheets on the diameters or reach out to us and we'll give you the recommended whole size for drilling in so this is my 1 three quarter inch hole saw bit and before i get started here i'm actually going to put that down in the hole and then i'm going to use a pen and i'm going to mark around the rubber roof and i'm going to score it with my razor blade just to ensure that when i start to cut through that roof i don't pull on this rubber roof and cause any damage to it we're going to go ahead and mark that and then cut out that aspect of the rubber before we drill down through the roof from the top and the bottom [Music] [Music] all right and that is it we are done on the roof now dykor unlike me tends to improve in appearance over time so what i recommend to people is usually touching dicor less and messing with it less is usually your best option it's incredibly sticky and for the most part if you do a bead of this and there may be some minor imperfections remember it's a self-leveling product so it will smooth out on its own over time you want to do an install like this when it's over i recommend over 50 degrees or so that's going to make sure that that adhesive 3m tape is going to get the best possible bond and on a sunny day if you can that'll just really make sure that everything levels out and gets nice and smooth and obviously on a dry day you don't want to do this when it might rain now that said dicor does say that it can take rain i think within like two or three hours of application so that's pretty cool but i typically say recommend definitely don't um don't do any dicor work if you see rain within the next 24 hours just so just to stay safe [Music] all right so we are done can't see much with this tv in the way but that was kind of a point uh but we've got our 12 volt power back here if you can see coming off through our 12 volt plug and our antenna wires coming down that we've zip tied and cable tied back and our pep wave just sitting here right here on the shelf for easy accessibility to the sim cards i think we're all set all right well we're here with harlow and caitlin harlow how's the internet it's good any questions again let's uh just remember you can reach out with info mobilemustave.com and speak to caitlin or one of our team members or go to mobilemustave.com and you can start

{"id": "qxTqmVrI18A", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "sI8RL8Qym4fzIQtYtThvXtDVqpQ", "transcript": "hi this is eric with mobilemusthave.com and i'm here with caitlin one of our customer service reps and we're so excited to see her we just wrapped up the 2022 escapers annual bash where we were sponsors and we were there helping out a bunch of customers but it's actually my first time meeting caitlin in person we've been working remotely pretty much until now and we covet test it up and we're all negative so we're going to film this video for you guys today we're going to be setting up her rig with tire pressure monitoring solutions from tst [Music] so caitlin and her husband casey are traveling in a 25 foot pole behind trailer with this chevy colorado that's uh been pulling everything pretty well right yeah yeah we're enjoying it yep so on my route out from cal or from california not california from connecticut all the way to lake havasu arizona where the event was my wife and i kayla counted 14 travel trailers like this on the side of the road with blowouts i don't know if they were all blowouts some of them might have just been flat tires but we saw a ton of stuff and it got me thinking hey caitlin do you guys have tire pressure monitoring we should so caitlin and her husband were lucky enough when they bought this rig to have the tires filled with nitrogen nitrogen is an inert gas and it doesn't tend to fluctuate the pressure of the tires very much based on the temperature of the air so that's a very good thing but it can kind of create a little bit of a sense of security because you guys checked your tires a bunch of times in the eight months you've been traveling and it's they've pretty much always been fine right right so i got to talk and i said yeah what happens when a nail hits the tire you know you may not know you have a problem until boom that tire gets so low that it shreds and causes big major damage to the rig so we're going to get her set up with a four sensor tpms system from tst today so this setup is pretty short it's not very long and they most likely don't need a repeater in this system for the tire pressure monitoring but we're going to go ahead and add it anyway just for good measure because it is included with all of the tst kits so we're going to wire up that repeater but the truck itself actually has tire pressure monitoring and it's it's a pretty good tire pressure system it's not just that little light it actually gives them readouts for the tire pressure so we're going to skip doing anything for the truck itself because they're covered there and just do a four sensor kit on the vehicle all right so i love working on these travel trailers because they're so easy to access everything we've got our 12 volt batteries right here and this is our repeater and we're just going to actually install this right up on this battery and just kind of tape it right to here and it'll be covered by the battery cover all right so we're going to use a half inch socket it could be different for your setup but for us it's a half inch to get these battery terminals loosened and hook up our repeater we're just going to mount it right here on top of the battery with some of the included double-sided sticky tape and cover it with the battery cover and we should get a red light on there to let us know it's working and then we'll be all set we can move on to putting on the sensors [Music] all right so we're all set and installed we've got our red light on the uh repeater device so that's working and caitlyn actually had a good question she said would this work if my battery box was made out of metal and the answer is maybe but not recommended so if you do have the batteries inside of a small metal enclosure of any type we recommend that you route the wire for the repeater outside of that metal box just so that it can pick up the rf reception so we've got our four sensors here and we've labeled them one two three and four uh caitlin and casey would just want to go in a clockwise direction one two three and four starting with the one closest to their door that's going to be something easy for them to remember so we're going to go ahead and unscrew the cap that came with the vehicle and we're going to go ahead and tighten on this and we will hear some air coming out and that's okay just keep turning until that air stops and you get kind of like a bit of resistance showing that the o-ring has contact with the tire at that point you want to give it about another quarter turn and that's it do not over tighten these um if you over tighten them you'll you're essentially just going to kind of prematurely wear that o-ring that's inside these sensors and then they may not seal as well and they may give you false negatives or false positives that the tire is low and it's not so just that quarter turn after you feel that it's had it's made contact and that should be it it will be fine and not come off another question folks ask us a lot is what about the flow through sensors which flow through sensors and cap sensors differ in that cap sensors need to be removed in order for you to fill the air but the benefit of them is they're smaller for this vehicle these tires have rubber valve stems as you can see here and you have to use cap sensors if you have rubber valve stems if you had a metal valve stem like with a fifth wheel or something else you could go with the flow through sensors just note that they they do protrude a slight bit more they're a little bit bigger but they do give you that convenience of being able to fill the tire without removing the sensor all right so we have videos on how to program these already at guides.mobilemust-have.com but we'll run through kind of the basics for you now that we've got our sensors installed here we've got the screen up i'm going to go ahead and hit the set button with which has a little kind of gear on it and hold that down that's going to bring up my menu and then i'm going to hit the plus button and keep going through until i see learn id on the screen once i hit see that i'm going to go ahead and hit set again and it's going to show me a display of all of the tire choices and this supports up to 110 tires so you know there's a lot of tractor trailer choices here but for us we're just going to be monitoring the travel trailer here and i'm going to use these inner front and back tires on the back just because that most closely resembles how this actually looks and i think that will make the most sense to them so we're going to hit the plus button and it's going to scroll me through all of these different tires and i'm going to get myself up to this guy right here we've already programmed it but i'll show you what it would be like if we hadn't so now that that's blinking i'm going to go ahead and hit the set button one more time and then i'm going to hit the learn button on the top here and then i'm going to hold the tst logo up i'm going to hear that beep that means i am programmed successfully and then hit the set button one more time and that's it we are programmed and good to go once we do that we can scroll through to the next tire and repeat that process until all the tires are programmed the next thing you want to do on your tire pressure monitoring solution is make sure you set up your max pressure alert and your minimum pressure alert on the device for casey and caitlin they ride these tires at about 65 psi for this vehicle so we're going to set their minimums to 55. they've got a little bit of range so it's not just beeping uncontrollably if they have a few um you know a few pounds low they're on their way to the station they're gonna see it on the screen we want it to really alert or beep when there's definitely something that they have to take you know seriously and and get get fixed right away so we'll have it set on the low pressure to 55 and on the high pressure we're going to set that to let's set it to 80. it's not typical in a rig this size that you're going to see over pressure alerts so we'll give them a little bit of a range there before the system alerts for an overpressure event all right so we're inside the truck and uh the the screen comes with two mounts you've got a standard suction mount that you can mount just about anywhere that will attach the screen or just this nice little dash mount that also kayla loves because it doubles as a phone holder when she's in the rv but we're just going to leave this here for now it does come with a micro usb charger and a cigarette lighter adapter but for this vehicle they've actually already got our four in one squid cables from mobilemustav.com and one of those cables that's included one of the ends on there is the micro usb end needed for this screen so we'll just plug it in and that's pretty much it we're all set now you don't actually have to have the screen plugged in while you're driving the battery lasts a really long time at least a drive day i think they last almost 24 hours so you can charge it overnight and then just leave it wherever and it will run off battery and do fine that way you don't have that extra cord around or you're fighting between that and your phone so we're going to leave that on the display here you can see here that we've got all four tires reading their pressure and temperature so caitlin i think we're all set my work here is done thank you so much got your tire pressure monitoring what what how how are we looking what's 64 yep 64. all right we're back to healthy and uh the pump worked like a champ so yeah love it thank you guys so much for watching if you have any questions you can reach out to us at info

{"id": "bKJQzRv9op0", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "O534jXWYLPTWCP4reDbmU4Ri7cE", "transcript": "hi this is eric with mobilemustav.com and livenlight.net and today we're going to show you the new pepwave transit pro e mobile router [Music] all right so let's get started by getting everything out of the box and showing you what's included so the transit pro e is new for the tail end of 2021 it was actually released pretty much december of 2021 and we are shipping this product right now the transit pro e is very closely based on the transit duo which was its predecessor to give you some examples here's a transit duo actually right here and you can see that they are virtually identical sharing the same uh chassis form factor and they are pretty much identical in size but there are a few key differences before we talk about the differences let's talk about similarities so this is a dual cat 12 mobile router this is very popular we're actually releasing this in our new ultimate road warrior le bundle as the transit duo is being phased out as they no longer have the components to manufacture it flipping this around it's identical to the transit duo from an antenna and a hookup perspective on the back here so we have our our dual mimo antenna ports here for modem one our dual mimo antenna ports here for modem 2 and then our dual wi-fi ports here for our local wi-fi 5 which supports 2.4 and 5 gigahertz wi-fi with the 2x2 mimo technology and then lastly here in the center we've got our gps port for location fleet tracking below that we've got our four sim slots identical as what we saw in the transit duo so that gives us the ability to to have two sim cards in both modem one and modem two the transit pro e accepts full size sim cards or two ff sim cards uh there are four slots and we mentioned that it accepts full size because some of the new br1 pro chassis are starting to come out with the nano sim technology now because this is a dual modem device just like with the transit duo we do have the ability to utilize speed fusion cloud or speed fusion sd-wan bonding which allows us to combine the cellular connections from modem 1 and modem 2 into one single bonded connection using the technology included in this modem this is a prime care modem meaning that it does come included with the speed fusion licensing for one year and then you can extend it beyond there with that speed fusion licensing you get one terabyte of data on the speed fusion cloud and you can renew an additional terabyte of data uh for forty dollars i believe the prices change a little bit but it's pretty reasonable and it doesn't require you to renew it every month it can just be renewed as you utilize the data which is a nice feature flipping the modem around to the other side there are a couple new features and differences with the transit pro e versus the transit duo predecessor the the biggest changes that we see in this modem are that it now has four ethernet ports that's one assignable wan that can be assigned to a lan and three additional lan ports the transit as you can see here was limited just to one when and one land the wind was assignable so you're getting two additional ethernet ports which is a nice touch now this modem just like the duo has an included wi-fi controller which can control external access points and while that's a really nice feature the challenge with the duo predecessor to this was that it didn't have power over ethernet or the ability to power an external access point so you needed to run power to that access point either with a poe injector or or with a 12 volt power supply so they've added poe support to the transit pro e which is a nice touch status light wise on the front just giving you a quick overview you've got your standard status cellular one and cellular two lights on the front typically what you'll see is the status light will be solid green meaning the modem is on and operational if you see it red it's typically because it's booting up and then your cellular lights they will either be off if the modems are disabled or they will be blinking green if they're trying to connect or they will be solid green if they are connected to the cellular network so it gives you a lot of kind of instant visibility on the device looking closely here at the front of the modem we see that we have our poe ready light now if you utilize the included ac adapter here that comes with the modem uh that light will light solid red and solid red means that poe is disabled now that's because the included power adapter is a 12 volt power adapter that comes with this modem and in order to enable the poe functionality you need to input 56 volts to this modem to enable poe there's a couple choices you can utilize peplink's poe 56 volt power brick but it's it's pretty big and it's designed to run on ac power so this is for 110 120 volt installation applications exclusive to mobilemustop.com we have this little guy which is sold separately and available at checkout and this is a dc converter what this essentially will do is if you take these two wires here and run 12 volts to your house batteries these two wires will then output the 56 volts which will enable the poe output on this modem what a lot of folks do is they take our included fuse dc power adapter that we sell and we have this exclusively with the 4-pin molex connector we'll get into in a minute and they pair that with the dc up converter by wiring these together so these two would go to your house batteries on a fuse and then these would go out to the modem and having that second fuse in line is possibly redundant but good for good measure just so you have an extra added fuse on both sides of the circuit in terms of your power inputs on the front of this device they've moved over to this 4-pin molex connector here for your input which is included on that 12-volt ac adapter and that's also what is included in our dc direct wire optional kit that's available at checkout the direct wire port is still available on the transit pro e which we love so you can direct wire in however they've made some changes to it it is still removable so you can pull that plug out a lot of folks don't know that's removable but if you want to take the modem out of your your rig and leave it hard wired and direct wired in and then just travel with your ac adapter you can without having to mess with the wires that's the same on on the transit duo or the pro e what they have changed however is they've removed the screw down terminals at the top here so there's no longer something that you have to screw down and they've made this a spring-loaded connection i'll admit i was a bit tricked by this first couple times i tried to figure out how to use it so just as a quick sneak peek if you have a small eyeglass screwdriver and you go into the upper top edge of this plug it will insert and that releases down the opening at the bottom here so that you can put your bare wire in once the wire is in you simply pull it out and it will lock the wire in place in terms of what connections you have here you've got your standard vcc which is your dc positive input your gr gnd for ground so that's your negative then you've got a transmission receive rts and cts for machine to machine communication if that's something you're uh you're in need of and last you've got your reset button here your pay-per-click reset if you ever need to factory reset the device if you forget your password or you just want to get back to factory default settings a quick note on this device when you enable poe you'll be enabling poe on port one of this device uh it's not going to provide poe to the additional ports so just keep in mind that you're going to be able to power one access point or security camera or other poe device with this unit if you need additional poe ports we have a 5 port and an 8 port poe option available at mobilemusthave.com if you search on our store not for the modems but for a five or eight port poe switch doing a quick overview of what's in the box it's uh pretty standard you've got your complement of seven antennas here four cellular antennas two wi-fi antennas and the gps antenna you know just because some people do get confused i will mention that the cellular antennas are sma connectors meaning that the antenna has a center pin and the wi-fi connectors are rp sma meaning that the center pin is located on the modem itself not on the antenna so if you look at these and you're like these antennas don't fit they do you just have to make sure you connect the wi-fi and the cellular to the appropriate connections and just line up those center pins and everything will connect as designed included also in the box is your standard mounting ears these can be a little confusing for folks because they include two mounting ears but there are holes for you to mount these ears either on the front or back of the unit a lot of folks will mount one on the front one on the back or what most people don't know is you can actually just remove these two ground screws in the middle and then you can mount these right in the center for a very balanced mounting application you do not need to ground this to a specific you know ground uh to your chassis you can if you want to but it's really not typically recommended for low voltage uh applications in a dc vehicle environment so if you just go ahead and get your power connections here for 12 volt power and ground you should be fine in terms of specifications this modem is virtually identical to the transit duo from a processor and memory perspective it's it's for the most part an identical unit so we're talking about a 400 megabits max router throughput each of the category 12 modems do have a 600 megabit uh max download throughput but then everything has to channel through the router which has a 400 megabit max throughput and that's all on the download side of things upload will be a bit slower but typically that's more than enough and beyond what you'll be seeing from the cellular providers at this point as with all prime care modems you do get your one year of in control cloud management included as well as i said before the speed fusion sd wan bonding license included in this device for those of you who don't know incontrol gives you the ability to look at the status of this modem and remote into the management console to administer the device when you're away from the modem itself it's a pretty cool cloud-based router management console technology from peplink the transit pro e is what i am currently running inside of my rv at the time of filming of this video we had the transit duo which has been our mainstay for quite a few years now and the reason why we decided to go with the pro e was because of those additional ethernet ports and the ability to do poe since we had this mounted up in the front of our rv that meant that i could actually uplink to our vega touch system which controls our tv which meant there was already an ethernet cable behind the tv and utilize one of these ports and then use the second port to go to an access point inside the coach if you'd like to know more about this modem consider checking out the gear guide specifically related to the transit series that's available at rvmobileinternet.com which is the mobile internet resource center the mobile internet resource center is a member-funded community that provides independent analysis

antenna mounting options to help you pick out the right one for your install [Music] for joining us guys and i don't think we've ever had this much stuff made by so many different people on the end of like christmas picking it from the shelf it was a lot of fun um the number one reason why we see we get requests from customers um about either returns or issues with antennas has to do with mounting options right you know they they buy a bundle they're super excited and then you know well i bought this antenna because i was told it was the best performance one and then they open it up and they're like how do i get this thing off yeah or even if you like like for me doing an install the antenna install isn't the isn't the hardest part it's kind of more of the math of figuring out where is it gonna go and yeah so that's kind of what we wanted to tackle is here's our options and here's your mounting kind of options within that yeah so i think we're going to start there's there's three basic types of mounts there's um a neoprene kind of pressure mount or friction mount that typically involves a locking nut uh that's very common with our mobile market antennas there is an adhesive mount which also includes a locking nut but has an added feature with an adhesive bottom or backing that's popular in our parsec antennas our pointing antennas our canine longer parsec antenna that you see here uh and then there is a magnet mount option uh this is a magnet mount husky right here it's actually looks uh very similar but has a number of different magnets on the bottom and and the pointing has a conversion yeah it can convert over to a magnet as well so we're going to kind of give you some of the the pros and cons of each mounting situation and solution all right so let's start with adhesive mount it is the by far what we would say is the most popular and the easiest way to install on an rv it's how i've installed mine which you guys have probably seen in that install video which i'll link here if you missed it yeah that was a pointing antenna in that install video but it's exactly the same method if you're going to be installing a uh a parsec from our ultimate road warrior uh plus bundles so there's really no difference to it so we'll grab this antenna and kind of give you an overview now i think what gets people the most confused about a adhesive mount installation is this locking nut now rv roofs are typically between four three to kind of four inches thick uh between the roof material which is usually you know either a rubber or a um you know a polyurethane type plastic material uh then the wood backing the frame rails that are usually aluminum and then all of the stuff in your ceiling you end up with quite a quite a thick roof and these antennas do not come with uh poles or mounting uh you know studs as they call it that are going to be long enough to get through that roof um these antennas and most antennas are going to come with i think all antennas are going to come with something that's probably about two inches long on the long side and if you play around with the canines uh it's even shorter it's a much shorter uh attachment there and that's so that you can also add a magnet mount to that canine device but the point of this is you don't need this locking nut if you're going to be doing an install on an rv you can actually unscrew this focus on uh really cleaning your roof as best as possible to make sure you've got a really good adhesive substrate either some type of alcohol prep solution they also have a roof cleaning solution camco mix one a couple others to really get all the residue off that mineral spirits can also work well depending on your roof type so check that yeah check your type but cleaning roof get it nice and clean um you know rubbing alcohol is is kind of a safe one most of the time once that roof is clean we're going to be drilling a hole in the roof i know it's scary that's a big hole oh my god that's an inch and a half in diameter that so much water can flow in there you're going to be okay i know it's scary but what i like to tell people is do you know how big the hole is underneath your air conditioner it's a good sort by foot that big and you know what keeps the water out with that a tiny little neoprene gasket that really is just pressed down there's no adhesive at all so when you look at these adhesive mounts that include 3m high strength high tensile that's thick adhesive we've had zero problems i've had an antenna like this for five plus years installed with no issues andy i don't even know the dates online yeah yeah and honestly we sell a thousand plus uh internet solutions a month we would hear about it if people were having a lot of problems so clean your roof we're going to drill a hole the diameter of this when drilling that hole you may want to call the manufacturer just to verify that you're going in a location where you're not going to hit one of those metal brace studs or wires or wires yeah most of that stuff goes through the ceiling you can run you can drill a smaller pilot hole just to check make sure you you're looking good before you go for the big big hole saw but um you're going to go down through kind of the first half you're probably going to hit some insulation like a like a pink insulation or a foam insulation and then you're going to want to go up from the other side so we typically do like a 3 8 inch drill bit to go through the entire roof so we have a pilot hole on the top and the bottom and then do the hole saw from the top and bottom down discard this locking nut just take it out take this uh adhesive press that down hold that for 15 or 20 seconds do the install above let's call it 40 degrees fahrenheit to give that adhesive really the ability to get nice and stuck down these antennas are pretty heavy and with all these wires it's going to be fine it's going to pull it down over time dogs from the warehouse say hi just for good measure to protect that 3m seal for years to come we typically recommend folks buy a bead of or buy dicor self-leveling sealant and do a bead right around the edge of the antenna just for added good metal that said just if you're doing this on a van or something with a metal roof diaper is probably not your best bet something like a silicone would work but again like on your roof surface yeah that's actually a really good point if we're not in an rv and we're doing something with a metal roof go ahead and use that locking nut that's what it's there for you can you can go ahead and screw that down for added good measure and in that situation according to the manufacturer you don't even really need the sealant at that point we just add it because it's easy to do and uh you're up there anyways it's good measure something you should have as an rv or kind of on you anyways doing your six month roof checkup so that covers uh your kind of standard rv mount now if you have an rv like me and you've got an integrated rail across the roof typically with like a gerard awning or something like that you'll see in a lot of class a's that install can can create some challenges if you install straight down on the roof because the antenna is effectively sitting down below those rails that are made out of metal and that can impact your sell signal so in a lot of those cases we'll show you some b-roll of an install we just did for a well-known well he's the president of the integra owners association um pat bauer and we just did an install for him we do not do installs at mobilemusktop.com but we did as a favor because we were in the same park for pat and he was telling some folks about our solutions but as you can see in that b-roll there what we've done is we've installed this antenna on top of a box this is a 12 by 12 inch by six inch tall box that you can get just a junction box yes junction box you get this at home depot but it is a waterproof box in the installation um when you're using one of these boxes essentially you're just raising that antenna up you can do a couple different things with the wires the wires of course on the lid are going to go straight down as you see in those photos but then you can go right through the bottom of the box and just go straight down in from there and you're you're basically done in terms of securing this you're going to want to put a nice bead of dicor around the hole below the box make sure you're really getting a good seal on the bottom of the box and then screw the box down with the included screw screw mounting ears that you see there on this box but every box is a little bit different and then you want to die core around the box as well in terms of the antenna and the lid you're going to use that locking nut to really lock it down to the lid and the adhesive mount and you're off to the races now in the pictures that we're showing you of pat's install and that's the same for mine we actually used a um a wire grommet on the side which we'll link to exit yeah side exit and that allowed us to run the cables along the roof and into his front cap and we'll show you kind of the junction box on the front cap uh it really depends on your install for integras uh the aspire the anthem the class a that include that integrated dryer awning it's a really easy place to enter your cables into because the cap is hollow and you can get right to the cabinet above the driver's seat for the install as we just showed you this is kind of pivoting us to a different type of mounting which is a side mount so while although we were putting basically that antenna directly on top of the box it created a you didn't have to put a hole in the roof directly below the antenna which is another option so we did it through the box because we just took basically a standard husky antenna on the box with the side exit there are a couple antennas that have that built in you don't need a box to achieve one would be the husky magnet mount right where this can lay flat and you can have the cables come directly out the side um so you don't need to have the hole going straight down you could just stick this to the roof and uh and then route the wires down a solar drop which i've done on my rv as well you could run it through another drop just like eric was saying with that too yeah so when you're looking i guess yeah let's move on to some magnet mount options so when you're looking at magnet people are like whoa my roof's not magnetic what do i do typically we say well first off aluminum is not magnetic so don't go buy aluminum sheeting it's ferrous meaning it's conductive but it's not magnetic so you're going to look for a galvanized steel uh sheet that you can buy at home depot or a lot of diff and they're like four dollars yeah four bucks um and typically a 12 by 12 sheets about four bucks um from there we drill four screw holes in each corner and we drill that down into the roof and then we seal the screw holes uh before we screw them down we put a bead of dicor on each of the holes and then we screw down and then we cover the screw heads with the die core as well then the antenna can just plump the magnetic right to there obviously if you have a van and you're looking at the magnetic solution these come in really handy also because a lot of vans have ridged roofs we've got kind of like water for air and these are actually adjustable so you can slide out on the pointing this one's just like there and lower the bottom of a table or a chair where you can like twist each leg to kind of get it it's the same thing here yeah this can come in really handy for those uh those those types of installations where you've got a ridged roof um this is also really handy if if you've got a ridge group it's only about four inches thick so for vans where you've got solar panels up there or you're trying to you know get between an air conditioner you've got some real tough mounting considerations this canine is super low profile and this was designed for cruisers so they didn't have any air interference of high speeds yeah so california highway patrol was saying that at speeds of 80 plus miles an hour the husky was getting a little whistly i don't think anyone's gonna be taking their rv that fast yeah but this does give you a little bit of a lower profile in those um rigs where you can kind of see the roof because they're not as tall yeah and some people just like the stealth look of kind of a super low profile antenna that's that's a fun option the last one is going to be the printing the pointing is a pretty versatile antenna too so it comes with the standard adhesive mount similar to the husky but you can also do a side or a back exit with the adhesive cables out the back cables out the back or you could do it with the magnet mount so if you had a magnet roof and you didn't want the cables going down you didn't want to use the adhesive you can buy the magnet add-ons and uh and have that kind of stick with the magnets so why is that not our most popular antenna although it is popular it does not support 600 megahertz so that can be a challenge for t-mobile customers it's it's at an exceptional price point and it works really well and it's bundled in our full-timer bundle and it has worked really well but there are some limits on that antenna by far one of our highest returned antennas is the mobile mark and it's not the antenna's fault it's actually a primary reason why we wanted to do this video now um we're not going to open this up because then we can't sell it as new but we'll show you some b-roll of what the bottom of this antenna looks like essentially it comes with a neoprene uh gasket on the bottom of it that is not an adhesive mount so in order to use this on an rv roof like the other antennas you would have to purchase some you know 3m vhb which we do sell on our store remove this neoprene with the adhesive which can be a little tricky and then cut and shape or mold your own 3m gasket it's a little tricky so typically we say is if you're really gunning for mobile mark you're happy with it it has been a top performer on mobile internet resource center uh with chris and cherie at rv mobileinternet.com they've had this antenna featured as a top pick for a long time so a lot of people are like i want the mobile mark there's nothing wrong with it but you just have to factor in those installation considering the install takes a little bit extra effort yeah this can be a really good option if you're mounting on a van or something else where you can use that locking nut yep or if you're going to use a box that's great but if you are going to just go with a straight down install on a roof you're going to be doing a little bit of work to get that adhesive onto that antenna yep so let's talk about ground planes what are ground planes do i have to ground it do i have to wire it to the chassis what is a ground no so to keep it simple a ground plane is a flat piece of metal that is mounted underneath the antenna in this case that's an eight inch ground plane by mobile mark that is designed to be used with the uh the ltm series antennas so um what does this do well it's it's not grounded like electrical ground yeah what it is is it's actually the cell signals are traveling horizontally kind of across the earth and what this does is it helps the cell signal bounce off the ground plane and into the antenna so it dramatically improves the performance of the antenna if you look at the specifications for this antenna and the performance specs it is including this if you remove this the specs go down significantly like 50 so you definitely need a ground plane yes with the mobile mark but you don't necessarily need them with all antennas um moving on the pointing says that it does not require a ground plane but there isn't asterisks on that where it says yeah but if you use one it will help improve things yep uh quite a bit so you'll get two to three decibels of additional gain if you add a ground plane to that we have installed those in quite a few installs without them and they're working fine my mine does not have one person right so if you want to add that ground plane you can you're looking at like we said before um with the magnet series getting a piece of galvanized metal 12 12x12 we sell a 16 inch round one uh and a 10 inch round one i'd recommend the 16 um and and that'll work for for those purposes but what we sell is a ground plane so it's aluminum so it's not uh magnetic so that's why we said galvanized for the magnets but you can use either material in terms of the husky one of the reasons why that's an awesome antenna is it doesn't need one it's integrated into the uh bottom of the antenna so this works great without any same with the magnet ones right magnet is integrated as well uh the canine here can work with or without it is recommended that you install that on a metal roof um however they make a pole mount and a magnet mount for that which effectively is making it a non-ground plane install so we know it does work uh without the ground plane but if you can get it in putting in like a you know i think you probably need a 24 inch by 24 inch ground plane that's a big one yeah so that antenna is really popular for folks that have metal roofs already now and just the last thing to throw in here since we're talking about mounting some of these do have pole mounting options um so while we're talking mainly roof mounting here just be aware that if we wanted to put it on a pole or do something like that for more of a rural home i would not recommend that for an rv usage dealing with poles and fitting it up and tearing it down each time you're just not going to use it as much so we don't recommend polls for rvs well i mean and at least not with these antennas there's an akita antenna we have a separate video for that which is a flat panel antenna even though it's flat it's not directional so it is an omnidirectional meaning you don't have to point it but it's just designed to be mounted on a pole it's lighter it's easier to manage i mean these are a bit heavy for poles but just to say that they do have pole mounts for the mobile mark for the husky um and the pep or the pep wave antennas which we don't have here the puma formerly puma now they're called the mobility 42 and well they are but there are pole mounting options if you wanted to go there too i think the pole mounting options are great for mobile mark and i think where i get a little worried is it's with the husky just because it's heavy it's heavy yeah so that can add some complexity or installing we get a lot of people going can i put the magnet mount on a pole and we're like no no it's too heavy we do sell a hardware kit it's called the heavy duty hardware kit that will convert the magnets back to this uh if somebody has the antenna and wants to go back and forth now one thing we don't have though is this to a magnet mount the magnet kit is sold or it's all like once they're different skews you get it you get it as magnet or you don't get it yeah so just kind of preparing it but if you guys have any questions we went over a lot of information here so if you've got questions about what might work best for your installer or rv type or what you're thinking feel free to reach out to us on chat or uh hit us at mob info mobilemusthave.com and we'd be happy to answer any questions you have thanks so much guys

{"id": "-so5R8Ptp1M", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "QZAvJnRiqcNyikbI3tK3YqYe-Ss", "transcript": "hey guys this is andy and eric from mobile must-have and in this video we're going to talk about the poynting x-pol antenna [Music] thanks so much for joining us guys so the x-pole directional 2x2 mimo antenna um is kind of a really nice blend of size and performance uh versus you know if you go with some of the larger we have some 4x4 uh mimo antennas like the panorama that are just massive so yeah this antenna got very popular with uh chad from changing lanes did a video for us on how he was able to use a directional antenna to really improve the performance when he was out on the fringe now like we've said with our directional antenna overview videos um the vast majority of our customers are going to be using our bundled roof antennas omnidirectional right on the roof set it and forget it for 90 plus percent of the time probably 99 of the time but if you find yourself in a situation where you're you know really needing a little bit extra speed or you just are so far out there that the omnidirectional antenna is not cutting it the uh the x-pole is a a great contender give a little bit more of a boost yeah uh we do recommend you look at the model that is the us version and if you look at the sku it'll end in dash 11. we see some of our competitors are selling the dash one which is a fine antenna but they're basically the same price point and if you get the dash 11 us version you're going to get that 600 megahertz support for the t-mobile rural bands so with the 5g with the 5g so you're getting kind of the best of of all worlds with that they really built it just for our market when t-mobile announced they were going to be using 600 megahertz so that is a great uh antenna for directional use uh now one thing to keep in mind with this is this is a 2x2 antenna so depending on which router you are going to get if you're looking at like a pep wave cad 18 a lot of all the 5g ones they are going to be more of a 4x4 memo and this is a 2x2 so this is a great add-on if you're doing something like an mk2 which is a category 6 a single category 12 modem this works great on but if you're doing something like the transit duo that's got two category 12 you have four cell signals and this one only has two so you're either going to need two of them yeah or you may want to look at a different option a four by four option which we have yeah so we we i would say just look up the akita antenna from parsec which is an omnidirectional we actually have it here we're not covering it in this video but it is an option if you need that 4x4 capability i'll link the video up there to that one um but yeah so it is a great it's a great option but it does depending on the router you've got there might be a better option for you so kind of think through that too performance-wise this thing and price-wise it's it's a screamer it does really well from a performance perspective and it comes in at a really nice and effective price it comes with wall mounts and the pole mounts and every all the hardware you need to mount to the pole it comes with 15 feet of cable so really everything you need is included now remember guys this is a directional antenna so you have to point it at the cell tower you can't just fire this up on a pole and you know email us and go why doesn't this work if you want to do that go with the akita yeah we'll talk omnidirectional is better if you just want to throw it up on a pole and not worry about pointing um but pointing the pointing is probably where they got their name from right um can be done with some applications like cell mapper and others and we definitely recommend you check out the mobile internet resource center at rvmobileinternet.com uh if you're looking at directional antennas they've got content about how to point antennas they've got videos um data resources forums a million different things if you're looking to really dial that in for a rural home application or if you just want to get really fast speeds in your rv and don't mind pointing yeah so all right guys if you have any questions about this antenna feel free to chat with us on our website or reach out to us directly via email at info mobilemustav.com and between now and we hope to see you on the road thanks guys [Music] you",

{"id": "JaIbog-XePI", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "_Vd2xQGAKtDH1bjnxz9-W2IBoMM", "transcript": "hi this is eric with mobilemusto.com and today we're going to talk about how to set up a network on a pepwave device to use a particular sim card or modem for its internet use [Music] now we get this question a lot because we sell cellular mobile routers that oftentimes have more than one cellular modem in them meaning you can use more than one sim card at the same time and as such some customers want to configure a network to use one sim card or another for a variety of different reasons popular use cases we see are customers want to set up a network called say streaming for example we'll use that in the example today where the traffic whenever you're connected to that network that's designated for streaming will always use a particular sim card other customers may want to use it for i want this sim card to be reserved just for when we're using when we're working for our mobile mobile work activities there's a bunch of different reasons why you'd want to create outbound policies or rules on which internet connection the device will use depending on what network you're connected to now before we get started mobilemustaf.com does not provide advanced troubleshooting and technical support as part of your purchase we do however provide videos and walkthroughs like what you're seeing in this video to get you all the way to the finish line if you are using a technology called speedfusion or speedfusion cloud that may impact how these outbound policies operate depending on how you configured speed fusion so just be aware of that that is an advanced configuration we're not covering in this video combining speed fusion with outbound policy management so just you know be aware that there's a lot going on in these technologies and these routers and you may have to find yourself on on the pep link forums and other places where some experts are available free of charge or consulting a networking administrator with expertise in these devices if you get stuck but again for today we're going to cover the basic stuff of how to configure a network to use a particular sim card so let's get started all right guys for this video we've got a transit duo here that has two cellular modems one of them does not have a sim card in it but just bear with me and we'll just assume that that modem is online so for the purposes of this video we're going to use an example which is that a customer is interested in using the cellular 2 modem for streaming uh traffic so they want to use that to you know run netflix or something like that anything streaming before we get started anyone who has already configured the modem in any way shape or form you'll want to do a backup of that configuration so let's go ahead and go to the system tab and go to configuration and go to download active configuration and save this file here somewhere safe if you get stuck or something doesn't work in this configuration and you feel like the modem is not working the way it did before and you want to go back all you need to do is go back to system configuration under upload configuration hit upload choose that file right there in my case it's under the download folder right there open and hit upload and it will reapply those settings that will get you back to where you were before you follow the instructions on this video so let's get started this is a demo unit we've got set up for a you know fake fake customer called the smith family and this is set up using our our standard wi-fi best practices and sort of standard practices so they've got if we just hop over to the ap tab they've got three networks already they're they're two gigahertz five gigahertz and their guest wi-fi and they have two networks set up already which is their guest vlan and their uh their default vlan if you don't have a guest vlan that's totally fine uh it's not necessary for this video but if you see this stuff we just want to explain that this is set up with our standard best practice documentation all right so let's get started so we're going to go over to the networking tab and we need to create a new network here and we're going to give it an ip address uh in the same range guest is using well the default is using dot 50 guest is using 51 so we're going to do 52.1 for our network and we're going to call this our streaming vlan vlan just stands for virtual lan we're going to allow inter vlan routing which is fine because this is a private network for our use and we're going to set up an ip range on the dhcp server to match that same network now if you don't know what a dhcp server is don't worry about it just copy these settings and obviously if you're you can change this 52 to a different ip range or this entire subnet as long as it's you know an internal subnet you're fine but if you're not sure what any of that means just copy what i'm doing here and you'll be fine the key here is to make sure that this 52 and this 52 are matched or these two numbers are matched or it's not going to work properly so we're going to go ahead and create this network all of their settings here our default and now we've got our streaming vlan now we're going to go over to our ap tab we're going to create a new wireless network called smith streaming we're going to change that default vlan to now our streaming vlan because we want it to use that network and we're going to apply policies to that network to control how you get out to the internet wpa2 personal is a good wireless security to use it's very secure and it's cross-compatible with a lot of devices we do not recommend you use wpa wpa2 or you will get a bunch of errors on a lot of devices like apple phones saying that the network is not secure so wpa2 is good wpa3 is fine as well but older printers and some devices have challenges with it so wpa2 is a great right in the middle of the road security protocol i've just created welcome 2020 exclamation point for my password pick something that you will remember but is also long enough and complex enough to not uh give you security problems and everything else can be left to fault so now we have the smith streaming network now my goal here is i want the streaming traffic to go out as we said before modem two now you could uh pick any modem you want but for this example we're gonna say modem two we're gonna go to advanced we're going to go to outbound policy add a new rule all right now here we're going to create our default policy here for again we're using streaming as an example so i'm going to call this my streaming policy in terms of source we're going to say ipnetwork and we're going to pick the network that we just created do not mess with the masking here this default should be fine unless you change that when you created your network which would be pretty unlikely under destination we're going to say any meaning we don't care where out on the internet we go we want this policy to work because there's plenty of different streaming platform services we're going to use and protocol is any as well under algorithm we're going to click priority which means we're going to use the connections in the priority here now what we discussed earlier was we wanted to use cell modem 2 as our highest priority so we're going to drag that up and we're going to say you know what it's okay if we use cellular one and if for some reason we had a wired internet connection that's okay too you know what let's we're going to leave that in priority 3 here but in in reality if you did have a wired connection you'd probably want to use that above your cellular connections so maybe you'd want to put that in priority one but it doesn't matter if it's offline or nothing's plugged into the wired it'll simply fail over and use the connection that's next in line here so you know what let's let's let's not say we're going to use campground wi-fi here i'm going to drag this over to not in use because we don't think that that's going to probably work very well for streaming now that's completely up to you you can change these around but just for the example here we're going to say you know what use our wired connection which is probably never really connected in an rv situation or a boat situation but it's there and then go ahead and use cellular two as the priority and then cellular one is the priority so highest at the top lowest at the bottom in terms of what happens if uh there's no connections you could down here say failover to the next role vast majority of people this won't apply because you're not going to have multiple rules that apply to the same connection so we're just going to leave this as drop traffic and this terminate sessions on connection recovery what this means is if for some reason in this example the wan uh and the cellular two were offline and it was using cell one if one of these came back online it would terminate the connection and try to get you back onto cell 2. that could be problematic if you're setting this up for like a work network instead of streaming or something else so use that at your discretion because it will disconnect you to try to connect you to the higher priority connection if you have that checked so we're just going to leave that off for now and hit save all right so now we've got a streaming policy that has been created we again have our streaming network that we want to connect to and we've created that network inside of our vlans for streaming we're going to hit apply changes and boom you are done go ahead and disconnect the wi-fi and reconnect it to that new streaming network and it will utilize the connections in the priority that you set in the outbound policy and you're good to go a reminder to backup that config if things are working the way you'd like them to make sure you do that we've covered that in the video earlier so if you skip forward you can go back and we will make sure to tell you how to back up your configuration but don't forget that step because if something happens to the modem or it needs to be replaced under warranty or something causes that to be reset you want to have that file on hand somewhere on your computer so you can get back to operation all right guys so we got through it so in summary we created a network on our pep wave device we created a wi-fi network and attached it to that network and we created an outbound policy that told the pep wave when you're on that network which internet connection to use for internet traffic a reminder guys just as we said before we're not a technical support company and we cannot provide advanced troubleshooting technical

actually travel a little bit um to a neighboring campsite and put on a new speed demon bundle for someone now we don't typically do installs here at roblox staff but i wanted to do a video one because eric is actually nearby but two to show a different type of install we've all seen the antenna i have up on my roof and this is just an opportunity to show a different type of install uh this is going to be a big class a so let's head on over there and let's get started hey guys we never ever get to do a video with andy and me in that video this is pat from the integra owners association he's the president uh we've known pat for a while and we actually bumped into each other up at uh traverse city michigan up where our warehouse is so we got to talking and he's been using a little wi-fi hotspot in his 2017 integra anthem and uh we said hey we we think we can we can do a little improvement here so uh we're gonna put in a speed demon bundle today and andy's here yeah so what we're gonna do is we're gonna walk you through basically how we installed it and show you kind of just the steps and the procedures we went through so you can make sure your install looks as good as we put this one in yeah and we are here for another week so we're going to check in in seven days with pat and he can give us kind of his his take on how things are going and working and you guys can uh hear from the horse's mouth so to speak in terms of if this stuff works or not [Music] all right so this is kind of the pre-set up for the roof box here uh pat's a bit of a a tinkerer with a background being a shop teacher in his in his former life so we want to make something very modular so modular sorry so what we're going to be doing is installing this box which is going to allow the husky antenna here that we're going to be installing to raise up over the roof rails for the gerard awning on this 2017 integra this box is going to have the antenna placed drilled through the roof cap here so it's going to sit on top to get above those rails then the wires are going to exit through this which is a modular product that we have just added to our store for this year and essentially you can add in small adapters here that have pre-configured and cut holes to add up to the exact number of wires that you need for your install the benefit of this is if you ever change out that antenna or go with something different you just change out that little module rather than having to deal with dicor and everything else to maintain the use of the box without having to redrill anything or replace anything now for this little guy we've got a unit that accepts four inputs so technically you could get up to 16 wires coming out of this one single junction box this is probably a little overkill for most folks i'd say if you're in a standard box configuration for a roof antenna probably the unit with just two inserts for these cubes it's going to be fine and if you do go with the four it's probably because you've got a solar install or something else going into the spot [Applause] [Music] all right so our roof box is prepped we've torqued down this ensured that our 12 by 12 box has its seal on there before we screwed this down and check out how nice that looks gives us a lot of expansion opportunities for the future if we need it but just a nice clean factory finish on that roof box we're now going to take this small box and prep it drill a hole in the bottom and get it ready this is going to be mounted on the front of the center cap which we'll show you when we're up on the roof below the roof line but in a way in this particular coach because the cap is above the roof line we can drill on the vertical side of that cap and get the wires down through into the coach that way so we're gonna get started [Music] so [Music] [Music] all right so we're coming back a week later we just wanted to ask pat a couple of questions about kind of really what is he experiencing that's different in the new system versus his mifi and your my fight before was on sprint and now we're on 18c so that does make a bit of a difference too um but you're mentioning some of the buffering issues and right i've had some buffering issues you know you get right into the you know high action and it it stops you get the spinning wheel yeah it's so much fun right always always climax of a movie and if you haven't had any of those issues that's that's the advantage yeah i mean really just overall now did you have any coverage issues before oh always campgrounds you know are never just out in the the highest signal strength right so when you're trying to pick up the coverage from inside your coach uh this your device puts the antennas up on the roof right yeah so it's working much better and what about like just wi-fi are you able to get wi-fi from before all the way in the back we have any issues with that always yeah yeah yeah and now with the internal access point we have much better coverage outside and inside so that really you haven't had any issues since then haven't you no right okay all right so back home that was a really good day that was a lot of work um but these you know putting in one of these units it's important to do it the right way it's important not to have leaks in the long run and to make sure stuff looks nice that's i think an important aspect of of working on this and putting in time and effort uh now a couple things i wanted to just talk about that we did a little differently than i've done in other videos is there were two new pieces of equipment now we had the transit cat 18 which is a standard piece of equipment in the speed demon bundle as well as the parsec husky which we put on a junction box on the top which is what eric walked us through now two other things we added is basically a two port poe switch what that does is that provides power basically to the pep wave but also it provided power to the ap mini which is like a wi-fi access point which you also saw that would be this piece here uh what we can do with that two-port switch is basically just add power we've got a lot of videos about it but we can add power to the pep wave and to the ap mini all through poe which is basically power over ethernet and 12 volt now if you have more questions about each of those i'll link them down below for the product listings but also we have other videos covering how they work or what good use cases are um so check those links out below all right guys that's it for this video if you have questions feel free to leave comments down below you can also chat with us on our website or email us at info mobilemustave.com and we're happy to help you all right guys hope to see you on the road bye good luck it's not wood so

{"id": "dvNVJCzi6Hk", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "0E_OVbSXsqcDEFuXcYOLPMmmVvw", "transcript": "hey guys this is andy and eric from mobile must-have and in this video we're going to talk about the parsec akita antenna [Music] i am super pumped about this antenna like and i don't usually say i'm super pumped about an antenna we've been talking with michael the president of parsec for a while and looking at a bunch of different antennas that they offer and one thing we've been trying to find is a 4x4 mimo antenna that can be pull mounted that isn't freaking massive or super heavy i mean don't get me wrong this is big but it's actually in a pretty compact case and what's even cooler about this antenna is it's omnidirectional even though it is you know flat it looks like a panel antenna that you got a point you don't um we had this in testing um you know informal testing we had chris and sheree from the mobile internet resource center up in new hampshire uh with this on a poll when we were getting pretty much nothing and this antenna was an impressive performer it honestly almost performs like it's a directional antenna you're getting very high gain specs we won't kind of geek out too much into that check the documentation tab on the store uh and it will kind of go into what this thing is capable of but it gets you some solid signal and performance i've been driving around with this antenna now normally i've got a couple antennas on the roof but when i've been in areas where i needed a little extra or couldn't quite get anything with the standard roof antenna this thing has done a good job of picking up just just that extra bit yeah if you're not sure about pole mounted antennas we have a video that kind of gives you an overview of why pole mounting might or might not be a fit for you typically this is an add-on component for most of our customers they're using a roof antenna that comes standard in our bundle 90 plus percent of the time but when they want to get a little extra performance or they're just really out on the fringe adding in a pole mounting antenna can really make the difference a couple kind of additional things this is like i said before a 4x4 mimo antenna part of the reason they got such high performance out of it is they put in really nice 240 uh cables on this thing so they really you know you get your 15 feet of cable but the quality of that 240 cable in terms of how much loss you get is significantly better than what we see on most antennas most of the weight of this is the cable yeah i mean they're they're beefy yeah so but it performs very well on a pole mount application and is within the specs of any of the poles that we offer on our store uh so one other thing we really like about this is it is a 5g ready and 600 megahertz supported antenna so if you're doing it with the t-mobile and the band 71 um or you're just trying to future proof for 5g or look at like the br1 pro 5g unit um this is a a good antenna that is compatible and we'll support you with that yeah this is a battle tested antenna it's mounted on like something like 1500 711s yeah so it's been out there for a while and uh has had a very low uh issue or failure rate so it's really just a hardened antenna that has been out for a while that just has kick butt performance because it's omnidirectional that means we're not pointing as i said before so if you're in a situation where you're in one of our dual modem setups and you've got you know 18t and verizon or t-mobile in multiple modem configurations you're not having to pick what cell tower you're picking up this thing can pick stuff up behind it in front of it to the left of it side of it it is fully omnidirectional which makes it a killer unit if you just want to fly up that pole you know and just kind of hook up the wires and get surfing or even in a house if you're doing like a rural home application this is great because it sometimes you're constrained to where you can mount it or where you can put it on the side of the house so this has one pole mounting and of course wall mounting hardware that comes with it but it just it just leaves options open for you yeah will from our technical support team has a cabin up in way upstate connecticut and uh he's in the middle of the sticks he gets no signal with a standard and he mounted this on the side of his cabin and uh talks about it all the time all the time so he loves it everyone should buy one yeah this is amazing why don't we have a video on this all right we're working on it that's pretty much it guys check out the specs and if you have any questions about pole mounting specifically we definitely recommend you check out the mobile internet resource center at rvmobileinternet.com there is a whole section of videos on omnidirectional directional pointing why antennas uh you know why pole mounting is a pain in the butt why it's great really kind of helps you dial in from an information perspective if this or another antenna is the right fit for you all right guys well if you have any questions feel free to reach us on chat on our website you can also reach out to us directly at our

{"id": "ShwXFbsysGY", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "DUnZRuJsE0tAYmyfyjvRSZq_Aqs", "transcript": "hi this is eric with mobilemusthav.com and today we're here to show you the pepwave max vr1 pro 5g [Music] so we're super excited to talk to you guys about this new modem because it's uh pretty much a full like tear down from the top down redesign by pep link pep wave um to give you some idea here's the the kind of existing or current generation br1 mk2 this modem is a category 6 modem that's been a mainstay for us for quite some time and the new pepwave max br1 pro has been completely redesigned as you can see here everything including the box the packaging everything has from the top down been redesigned in terms of packaging it looks like pep link has been busy with a marketing team uh the boxes for this series i think represent kind of where the company is going for its next generation of products everything in terms of kind of the box quality to the packaging that the modem comes into to how the antennas are bundled and packaged really makes this for us quite a bit easier to work with because their previous packaging was very difficult to ever put back in the box if you ever needed to take it out and put it back in so it's uh it's definitely a major improvement although you know it's just packaging but it does help giving you an overview of what's in the box we've got four cell antennas for that 5g category 20 when it's on 4g modem that this guy comes with and we have two wi-fi antennas that support the new upgraded wi-fi six technology that is included in this device we also have a power adapter this is an ac power adapter brick that has a four pin molex connector on it they've moved away from the barrel connector in this series we also have our standard gps antenna that has our pigtail on it same as previous generations and models and nice touch they've actually added up added in some wire management tape with the peplink branding on it as well just about the only thing that hasn't changed in this package is this little quick start guide that still has pictures from modems we'll just say are long since deceased in the product lineup but don't worry if you are a customer of mobilemusthave.com we will send you setup guides right when the modem ships so you can get everything up and running with the latest documentation and videos before we get into the deep dive of the modem itself just doing a quick side-by-side comparison you'll notice that the 5g is quite a bit slimmer uh it's about 25 slimmer than the previous model so if you are mounting this under a seat or another compact location that will come in quite handy the br1 pro 5g kind of looking at summary of what you see here on this side we've got our two wi-fi six antennas those are 2.4 and 5 gigahertz wi-fi compatible with the new wi-fi 6 standard we have a wan port uh that we're pretty used to on just about all of our pep link devices but this is a 2.5 gigabit wan port and this is an assignable to lan port we'll get into that in a minute uh we've got two more lan ports here uh so these would be for connecting your local devices and computers uh in terms of status update lights we've got status wi-fi cellular and a reset uh paperclip button just like previous models one thing to note of difference on this side is again like i said before works we're shifting away from the four pin kind of dc green terminal bare wire connector and moving to a 4 pin molex or i think it's micro molex connector here mobilemustav.com has sourced fused dc power adapters to plug into this to ease in a standard 12-volt installation so that you don't have to go through your inverter with the 120 volt power brick flipping us around to the other side of the unit we have our four cellular antenna connections here these are all our standard sma connectors uh however the included antennas now have a bit more spectrum and they are stamped uh showing that they go from 600 megahertz all the way up to six gigahertz and then lastly we have our gps port also sma connector uh one interesting change in shift which i think is uh going to be very common in the pep wave products going forward is that we're moving away from the full size or 2ff sim card and we've moved to the smaller not micro but nano the smallest size sim card in these newer modems we still have the two sim card slots just like the original modem the way that you insert the cards is identical to how they were previously you're just using the smaller nano sim form factor for mounting just like the original we've got four screw holes here so this can be mounted up against a wall down flat or even up in the air we recommend if you can mount it on a wall or flat just to allow these heat sinks to do their job as effectively as possible one thing of note it may not necessarily come into play as much in an rv but if you are looking to do some type of fleet deployment or these going to be in police vehicles or other first responder vehicles we have added the ignition sense port here which is a optional port on the molex connector that can allow you to configure certain behaviors for when the key is turned on and turned off in the vehicle to allow the modem to stay on for a period of time or to turn off immediately or turn on immediately with the key ignition if you are interested in using the ignition sense functionality our dc fused power cable does not include that third wire but we do stock the pep wave non-fused dc cable which you can use to enable the ignition sense functionality getting under the hood for a second talking specs and geeking out a little bit again that wan port is assignable to a lan port and that is your 2.5 gigabit port that may come in handy if you are looking to uplink an ap 1ax access point that also has a 2.5 gigabit uplink port that would enable that 2.5 gigabit gigabit uplink function for the vast majority of our customers to be honest that type of upload throughput is really just not something that's going to come into play on cellular networks but it is a nice feature that they've added for future proofing probably the single biggest upgrade of this unit besides a full redesign of the form factor is the processor and the throughput speeds that this thing is capable of the original br1 had a 100 megabit throughput max this has a one gigabit throughput max so it's going to be you'll be able to utilize quite a bit more speed if you're utilizing a wired internet port and using this in a failover situation where you want to fail over to cellular or if you're just looking to get the max speed out of that integrated 5g modem the br1 pro is a prime care modem so it does come with the licensing for in control cloud management as well as licensing for speed fusion if you're interested in doing wan bonding the modem has the ability to support wi-fi as when on two gigahertz and five gigahertz simultaneously and with speed fusion that means you could theoretically take that 5g modem and bond it with the lan port as well as with two instances as the wi-fi wan for a total of four connections in one tunnel that faster processor in here also means that if you are gonna look at using speed fusion you can get quite a bit more throughput out of it this specs out at a max throughput of 400 megabits unencrypted for a speed fusion tunnel to give you a comparison the previous transit cat 18 and duo's had a max through put on the unencrypted vpn of 100 megabits so quite a bit faster as 5g becomes more prevalent and the speeds on these towers improve that additional cpu speed and ability to get additional throughput is going to start to matter more and more that pretty much wraps up our first look of the max br1 pro 5g this modem is due to ship in october 2021 which is when i'm filming this video we've gotten our first demo units and confirmation that units are coming in soon so they are available on our

about our dc powered 8 port poe switch [Music] we are super excited to talk to you guys about this uh new kind of addition to our arsenal it's actually been on our store for a little while but a lot of people don't know we sell it but we recommend it a ton and we actually move quite a few of these because of how much they can do now you may have looked at some of the access points from from pepwave i've got three here a mini an ap ax light and a standard ax and these are all poe supported devices meaning that you can power these devices using this ethernet cable port so that you don't have to run the 12 volt power to these devices now we've got a full video on various power options for these devices that we can link in the description below but for today we're going to talk about the poe switch and what it can do for your setup now what separates this from your common poe switch that you can buy in just about any big box store on amazon is that this will run on 12 volts if you look at the poe switches available just about anywhere they come with a really large power brick and you have to plug them into 120 volt power and then that power brick typically puts out 56 volts in order to give 48 volts out to these ports nothing wrong with that if you have standard house power but if you're in an rv or boat situation that can be challenging or if not challenging just inefficient what's happening is you're going from 12 volts in your house battery through your inverter up to 120 volts through that power brick and that power brick's going down to 56 volts and then the ports are going down again to 48 volts it's just a lot of stepping that's going to create a lot of inefficiency this little guy eliminates that by giving you ability to plug 12 or 24 or all the way up to 48 volts input into this device and then it will output the poe 48 volts on all eight of these ports this device is an 802.af at depending on the standard you're looking for poe compatible device so it's going to work with the pepwave devices even if it's not a device you see here like the ap rugged this will power that device as well you've got a couple other features that i want to tell you about you've got two sfp ports here that's not typically going to be used by most of our customers that gives you the ability to essentially uplink fiber optics to these ports but the only reason you typically do that is you have runs that are more than 300 feet which would require fiber so that's not typically necessary but those are available there for you these eight ports are 10 100 or 1000 or gigabit speed ports all auto sensing on here from a power perspective at 12 volt input you're looking at about 165 watts so say roughly 20 watts per per port if you were going to load the entire switch up your your kind of standard ap mini here would take about 15 to 20 watts so that would work great i don't think you're going to need eight access points in your rv but it'll do it if you need to and then if you step up to one of the axes like the one you see down here those may use up to 25 watts so you'll probably be able to power let's say six ports successfully with that device if you're looking at an ip camera a lot of those are going to be poe supported so you can power an ip camera or quite a few other devices via via poe input and this will definitely take advantage of that one moving on to a few other features here one unique feature here is this actually has two dc inputs probably not going to be used for most of our customers but technically you could hook up say for example your chassis and then your house batteries one to each of these then it will actually independently use either power source depending on what's available to ensure this little guy stays online at all times it also has a standard relay plug here so it will control a relay via the integrated management console if that is something you're interested in doing to turn on and off whatever is controlled by a relay in your setup this little guy comes with din rail mounts inside of the kit as well as adapters for the side here to just do a standard wall mount going over kind of the standard configuration or way you typically plug this in you pick just about any port on this device uh say you know i'm just going to click port 8 and you'd plug the other side of this cord into the lan port of your pep link and that will uplink the peplink network to the entire switch from there you pick any of the other ports and you'll be able to plug that into that port and then to say an access point or a security camera and that all will exist on the same network these devices are all you know ieee standard devices so if you plug in a device say a desktop computer that doesn't support poe or just doesn't need the power that's totally fine the switch is smart enough and the computer's smart enough to know to just disregard the voltage on that line it will not create any damage to those devices the three pins that it uses for power um are not the same pins that are used for network traffic and that's what kind of poe plus is all about and that it auto senses the ability to turn off or turn on the power as needed so whether or not it needs poe or not you can use these ports to fill them up to plug in various devices this can be very useful for example if you have smart tvs or maybe your media cabinet is near your television and that's currently connected wirelessly almost all those tvs actually have an ethernet port on the back and then you can wire in the tv so it doesn't use the wireless that'll free up wireless bandwidth for your other devices and probably make the tv a little bit snappier with response times and whatnot when using the television because wired is always preferred over wireless if you can run the wires if you have any other questions you can always start up a chat with us at mobilemusthave.com or you can email us at info

our 12-volt poe injector [Music] we're super excited to talk to you about this little device um you know to give you some kind of backstory on poe a lot of the pep link devices that we sell don't have poe output but most of the access points are kind of all the access points in the peplink lineup if you're looking to add additional wireless coverage support being powered over ethernet so we're like okay well then maybe we should just get poe injectors or poe switches to provide power to these the problem with those devices is that they don't run on 12 volts they almost all require a large sort of ac adapter that down converts them down to 56 volts so you have to have your inverter running all the time for them to function that's just power kind of inefficient you're taking 12 volts from your house batteries you're up converting it through your inverter to 120 volts and then you're down converting it back to run that switch at dc power again so this device solves that so we're going to show you a little bit about what it can do okay so let's kind of look at this device and on this side we've got your standard kind of 12 volt input this device will take dc power inputs and you can use our standard fused dc power adapter that we sell as an option with this kit although we do recommend you pop in like a 10 amp fuse just because this device is going to put out a little bit more power than our standard 3 amp fuse that comes with that wire but you do have the ability to use our feral terminal connectors to plug right into this and our fused connector for our standard automotive fuse input once you put that 12 volt power and that's going to power up this device you will see 120 volt input over here that's typically not used in an rv but it is a secondary input source so you could plug it in to just a regular ac power and it'll act like any old poe injector but for this video we're going to focus on the dc power input because that's going to be the most efficient to keep us from needing an inverter once we power that up that's going to enable our two ports here our data input port is where it's going to receive information from so this would typically go into the lan port of your peplink device and then this port will pass through that lan port but also inject the 48 volts of poe power to power the access point so now we can go from pretty much any of our pep link devices out the lan port into here and out here to power that access point without needing an inverter so we're super excited about this and it comes at a sub 100 price point this little guy has a few more tricks up his sleeve so you might be wondering what this sort of pigtail is here is and that's a barrel connector that has the same size plug that the input on peplink devices takes and this outputs 12 volt power so if you're going to mount this near your pepwave device you can have one single input to your house batteries you can then power your peplink with this pigtail and then you can in addition to that output 48 volt power here to internal access points all from one device that really cleans up the amount of wires that you need to run and the amount of fuses that you're going to need to keep this installation safe going even further this over here is a 24 24 or up to 48 volt additional dc output i think they were just figuring oh maybe we can get more outputs for our customers that's pretty interesting um typically for our customers they don't we don't have a lot of accessories that run on 12 or i'm sorry 24 or 48 volts so that may not be needed but it is an interesting additional benefit with this little unit just wrapping up this guy does come with your standard kind of 120 volt power input cable there as i said you've got your 12 volt input here and it also has a din rail mount here if you're interested in mounting this on a wall using a din rail mount system it also has the ability on this side to mount the device using standard screws just to kind of lock down wrapping up you've got three lights here you've got ac bat and charge now charge this does it have a is it charging does have a battery that's typically not going to be used for most of our customers but i'll mention what the feature is just so you guys know ac means that the power is being brought in from the ac power port battery would mean that the power is being brought in from the 12-volt connector now if you this is typically not going to be something for our rv customers but this is a feature for certain solar installations if you power this device via the 120 it will actually reverse feed or trickle charge out of the input wires to the battery to kind of basically turn this into a bit of like a ups or a controller where it will power the house batteries or charge the harsh batteries now that's typically not needed in rv installation because you have your own charger or inverter charger in your setup and these are going to be the only wires you use meaning they're going to be input wires so we're not going to use that for most of our installations we're just going to use that and that will give us all the features to power up our pep wave access points if you guys have any questions or concerns you can always start up a chat at mobilemusthave.com or email us at info mobile must have dot com as well thank you so much for

{"id": "gmYu_TUbMR4", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "1gx1RVX-2TQ8XkF6KTyUShphIKo", "transcript": "hi this is eric with mobilemusthave.com and livenlight.net and if you're thinking about adding a secondary access point to your mobile internet setup there are some power considerations on how to get power to these devices come along with us and we'll show you what your options are [Music] all the access points you see here today as well as the ap rugged and pretty much all the pep wave access points have two power input options that can be used the first is a dc power input and the second is something called power over ethernet which means that the access point can have its power delivered via your standard network cable so let's start by talking about dc power input options for pap wave access points now most pep wave access points have a barrel connector on them a small dc power input like the one that you see here and you can use a barrel connector to provide power to the device now it's important to note that peplink access points typically run on 12 volt dc input that's very useful in an rv or boat situation because most rvs like the one we're in right now operate their dc power systems for instance the lights that you're that i'm using right now to to light up this room all run on 12 volts if you're looking to power one of these access points via your 12 volt electrical system then we recommend you look at our dc power cable and barrel connector which is an accessory available at checkout on each of the pages for these access points that cable will give you this barrel connector along with a cable that is 10 feet long that includes a 3 amp dc fuse that will make sure that the access point is properly fused so that you can then connect it directly up to any 12 volt source that you have in the rv or boat now if you have a yacht or a larger boat make sure you check what your dc power system runs on because it may be a 24 volt or possibly even a 48 volt system these access points do not support 24 or 48 volts the input maximum is 12 volts for these devices for the vast majority of our customers they're probably going to be looking at an ap mini option or an apax light option these are great for rv and boat use because they combine really nice small size with high performance and speed the ap mini here comes with a power adapter but the ax lines do not and even though they do come with a power adapter the power adapter they come with runs on ac power or 120 volt power it has a you know a wall brick like you see with most devices that are designed to run on home power that brick or wall brick is actually just moving the power down and converting it from ac 120 down to 12 volt dc you can run with that ac adapter and you can actually buy that same adapter and i'll put the part number below to run the apax devices as well but if you're in an rv or a boat situation typically you have 12 volts all around you so there's no need to go from your 12 volt house batteries up through your inverter to 120 and then back down to 12 volts it's very inefficient it's much simpler to simply hook up these directly to your 12 volt house batteries so that covers dc power input and the two options available option one is you can get the 120 volt power adapter again i'll put that part number down below that converts from standard ac power to a barrel connector that will power these devices at 12 volts dc or if you want to wire directly into your house batteries and skip the 120 volt which is what we recommend go ahead and get the optional dc power adapter at checkout okay so now let's talk about power over ethernet or the ability to provide power to these access points through a network cable basically if you plugged in a network cable like that and had a poe capable device that could send power to the access point that would be all you would need to power up the device you would not need the dc power cable that we discussed in the previous option now the challenge with peplink devices specific to the devices that we sell in our bundles and our kind of most popular models is that they are not poe capable they don't have the option to pass power through to these devices to power them why you ask well it's typically because those pep wave devices are fairly small and in order to provide poe you have to take some a 12 volt power input source like a house battery and poe runs at 48 volts so you have to up convert that voltage in order to do that i'll keep it brief but the long story short is in order to up convert voltage you need a a larger case for that converter to be able to do that and that's something that peplink typically cannot integrate into many of the mobile routers specifically the ones we sell on our store but don't worry we have some options these two specifically that we're going to discuss with you right now so let's start with our first kind of most basic but feature-packed poe device that can provide power over ethernet for your access points and that's this little guy it's called a two port switch but i like to call it a poe injector what makes this different for most poe injectors is that it accepts 12 volt dc power input and then it up converts that voltage to 48 volts all inside this little box here so if you provide fused dc power to these two cables here it will then output 48 volts here to the access point to power up the access point now you could just power up an access point anywhere in the coach and uplink it wirelessly to the pep wave or if you can we recommend using this data port to connect to the lan port of your pep wave that way that access point will be connected via a wired ethernet connection which is optimal for the best performance of your wireless access point this little guy has one extra feature up its sleeve that's pretty unique in that in addition to being able to provide the power over ethernet for your access points there is a pigtail here that has a barrel connector on it and this is a 12 volt output this can actually be used to power your peplink router why that's interesting is if you ran one set of 12 volt power cables to your kind of network area you could then have an output here for your access point and you could have this output to power your pep wave device so you wouldn't need multiple 12 volt inputs the device also has an additional 24 or 48 volt power output on the side here if you need it not typically something you'd need but technically you could power another device as long as it supported 24 to 48 volts now the downside to this device is it only has two ethernet ports if you're adding one access point and that's it that's fine you're all set this is a great device and it's in a sub 100 price point so it's a really good option but if you're looking to add additional wired devices for example additional access points maybe a poe capable security camera or possibly a desktop computer like this that you want to wire in to additional uh or you just want to wire into your ethernet then you may want to look at our 12 volt poe 8 port switch the 8 port switch version operates very similar to how the 2 port version works it just has more ports so on this side you've got your dc power input that will take 12 to 48 volt input technically it actually has two inputs so if you had two battery banks like house and chassis it'll it'll accept two different battery sources and pick from either one if one battery is uh having an issue not typically needed but it is an option there and then that's going to output to these eight ports that are all poe capable uh at 12 volts this will output about 160 165 watts so let's just call that 20 or so watts per port a typical ap mini like this will out will take up about 20 watts so you could technically add quite a few access points a security camera would be probably a little bit less and if you wanted to go with an apa-x it would probably be closer to 25 watts or so so you probably could support up to six ports now one thing to note if you have a non-poe device that you'd want to plug into this like a desktop computer or maybe you're uplinking to some other part of the rv or coach the switches are smart enough to know okay that's not a poe device and it will not damage those devices it is a network standard ieee standard so all devices kind of understand how to interface with poe enabled switches okay so in review we've got two kind of main ways that we can supply power to our access points we can go with 12 volt power which can either come from a kind of our standard ac power adapter that converts to 12 volt dc that you could run on a standard house plug that would need an inverter you could run a dc straight dc fused dc plug at 12 volts with a barrel connector that would plug into one of these devices and power it up that way or you can run power over ethernet either with a two port injector here or with a larger poe switch that will give you added expansion and functionality whichever one is best for your needs it'll work and thank you so much for watching guys and we'll see you on the road [Music]

mobile must have wireless [Music] now mobile must have wireless we are focusing on hotspot plans to fill the need in the mobile internet space a lot of us have gone through uh the challenge of finding good hardware already to work or just kind of relax in modern style having internet resources anywhere we want to go in rvs and boats and lots of other devices and other vehicles but the challenge has always been getting a good data plan carriers uh up to really up to date have not offered good unlimited plans recently and you could go with a reseller but those are always a little sketchy a little gray market and you never really know what you're getting are you getting a tablet plan that's just been kind of reversed or re-engineered to work in a hotspot you never really know and then they shut down all the time you see a lot of that um coming up on forms and stuff so we have created a new really stable certified plan that uses our own segment of the network that really offers a great solution now this is a high gig plan that will work for just about everybody and get the amount of data that you need of course we always recommend having two networks so that does not change my answer there we still recommend two networks but this is a really solid option either as a primary network or if you already have a good primary network potentially as a backup network another really great thing about this plan is since we have offered not only the hardware and now the data plan you don't have to deal with going to multiple places to get support have you ever been in the situation where you're having an issue getting something connected and the hardware team says it's the plan problem but then the plan from provider says now everything's set and it's a hardware issue and it's just this constant back and forth since we're able to not only support hardware for you directly and we have offered the plan directly if you've got those together you're talking to exactly the same team the whole time uh so from a support standpoint we're really excited about solving a lot of those problems um and if you're just new and looking for a good internet solution this is now a really good option you can buy all the hardware inside one of our bundles which is designed to have the mobile internet uh kind of router and modems for you with the white roof antenna to kind of optimize your performance there with all the cabling you need and now you can add this great data plan option to your cart with one checkout and you are done that means basically the time you are unboxing and plugging everything in you can have an activated plan on a great network and be fully tested and fully up and running if you're looking more into this plan i'll give you a couple big highlights about it we are allowing you to pick your own activation date so you can purchase it today or whenever you're ready but not activated until you really need it or are ready yourself so if you're planning a vacation a couple months and i'm just trying to kind of get everything together and everything collected you can do that but not be worried about burning months of data you're not ready for if you're leaving in a couple of weeks you can buy everything now set everything up and then turn it on once you're ready we do activations just about within 24 hours try to do it same day a lot of times um so once you get everything ready and you're ready to have that activated you can request activation and we will get that plan up and running for you very quickly these are all great alternatives that you don't get with a lot of carriers or even reseller plans now finally when you are getting this plan and you are setting it up you are going to have to change over to a custom apn this allows a little optimization of kind of that part of the network this plan also has no contract so you can uh sign up for it at any time you can cancel at any time and if you ever want it to come back so you kind of go out every couple months you can come back you can sign up for the line again we can activate you um and you can come back so it's month to month if you just need it for the summer if you just want it for the year or so you plan to go out this is a easy plan that you can turn up and turn down when necessary for a lot of reasons this is now a really great option and a really great data plan to put in your repertoire of data plan options when you're on the road now i just want to go over a quick like 30 seconds on how the activation process works for this plan once you purchase the plan with or without hardware and you follow those instructions once everything has shipped out to you we will send you an email with next steps and that email goes over a couple couple different things kind of high level and in there is a form to fill out to request activation you can sit on that until you're ready but once you're ready you'll fill out the form that you're ready to be activated um and our team will go in and activate the sim card that comes with that planet that's this plan includes the shipping of the sim card to you uh once you get an email that we have activated it for you come with next steps basically going to put the sim card in fire up the device there is instructions on how to change the custom apn setting and once you've changed that apn you are online and ready to go overall we are really excited about what this plan brings to the mobile internet space as these plans are very hard to find and it's very hard to find a good stable legitimate option if you have any questions feel free as always to email us at info mobilemustam.com you can also chat with us live on our website and we're happy to answer any questions you have about this plan thanks guys and we hope to see you on the road bye [Music] you", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2021-09-24T13:00:11Z", "channelId": "UCE9KnGK2TcpXLlIi5cQfGvg", "title": "MobileMustHave Wireless is Now Available!",

from viair and the 450 rvs from vire and figure out what's the difference really between the two and which one might be the right one for you if you're trying to figure out which one you want [Music] now viair has a whole lineup of different tire inflation devices they've got lower end ones for smaller applications like vans or cars it's going to be the 89 you also have the 300p rvs which is a little bit more designed for the towables you still get pretty good high psi with that but you don't have quite the full duty range you're gonna get with these higher end models you also don't get all the accessories that you get with these uh these units actually have the same accessories so you're gonna get those two long extension uh kind of air cables you're gonna get the really nice kind of handgun um type of action with two different um connection points if you want the gas station style air pump with like kind of a straight front and back air filling option you've got that too but my favorite one is actually what we're going to call the knee saver where you can actually screw it right onto the tire it's a flexible cord it's about three feet so you can actually stand with this and still check your pressure and put air in the tire i think it's actually my favorite feature of this and definitely the one i use the most but from an accessory standpoint like i said these units are going to be virtually the same where the key difference is is kind of the insides of the compressor that's used to put air into the tires the 400 surprising is actually a little bit faster on specs if you've noticed um over the 450. it has a little bit of a bigger diaphragm basically so it's going to push a little bit more air through the drawback though is it does create more heat so you have a shorter run time overall so you have about if you're at 100 or plus psi you're going to have a shorter run time of about 20 minutes max before you need to let it rest and cool off the 450 actually doesn't have the same diaphragm it's going to be a little smaller so it creates less heat and because of that it can actually run longer and i'm talking a very slight change in speed of air going through but in exchange you can actually run it basically forever without it overheating if you're at 100 psi or lower if you go over 100 psi you can run this for 40 minutes and then it asks for it not to overheat so it wants to rest at that point they're both really good units it just kind of depends on if you're doing something more like a trailer and you want kind of all the features and your max tire is at 80 psi or anything really under 100 the 400 might be enough for you and that's a great option if you've got tires that are over 100 psi and you might be filling them up a lot especially like this class a behind me it might be better to go with the 450 because you won't really ever have to turn it off and let it rest in weight so you can fill up more tires if let's say you're seasonal and you're leaving and all of a sudden you've noticed everything is low both of them are super great units um it's just going to be the runtime that's the main difference now some other key things to mention about these pumps that really make them i think above all the other ones we've tried on the market is they are so quiet if you compare this to another kind of compressed you might have heard in a commercial garage or you might already have a different one these things have mufflers on them so they're really quiet so we have filled up in campgrounds and i've never been worried about disturbing people from excessive noise or anything which has been nice especially if you're leaving early and you need to fill up your tires you're not going to be waking up your neighbors and the other thing to mention too is you'll see in this part of the video i'll show the range of how with one cable i can hook the actually the power up in the very back of this class and it'll reach all the way to the front tire with one hose of course if you need to go to the other side you could uh you know use the second hose i never even actually connected the second hose to reach all tires of this rig even if it's towing its car behind it and a lot of class a's will have will even have batteries on the front and the back so you might have your house battery and your drive battery in different locations so keep that in mind too um i know for my fifth wheel we're 60 feet uh bumper in a bumper um and this has always been able to reach typically with one hose but i could leave and kind of be lazy and with the two hoses and get to everything and not even have to move the compressor at all so it's just really convenient and it comes with everything you need all right guys if you have any questions on these units or any other units or really anything mobile must have related as always you can leave a comment below but it is best to email us at info at mobilemustave.com or you can chat

{"id": "0wBfCA_EXqI", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "jQmxe70CZ8shRuJnSejUg8a3B98", "transcript": "all right so hi guys this is andy from mobile must have and today i'm excited to talk about a new product launch that me as a full timer i'm really excited we're finally carrying and today we're going to talk about the vi air air inflation systems now there's a bunch you can do with these and as a full-timer as i mentioned this is something i have had on board with us basically since we left three years ago so i think it's a really important product just in general to have i'm really excited that now we carry it and i want to show you everything it does and why this is such a good thing to have on board [Music] now we've been selling tire pressure monitor systems for years and that is also something that's really important to have a tire pressure monitor especially the ones from tst which is the ones that we like the most will tell you if you're having a real-time issue with your tire so if you're driving and you lose pressure or one is overheating there's a lot of things that can tell you it's really great but at times you're not always able to fix that immediately and this is where some of the fire solutions can come in to make sure that if you're running low on pressure and possibly going to have maybe a tire issue you can fix it with a vire pump now via has a ton of different ones and this is my personal one that like i said i have had on board for at least three years now so i'll take you through the lineup of all the new ones in just a minute but what we really like about these is if we're ever having an issue or if we're pulling out of a campsite that we've been to for a long time um we can fill up our own tire pressure and this is for class a's class b's class c's trailers fifth wheels even you get everything you need to really make sure you are self-sufficient and not going to be stranded just because of a simple tire issue the system comes with basically everything you need right inside you hook it up to either a truck battery a car battery the rv battery you can fire it up and get your tires to pressure when and where you need to another really great thing even if you're not a full-timer and you're maybe more of a seasonal or weekender is you can actually use the vire system to blow out your water lines if you're storing this over the winter you don't want anything to freeze you can use this system as that air compressor to blow everything out so you don't have to worry about water lines freezing or using any chemicals so not only are you potentially getting a tire inflation that is one of the unique ones it can actually go up to 80 and 120 psi and an rv tire but you're also getting a tool that can save you money long term with just doing winterization all by yourself now i would like to take you through kind of a high level of each particular unit what is great about it kind of what makes it stand out or why it's different than the other ones and then talk about accessories and also really which one i ended up selecting a couple years ago and how that's turned out for us over the three year time frame we've been full time i will start quickly with the 89 it is a great unit for smaller more like vans and class b's that's what this one kind of the range is for it goes up to 120 psi it only uses 20 amps it goes right onto the battery it's very lightweight overall um and it's a great option it's got a 20 foot kind of extension cord so it can go anywhere within that van one one quick thing though is it doesn't work well with dual tires so if you've got a class b with those dual tires in the back uh just kind of check you might be better going off with a slightly higher model just to make those connections easier for those tires still though solid option really great for the garage if you're just kind of wanting to have a tire pump for your cars and just around for bicycles all that kind of stuff this comes with all those kind of standard accessories for air inflation great option now the next one down is going to be your 300. uh vire has that kind of tagged for towables uh the design changes a little bit where now you have your psi reader on uh kind of the hand tool um you've got one extension cable so you can reach from either your tow vehicle in the front all the way to your back tires uh or if you're using like a house battery you can get to all of your tires that way too a really great option it does go up to kind of like the whole metal inside the actual compressors and stuff so it's a little upgraded in that design um and it's still a really good option now the 400 and the 450 are pretty similar um the 400s are going to be designed for the class c probably even small class a's will work well with this and then the 450 is designed for those bigger class a's now really the main difference is going to be how long the run time can work on this and how fast it fills your tire it's very similar compressor almost all the accessories are identical in the 400 and 450 the main kind of thing is is do you want to have a faster tire fill and you know do you want just to have just a little longer run time if needed um this one's great this one runs easily for 20 minutes without overheating so for most people this is going to be a fine option if you're in that class c with those smaller tires um if you've got the big tires or just want a little bit of extra oomph the 450 can't go wrong with that one either you could even have a 450 if you've got a towable or a b you're just looking at a bigger size kind of a bigger compressor it will work all the way down you can't necessarily go up so you couldn't necessarily do a class a with the 89 this just doesn't have enough oomph alcohol enough power to really get those big tires up all the way up to probably normally 120 psi but it's great for going to be like more residential tires and those lower psis like in the 50s and 40s range uh you can the towables goes up to 120 um remember you're maxing out that compressor so that's close to where your tire pressure is um that's okay my fifth wheel runs at 80 as does our 3500 truck um so this would definitely work for the fifth wheel situation now the one i went with uh three years ago was actually the 450 at the time we had a class c and i just wanted a little bit longer of a run time we had a tow dolly so we had just so many tires we were managing and it just always seemed like one tire needed some amount of air and i just didn't ever really want to worry about it so we went with the 450 and it has held up remarkably well i have done zero maintenance to it we use it probably three times a month some tire here or there needs air some sucker ball needs air a bike tire who knows i've used it on everything now the last thing which i'm really excited about is going to be this winterization kit this works with the 450 and the 400 and i believe it works with the 300 we'll check the listing for that uh but this means you can blow out your entire rv airlines in the winter uh using your pump so if you already have this tire inflation device you can use that to build up air pressure and then blow out all the water in your rv so you don't have to use any chemicals or take it to some place that has a compressor this can now do that for you this is a great little add-on that you can just you can keep on board and when you need it you've got it so there's gonna be a quick lineup uh we're gonna do like i said box opening videos for each of these talking about how they work and showing you um kind of a quick demo of each one uh if you guys have any questions as always leave them in the comments below uh it's better to shoot us an email at info mobilemust-have.com or chat with us on our website directly there's always a human there to talk to you all right thanks guys we will see you on the road bye [Music] you", "snippet": {"publishedAt":

{"id": "gLQDyQlDFfo", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "vj0reIQCpR2H9lBCXFA442wGa8A", "transcript": "one hi this is eric with mobilemusthave.com and livenlight.net and today we're going to show you a bunch of access points that you can add to your mobile internet setup to increase your coverage and speeds of your wireless network [Music] all right so let's get started now before we get into the various models that we show here we kind of want to talk to you about the use case or the reason why you may potentially want to add an additional access point now most of our mobile router kits come with a roof antenna and most of those roof antennas support wi-fi transmission so if you buy a pep wave router from us there are cables that go up to the roof and that roof antenna is primarily where you broadcast your wi-fi from why is it on the roof so that you can also use that same roof antenna to pick up signals from campground wi-fi for example or you know walmart wi-fi or starbucks or whatever else or possibly the wi-fi from your house if you're parked next to next to your house for a period of time when the rv is in storage the downside of using that roof antenna is that because you're transmitting from the roof you may in some occasions or in certain rigs have challenges with certain spots in your rv having adequate wi-fi signal now to be clear that's not typically the case the vast majority of our kits will broadcast from the roof and can function fine without adding additional access points that said some rvs have materials in the roof or certain types of insulation that might you know contain a metal or foam kind of barrier that could potentially interfere with wireless signals and in those particular cases your pep wave router has the ability to add secondary access points which will transmit the local wi-fi or local wireless signal from the pep wave again inside of the rv to increase your signal these guys can also be very helpful not just for increasing signal range but also if you have a lot of devices now typically our bundles will support upwards of 20 30 devices but as people start to have smart everything's whether they're watches or phones or tablets or tvs or you know wrist you know health monitors there's so many different smart devices that are connecting to your wi-fi adding an additional access point can give your wireless network the ability to support more clients or devices all of the devices here support up to 16 ssid or wireless network names which is quite a bit of step up from what the routers themselves support which is a max of four so if you've got an interesting configuration where you need a bunch of different networks and you want to segment them off to different vlans like the kids network or this network adding these access points can give you a lot more than just a four that you can create standard with the router alone there are additional videos on how to power these devices and also how to connect these devices should you decide to add secondary access points those are in our guide section which you'll get access to after purchase so that you can set everything up today's video is really just an overview of the products and their features now all of these devices support 12 volt power input meaning you can power these guys up using your house batteries or the ability to use power over ethernet meaning they'll be powered by your sort of standard network cable we have various power options and a video specific to power also included in our series about this that should be located on the video or documentation tab in our listings let's get on to looking at these devices all right so let's get started with our ap1 mini this is probably well this is definitely one of our most popular access points for rv and uh and boat or kind of van life use um this is a great little guy it's actually kind of claim to fame is that it's uh one of the smallest access points that has wi-fi five technology which is pretty fast this device is designed to support up to 60 or so clients per device so it's got quite a bit of of capacity it has a maximum data rate or transmission rate of 300 megabits per second on the 2.4 gigahertz or 2 gigahertz what is commonly known as wi-fi spectrum or 866 megabits on the five gigahertz wi-fi spectrum that's a lot of speed um in a very very compact little case it has this um sort of mounting bracket here that can be used to mount it to a wall or to a ceiling and on the back of the device you've got your network input here your gigabit that's one gigabit input here and your 12 volt power as well and again this can be powered with poe even though this little guy is only about four inches by four inches in size it packs quite a bit in terms of power it has a decent amount of range inside of it that can seriously increase the wireless coverage inside of your setup if you have one of our transit based bundles like the ultimate road warrior or the speed demon bundles the wi-fi transmission power in that device is about 17 decibels and it's coming from the roof so it's got to get down into the rig these transmit um to this wi-fi five it uses a little bit more decibel gain this has got about 20 or 20 looking at the spec sheet here 23 decibels on the 2.4 gigahertz which is a lot of transmission power there are two antennas in this meaning that it can actually simultaneously broadcast the devices in two different data streams to increase the speed using that wi-fi five technology this little guy can broadcast simultaneously at uh bgn which is kind of the different types of wireless or ac a n which is the newer style technology common with wi-fi five so it can it can do quite a bit in a very small package and what's even better about this little guy is it comes in at a very attractive price point even though it's small at under 199 moving on we're actually really excited about this because this is the newest addition to the pep wave lineup for access points this is called the ap1 ax light and we're going to get to this big boy in a second but i'll bring it up and show you this actually came out um not too long ago and this thing is a monster and it's awesome and it is incredibly powerful we'll talk about this next but to give you some comparison comparison perspective when it came to any type of mobile use people were looking at this nearly two pound nine inch by nine inch beast and it had some challenges around uh being used from a mobility perspective so they came out with this which is the ax light now when we step into the ax series we are stepping into a new wireless uh standard called you know named wireless six it's also 802.11 ax which is the newest wi-fi standard as of mid-2021 some benefits around the ax standard it in with supported newer phones and devices it can improve battery life for certain newer phones uh like the newer iphones and some of the newer samsungs etc because it runs a bit more efficiently but more commonly what kind of folks like about the ax is that it can support more devices across a single channel or wi-fi spectrum so you can kind of have a lot more density of devices while maintaining higher speeds on all of your devices now typically for most rvers the little uh ax i'm sorry the aim the ap mini is going to be more than enough to handle the speeds that you're going to see in cellular or campground wi-fi networks normally the bottleneck you're going to see is actually the internet speeds not the wi-fi speeds but with an ax device like this a uh with the ax light you could benefit quite a bit if you're doing any type of youtube blogging or any type of file transfers where you're transferring large files in between multiple devices in your rig or if you just have a lot of devices the ax lite could be a really good option for you diving into the specs for a second the 2.4 gigahertz range on this supports 574 megabits of speed and the 5 gigahertz supports 1200 or 1.2 gigabits of speed that's a lot of wi-fi speed out of an access point so very very fast throughput on this device flipping it over you've got pretty much the exact same inputs you've got your standard one gigabit ethernet input and your 12 volt power input you either you don't have to power it with a 12 volt if you have poe as mentioned in the mini device talking about antenna configuration in here you've got two antennas on the 2.4 gigahertz and two antennas on the five gigahertz which can operate simultaneously to give you those higher throughput speeds that we mentioned earlier these are also three decibel gain antennas inside of this unit so that's going to help you with range to your devices stepping up from kind of more closer like a two decibel gain antenna in the mini so if you're if you're having some coverage issues going with the light uh over the mini could be a good option rather than having to get additional minis to fill in any spot or coverage issues the light is going to be great for getting a little bit more distance if you're not 100 sure which direction to go the ap light is a good option to kind of stick with it's in a good mid-level price point and it has the newer wi-fi 6 technology so this is a great buy if you're not 100 sure and you just want to future proof yourself while also getting a smaller form factor than going with the big boy in the ax which we're going to talk about now okay on to the ax the full full-size ap1ax and this thing is a beast i've actually been running this in our rv for at least six months now and i can tell you this thing is insanely powerful even though it's mounted inside of our rv it it it blows away almost every wi-fi signal around it so be kind of careful with this if this is transmitting uh below our roof antenna we can't even see our roof antenna because this thing is putting out so much output it is a monster and it's heavy to boot it's about 2 pounds or 1.7 pounds but but it can be mounted on the ceiling and it is a very powerful device but it's pretty big so we're looking at nine inches by nine inches and a about i'd say an inch and a half or so thick um and it's gonna run at the highest power consumption at about 25 watts so it it generates some heat um but it again it is incredibly powerful the ax is it's kind of more of a business grade device in my opinion it's got some serious throughput though on the 2.4 gigahertz range you're talking about 1148 megabits so 1.148 gigabit um on the 5 gigahertz range it's 2.4 gigabit or 2400 megabit i mean that is a lot and that's probably why they claim this thing can support 250 devices that's a lot of throughput for one access point i kind of think you probably could support that many devices with that type of uh type of capacity on the flip side here you've got your ethernet input they've actually stepped this up to a 2.5 gigabit input which is a new standard kind of coming out beyond the standard one gigabit ethernet but most of the modems that peplink makes right now ourselves don't have 2.5 gigabit lan ports so this is something kind of that's going to future proof you uh but maybe not really give you the full throughput on day one then you've got your standard 12 volt power there as well flipping this guy over to get all of that throughput you've got four antennas on the 2.4 gigahertz range and four antennas on the five gigahertz range which is probably why the sucker is so heavy and those are five decibel gain antennas which is most likely why this thing's got such insane range and power well that and the fact that it's it's it's consuming about 25 watts so it's it's using up some power but it's uh it's giving you a lot of power and range in exchange for taking up that power a common complaint for folks that have purchased this in the past is that these led lights are extremely blue and extremely bright in dark situations in an rv they can make your rv look a bit like a disco and it's bright in their latest firmware they've actually added an option here to turn off the lights here making this a much more attractive option for mobile use both the ax and the ax light have slide ins here and come with t-rail mounts for folks that open the box and don't know what the what those plastic things are they're essentially made to help click these onto commercial drop ceilings um in various different sizes so that's what those little plastic parts are and they come with both the light and the ax but you've got your standard screw holes here if you want to wall mount this or mount it up to the ceiling and the t-rail click-ins that are removable also have screw holes on them as well so you can mount the small piece of plastic to a wall and then click this on for a nice clean installation option so that's an overview of the three primary access points that we see used quite a bit for mobile use we haven't covered the ap rugged in this video and we'll have a separate video for the ap rugged if that is one that is of interest to you but from a spec perspective the ap rugged is somewhat similar to the mini from a spec perspective other than it does support external antennas which wouldn't typically be necessary in a mobile application which is why we're focusing on the ap1 series in this video thank you so much for watching and if you have any questions please start up a chat at mobilemusthave.com or email us at info mobilemustap.com and we'll get right to you and we'll see on the road thanks for watching guys so [Music] you",

{"id": "eOd8qT8kBPk", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "mD1HSy0dp5lR-TMYfs0aM2rB_0E", "transcript": "hi this is eric with mobilemustave.com and livenlight.net and today we've got peplink's new balance 310 5g designation modem come along and we'll show you what it's all about [Music] now before we get into the features and the overview of this unit we want to sort of start by talking to you about use cases for the balance series modems and specifically the balance 310 5g these modems typically will not be something that you would want to put into a mobile kind of rv or mobile boat setup you could definitely do it but there are a few things that we'll talk about that might potentially be drawbacks if you were going to do that specifically probably the main one being that these this model does not have wi-fi and the balance series in general does not have wi-fi as when or the ability to pick up kind of campground or public wi-fi and use that as one of your internet sources now that said these do have the ability to use external access points and peplink has come out with quite a few very interesting wi-fi six and legacy wi-fi five devices that this can control to create a a pretty extensive wireless network where these devices really will shine however is in maybe if you're you have a branch office and you're looking to provide cellular backup connectivity to that branch office maybe if you have a cable modem or something else that is a little spotty and you want some failover this would be an excellent device also really good for rural home users folks that maybe they have a dsl line or no internet available in their area and they want to get some cellular connectivity at that location this also because it has a wan port for folks that maybe don't have a really good wired internet connection you could technically in the future when these things become available start to look at this wired wan port to uplink something like for instance starlink where you could utilize the cellular connectivity for your internet source and also the starlink and this because it has speed fusion capabilities has the ability to combine multiple internet connections into a single connection so it could be very interesting for rural home or branch office or even corporate headquarter use talking about the cellular side for a minute this is a dual modem device so you'll notice it's got four antenna ports here and then it has two antenna ports here these are all cellular ports the primary modem in this device is a 5g modem that will it's basically like a category 20 modem that also supports nationwide 5g the theoretical max download speed on that modem is four gigabits uh don't expect those types of speeds off the nation's networks right now but that is a theoretical max and a 700 megabit upload in the 5g spectrum for that primary modem if you step down into 4g that's a 2 gigabit modem we're still in the 5g modem but if you aren't connected to 5g it'll have a 2 gigabit maximum download and 150 megabit maximum upload speed on that 5g modem so it's that's a pretty fast solid uh primary modem they then take that modem and they pair it with a category 12 modem on this side category 12 modems are also pretty fast those are 600 megabit download max theoretical speed and 150 megabit upload speeds so you can use both of those modems at the same time in the balance 310 which makes it a pretty serious uh contender when it comes to dual cellular connectivity in terms of recommended users this or devices however you want to look at it peplink rates this at between 50 and 500 users so it's definitely up to the challenge for sort of your smaller or mid-size branch offices definitely up to the challenge if you're looking to use this in a rural home unscrewing our sim card slot port here just for a second bear with me we've got something a little interesting that peplink hasn't done too much before and that they have actually updated their sim form factor from their standard 2ff sort of large sim card and they've upgraded this to now accept nano sim cards it's just a different size sim they probably are doing this for a couple reasons most of the cellular carriers are stocking these nano sims because they go in phones and tablets so it's the most common size for sims and also folks have been putting the small sims into their modems and getting those little sims lost in them so my guess is pep link's probably upgrading to the nano size form factor to prevent warranty and other issues uh in the future but other than the fact that it's a smaller sim we're dealing with a a and b sim so two sim slots for our primary 5g modem and an a and b sim slot for our secondary category 12 modem for a total of four sim card slots two for the 5g two for the category 12. spinning the unit around to kind of the business end here we've got five gigabit uh lan ports for wired devices we've also got two sfp slots here these are also gigabit they're not 10 gigabit um but this can help out if you have fiber runs or you need to do extended runs above the kind of standard 300 feet that you want to use category 5 or category 6 with category 6 will go a little bit further but this will help you if you have any fiber uplinks for branch offices moving over to here we've got a usb port and this is very very um i'm very glad that they've put this on this modem this will allow us to use the the max adapter series of external modems for this device to add a third cellular modem to this so in theory we're talking about 5g modem here we could add a second 5g with the max g5g adapter here and then the category 12 cellular and on top of that the wan port that's a lot of connectivity for one modem and because this is a modem that is a prime care sku it comes with the speed fusion licensing to allow you to bond those connections together for a branch office or a rural home user hopefully you got some pretty high gigabyte data plans to pair with this bad boy but you could get a lot of throughput to keep those users active while your primary internet is down so this is pretty interesting stuff with the addition of that usb port wrapping up over here we've got um our 12-volt power plug here nice touch that they've added a locking ring on the power cord to plug that in it'll actually screw it shut or screw it down to prevent it from being accidentally removed for folks that have you know really dense racks and there's a lot of cables around and if you pull on something it gets unplugged you definitely don't want to unplug your primary firewall so that is a nice touch that they've they've added here you've also got a console cable port here for local administration console access most folks probably won't use that kind of the old dogs like me who still have console cables laying around will know what to do with that but not necessarily for everybody so that's kind of the overview of this let's take a look at what's included in the box so peplink's making my job pretty easy here not a lot included we've got six of these uh cellular antennas it looks like they've included the 600 megahertz all the way up to 2.7 gigahertz antennas on all six of these that will give you four for your 5g modem and two uh for your category 12 modem they've included rubber feet here so that you can go ahead and mount that where it's not sliding all over the place as well as the 12 volt power adapter with the included uh power extension cable the uh the power wire here is a standard uh i'm not 100 sure the nema rating on this but this is the same thing that goes in the back of every single computer probably anyone's ever owned very standard and then your power supply uh as well one thing to note this is a 60 watt power supply at 12 volts that's 5 amps at 12 volts that's a lot of wattage uh more than we typically see in in some of the mobility routers so i would be a little bit concerned about folks possibly wanting to cut this and go ahead and just wire it into 12 volts make sure if you were interested in making this a 12 volt mobile ready router that you uh you were 100 sure you had enough uh gauge cable to make sure that you could pass 60 watts through that to keep this modem happy now while this unit does not have wi-fi built into it um i can kind of understand why peplink did that because most folks that are going to be engaging in purchasing something like this for a branch office or a rural home probably have an existing wi-fi solution that being said if you don't the balanced series modems do have the integrated peplink wi-fi controller built into them which means you can buy pretty much any peplink wireless access point that they sell on the market plug it into this and it will automatically provision that access point and you can plug in multiple access points and they will provision all of them with the same ssid and settings based on how you configure that so you can manage a lot of access points 20 plus access points with one of these and that's just really great if you you want to get a corporate wi-fi or or a large home covered with a lot of wi-fi the access points also support wireless mesh or wireless uplink so you don't necessarily have to run ethernet cables to each of those if you've got some dead spots in that location we have separate videos on wireless mesh and also how to configure the ap controller and how to add access points talking throughput for a minute your max router throughput is one gigabit on the kind of the back plane of this so it will support those faster cable modems and other devices that are going to go up to one gigabit um which is pretty fast for a device like this and more than enough for the real world application of what you're going to see out of those cellular modems in terms of if you start to look at pep vpn or site-to-site connectivity uh this device has a support for up to 600 megabits for an unencrypted tunnel and 500 megabits for an encrypted tunnel with 256-bit encryption that's pretty fast for an encrypted tunnel um if you're just using it for speed fusion uh which is like this the bonding of multiple way connections i don't recommend you encrypt your internet traffic since it's going out to the internet anyway but if you're doing site-to-site connectivity with sensitive information you can enable that uh encryption feature that is built into the the speedfusion products so that's the overview here of the uh balance 310 5g from peplink if you have any questions or want to speak to somebody about this device you can hop over to mobilemustap.com and start up a chat and we will get to you as soon as possible thanks so much for watching guys and we'll

how to add external secondary access points to your pep wave max br1 mini or max br1 mk2 [Music] thanks so much for joining us guys so as said on the intro we're going to be talking about adding secondary access points for additional wireless coverage to your peplink max series modem now this this video specifically will be for max br1 mini and max br1 mk2s that are in our popular entry level bundles so if you have an essentials bundle or you have a full timer bundle this video is for you if you bought the modems without the roof antenna you can still do everything we're going to talk about today for adding these access points if you have a different modem and you're not sure which video you want to look at you can go ahead and ask us and we'll point you in the right direction but in general if you look at the spec sheet what you're looking for is does it have a wireless controller and the controllers allow it to control these access points these modems do not have controllers so today's video is about showing you how to set up these devices manually to work with the pep links that we're discussing if you have a speed demon bundle or an ultimate road warrior bundle or any of the transit series modems that we sell go ahead and skip over to the video in the description below specific for how to set up access points for those modems all right enough with that let's get started now adding an access point like this is typically sort of a phase 2 type scenario for this video we're going to assume you've set up the basics on this modem so make sure you follow the setup and get start guides that we emailed to you when you purchased the modem uh to to kind of take care of the basics there's also a second video that we have for setting up wi-fi best practices and we'll link that to the description below as well now that will sort of baseline the wireless in your device to perform optimally in an rv environment kind of reduces the amount of problems that you'll have by setting it up that way and also maximizes the compatibility for devices like printers and smart tvs and other stuff so get your baseline set up go ahead and set up your wi-fi and then if you're adding access points this video is for you so let's talk about the components of what we have here uh we've got uh these little wires here are power wires so we've got a power wire running to our pep wave uh max or i'm sorry this is an ap mini access point we've got a power run wire here running to our router we have all of our cellular and wi-fi antennas connected that's very important the only antenna we're missing here is the gps antenna that's the only antenna that's optional when you're working on anything with your pep wave a lot of customers think oh i'll just connect one of these it'll work no it won't it'll create a ton of interference and you'll have nothing but problems so connect all those up nice and snug don't use a wrench just hand tighten the next component we have here is an ethernet cable and what we're doing is we're uplinking from the lan as l is in lan like like lima over to plug into the access point now what we've got is a solid green status light on our pep wave here and we've got a solid green status light on our access point as well so we're essentially kind of all plugged in and ready for baseline now before we start i recommend that you do a factory reset on your access points if you kind of messed around with them before you got to this video or i don't know anything just happened it's just for good measure to prevent you having problems in the future so what we're going to do again we've got green lights on those status lights solid green we're going to go ahead and take a paper clip and we're going to insert it there into that reset hole until we hear a click and we're going to hold it down we'll get a solid red status light and then we're going to wait about 15 to 20 seconds it'll blink red for a while and then it will go off once that light goes off we know that this has been factory reset now we're just going to wait for about one to two minutes to let it boot back up once we get back to the solid green status light we're ready to start configuring while we're waiting for that access point to reboot you may be wondering do i have to run an ethernet cable from the peplink to the access point the answer is no but you probably should if you can now having a wired up link like this will ensure that the access point can perform optimally and as quick as possible wired links are always going to be faster but the peplink does support something called wireless uplink or wireless mesh which means that you can do away with this ethernet cable and this will act like a repeater essentially picking up the wi-fi signal from this and re-broadcasting it in another part of your rv that's the next video in our series you have to follow all the steps in this video with the wired cable before you can move on to setting up mesh but you can do it all right so we're back to a solid green light here we're plugged in we've got our pep link online now we're going to hop over to the computer and connect to the wi-fi on the pep link you should already have that all set up again because of the quick start guide so just connect over to your peplink wi-fi and then you can follow us on the screen share and we'll show you how to set all this up all right guys welcome to my desktop so first thing we want to do is connect to our wi-fi on the pep wave and if you've got a lot of wi-fi networks in the area like i do this can be challenging when you're doing configuration because computers especially like macs like mine will hop off of the wi-fi or connector to and just try to jump onto another wi-fi in the middle of the configuration process if the pep wave is rebooting this is because those computers see the wi-fi as being down and go oh i got to get back online and then they swap over so if you're having trouble connecting to the management console throughout this process it's typically because you've made changes to the router or to a device that needs to reboot or so you just need to wait if it needs to reboot or because you've hopped off the wi-fi so always check periodically that you're on the right wi-fi while throughout this process so smith family wi-fi or smith family 2 gigahertz is the name of the wi-fi for our test modem we're going to hop into the management console of that modem at 192.168.50.1 which is the default this may ask you for a username and password mine won't because i've already logged into this device if you have any questions about accessing the management console make sure to check out our peplink quick start guide which you can find at guides.mobilemustave.com or we emailed it to you when you purchased the device as well okay so we've got ourselves here inside of the device now again i'm going to hop over to the access point tab to show you we've configured this device using our wireless best practices settings that are in our wireless best practice video which you'd want to complete before you get started with this that separate separates out the 2 gigahertz and the 5 gigahertz networks for optimal performance and compatibility all right so as mentioned before in the video we've got our access point uh ap mini connected to the lan port of our device so we're gonna hop over to status and just show you that that is confirmed under client list when we go to client list we'll see this little green arrow that sort of indicates that you have an active connection then it's connected via a wired connection if you had a little wireless icon it would be wireless like my computer is those are the two devices that this has online note this ip address here that is where the access point is located and we're going to check that out in a minute but before we do that we want to hop over and copy some settings so for me i'm going to go ahead and open up notes i'm going to create a new note and we're going to let's document up some information so since we're going to have to manually configure that access point we're going to click on the ap tab go to the 2 gigahertz wi-fi that we have here and we're going to want to copy our ssid exactly so i'm just going to write in two gig well wi-fi settings for my i'm going to write ssid and then i'm going to say password i'm going to paste that as well you can go ahead and uncheck hide characters these are all just test passwords but everything that we have here is going to have to match when we set up the next access point so i'm going to copy them all down now all right so that is all set i already know that i've got wpa2 personal and all those settings because that was what we set up in our wi-fi best practice video now i'm going to hop over into the five gigahertz do the same thing we're going to paste that down here and i'm going to grab that password as well again wpa personal no other settings are needed great now that we've got those two we've got what we need from the access point now i'm going to hop over to the status tab again go to clients and i'm going to copy this ip address for that access point and i'm going to open up a new tab i'm going to paste that in so now instead of 50.1 we're at 50.10. now the password for the device when you first log into it is typically public username admin password public it is actually stamped on the sticker on the bottom of your access point and again if you can't get in for some reason make sure to follow that paper clip reset procedure that we showed you at the very beginning of this video okay we're in the access points administration console as you can see it looks very similar to your pep links administration console but they are different devices so make sure you keep an eye on these tabs and you know which tab you're in you'll always know by the address here which one is the access point and which one's the router the router will always be dot one all right so now we're going to copy those wi-fi settings to this device but before we do do so i do recommend that you hop into the system tab click on the firmware button and check for the latest firmware this device already has the latest firmware as of june 2021 so we're all set here but you can check for firmware and then update it directly there you just need to make sure that your pep link is online so let's go ahead and go to the access point tab and we're going to create new ssids in this case i'm going to hop over to my notepad and i'm going to copy exactly what i had in the other one now these are potentially case sensitive so you want to make sure you get everything exact spaces dashes capitals everything identical to ensure that your devices don't see these as different wi-fi networks you also need to make sure that your security matches as well so we're selecting everything based on what we saw in the last modem and everything in accordance with our wi-fi best practices do not copy my wi-fi password this is just an example password pick your own but you have an idea we have a capital here numbers and a symbol as an example we don't recommend you use an exclamation point as a symbol everyone guesses that so now we've got our two gigahertz set up that's pretty much everything we need there and we're going to go ahead and hit save and we're going to add our next ssid here which is our 5 gigahertz we're going to go ahead and hit wpa personal we're going to paste in that same password we have make sure that you match up your passwords and we're going to hit save again and then we're going to go ahead and delete the default pepwave wi-fi here all right we're not going to apply changes quite yet we're going to hop over into the settings tab and we because we've got the smith family 2 gigahertz and the 5 gigahertz we want them to run on the correct network so two gigahertz we check two five gigahertz we check five this again all based on the wi-fi best practices if you didn't follow our best practices then you need to make sure that these settings match up with whatever is on your router on the same tab okay great we've got that saved and we're going to go ahead and hit apply changes and wait for the device to reboot okay now that's pretty much it for setting up the devices at this point you can relocate your secondary access point let's say 15 20 25 feet away from your primary for optimal use again you're going to need that ethernet cable to connect them or you can hop over to our wireless mesh wireless uplink video next to remove that cable now i'm just going to bring up a wireless analyzer here to kind of show you what's going on this might bounce around a little bit because i've got these two access points very close together so they're probably fighting quite a bit being about a foot apart but as you can see here we've got smith family wi-fi 2 gigahertz and smith family wi-fi 2 gigahertz this is operating on channel 11 and this is operating on channel 6. however they're so close together that it's not 100 sure what's going on they keep bouncing up and down so that gives you an idea of why you need to make sure you've got your access points far apart up here if you look i am connected to the two gigahertz we do not have two networks listed so they are running on the same ssid and they are broadcasting from both devices they're just a bit too close together now if you want you can or if you're experiencing challenges or issues you can hard set your channels to avoid them hopping around if they're set to auto typically auto works well just because people move into different campgrounds and certain channels will be very saturated so when you move it may affect what works better or not but there's nothing wrong with hard setting the channels if you want you just may have to go in and pop and check pop in and check to make sure they're running on on a channel that's not super saturated in your area under the ap tab under settings you can click the channel button for 2 gigahertz on this left column we recommend 1 6 or 11. those are the those are the channels that are furthest apart so they don't overlap and then you can do the same in 5 gigahertz that's the wrong one 36 149 165 are good channels that also don't overlap for an example if you hard set a channel in your access point let's say to channel one then you're going to want to go into your pap link under access point and you're going to want to hard set your channel there as well under say channel 6. you don't want to hard set them on the same channel because they will most likely interfere with themselves since they're going to be in fairly close proximity in your rv the next thing i want to discuss from a troubleshooting perspective is that if you are having connectivity dropouts or any issues you can go ahead and check check your channel with and drop this down to 20 megahertz this will reduce the amount of bandwidth that you have on your wireless but it will also decrease the number of challenges or problems because it's simplifying how the wi-fi network works so you can go ahead and do that during troubleshooting see if that resolves any issues and then you can you know try 40 megahertz or auto and see if that recreates the issue typically for rv use moving it down to 20 megahertz is still more than enough bandwidth for all the devices you have to run and operate you know without issue but that is an interesting troubleshooting step that you can enable if you're having some dropout issues or connectivity issues with a particular device that may be common or that may be useful if you've got an older printer or a smart tv or something that's just not connecting to the wi-fi dropping that channel with can often resolve that issue all right so you've configured the basics on your wireless access point and it's good to go at this point so we're going to want these to be at least probably at least 20 feet apart or so to ensure that the wireless coverage from each of them kind of optimally balances your clients as they connect as a reminder if you're following just this video you're going to need to continue to have this ethernet cable connected so you're going to have to run that to the location for this access point and you're going to have to have the unit powered now if you're interested in continuing to run just ethernet you can look at our 8 port poe switch or our 1 port 12 volt poe injector that'll take the 12 volts from your house battery and it will provide the power wire this over the ethernet cable so that's an option for folks that just want to want run the one ethernet cable we do have some options since these modems do not supply power over the ethernet now that you've followed the basic setup instructions for configuring an external access point you can look to enable mesh or wireless uplink to remove this ethernet cable you're still going to need power these have to be powered somehow but there are options for powering the device not just with using this ac adapter that we do talk about in the mesh video so now that you've completed this step you can move on to mesh wireless uplink using the link below and that's it guys thank you so much for watching again i know i've said it a bunch before but this is part of a multi-part video series so make sure you follow in the steps as necessary if you're just about you know done with this the next video in the in the series would be setting up the wireless uplink if applicable you don't need to do that if you're planning on keeping this ethernet cable thank you so much and we'll see on the

{"id": "Fzj_q2l-qF0", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "iTEwcPzJPBG24qSvTC9w47WFpSs", "transcript": "hi my name is eric from mobilemusthave.com and livenlight.net and today we're going to talk about peplink's wireless mesh or what i like to call wireless uplink feature for external access points [Music] thanks so much for joining us guys and we're super excited to talk to you about wireless uplink also known in the pep link world as wireless mesh now before you get started on anything we talk about this in this video you're going to want to make sure you've followed two previous videos that we've put together the first one is our wi-fi best practices video which will enable basically tells you how to set up the wi-fi on this device in kind of the best case scenario so that's the most compatible with various devices and gives you the most flexibility for longer range or higher speed depending on what devices you're connecting to it so that video is linked below that's step one step two is our external or additional access point video and that video uh there's two videos that are out there the one that's most popular is for our transit line so that would be our speed demon road warrior ultimate road warrior bundles any bundle that has a modem that's um that's a transit line or really any modem that hasn't built in access point controller to control these external access points you want to follow that video in its entirety which will set up these access points to run via this wire that's step two if you have a essentials bundle with a br1 mini or a full timer bundle with the br1mk2 there's another video for that to again set up the external devices with the ethernet cable the reason why there's two separate videos is because these have the access point controllers and the mk2 and the mini do not so it's different different setup and we didn't want to make one giant video we've broken them up based on what um what bundles you have so you follow those two videos one is your your uh okay here's your baseline setup best practices video then it's how to add these devices and then if you want to get rid of this ethernet cable and do a wireless uplink that's this video all of them are linked below and now that we're on to the third video which is the wireless uplink video let's get started so in front of us here we've got a access point by pep link this is called the ap one mini if you have an ap1ax or an ap rugged or any of the other ones the procedures are essentially identical it's just a different form factor when we talk about wireless mesh and a lot of our customers want to know how to do this we're talking about how to get this access point somewhere else in the rv to pick up the signal that the transit is broadcasting um in this case it's a transit but you may be with another device um pretty much any of the pep waves we have will will support this function um so for this example we're using a transit but it can be any device and you want to remove this ethernet cable the idea is can i put this somewhere in the rv and wirelessly uplink it to the cellular internet coming off my pep link without having to run an ethernet cable that's what we're going to cover in today's video now the answer to can you do it is yes the answer is should you do it is not unless you have to if there's any way you can run this ethernet cable between the transit and the mini it will be faster wired up links are always preferred over wireless uplinks but we know for instance if you're in a slide or somewhere else where it's just impossible to get cables to we get it and that's what this video is for okay perfect so we're going to assume you've got this device set up via the ethernet cable it's online it's working and now we want to figure out how to get that mesh working perfect so we're going to leave these all powered on with their green status lights meaning they're all online and we're good to go now we're going to hop into the computer and i'm going to show you how to turn on and configure the wireless uplink or mesh all right let's get started with setting up mesh now the first step we want to do is get into our admin console which is typically at 192.168.50.1 now you have to be connected to the pep wave wi-fi to access your local admin console now mine's located at a slightly different address because i do a lot of tech support but yours should be at 50.1 the username and password to get in will be whatever you've set if you have not set one before the default password is admin but it will require you to change it at your first login if you're not sure how to get into this check out our quick start or get started guide at support.mobilemust-have.com which will give you the basics all right so let's get going with mesh i'm going to hop over to the access point tab here and we're going to click on the wireless mesh sub tab we're going to create some wireless mesh profiles here that the devices will use i'm just going to call this mesh 2 gigahertz and i'm going to run this at 2 gigahertz 2.4 gigahertz and i'm going to create a password this should be a password that let's do that now that's not a great password but just for example purposes i've got a capital some numbers and a symbol this password is what the access points will use to talk to each other to ensure your wireless network remains secure now the wireless uplink can only use one frequency at a time either the 5 gigahertz or the 2.4 gigahertz but what i'm going to do is create two profiles so that in the future if i want to switch up links to five gigahertz or two point five pic gigahertz i can so let's do five gigahertz and i'm going to use the same key here for example purposes only so now i've got two profiles mesh two gigahertz and mesh five gigahertz that are set up and ready to go i'm not going to apply changes yet just because i only want to reboot once i'm going to click on the settings tab here i've got my default wireless profile here set up now as mentioned earlier please set up your access point using our wireless best practices video before you enable mesh and before you add secondary access points that video is linked below and you can also find it at support.mobilemustaf.com and just search for wi-fi best practices or wi-fi setup and you'll find that article and it kind of gives you the the baselines of how things should be set up but we're going to assume you've done that already so we're going to go here to mesh and i'm going to select mesh five gigahertz now typically you want your up wireless uplinks to run on five gigahertz as pos if possible because the five gigahertz network is faster um if you experience any connectivity issues or dropouts with the secondary access points or clients connected to the secondary access point you can go ahead and swap that over to the 2.4 gigahertz and test that and that usually will resolve any issues but we're going to go with five gigahertz because typically an rv is short enough where five gigahertz even though it has smaller shorter range will uh still work for wireless uplink now that we've saved those two we're going to go ahead and hit apply changes and confirm all right so you've got the mesh settings configured excellent the next thing you want to do is be patient and wait i want you to give these devices about 10 minutes to make sure that the mesh configurations are downloaded to the access point from everything you just set up in your in your mobile router but the worst thing you want to do is start unplugging stuff while it's in the middle of the config so let's just be patient give it some time and that will ensure that this device has received the settings you just set up a minute ago we've waited our 10 minutes thank you for being patient now we're ready to unplug the ethernet cable and relocate the device all right guys so i'm hopping over to the other side of the room here and we're going to plug in our access point we've got a solid red light that assuming we've set up everything correctly is going to go green and then the wi-fi light typically on the ap mini and most of these will begin to blink green and that's when we know we're good to go all right so we looks like we've got solid status green i'll give you a close-up on that and then blinking wi-fi now during the boot procedure the wi-fi may go solid green that usually means it's initializing and then if any clients connect to this it will start flashing rapidly meaning that data is transferring back and forth typically but don't worry too much if you've got a solid status light that's green and a wi-fi light that's doing whatever it's doing because of traffic you should be good to go we're gonna take uh this put this down leave that where it is plugged in and then we're gonna go back into the management console and show you how to confirm that everything's working all right so back to our dashboard here now um i recommend that if you have just recently relocated your access point like we have to wait uh a minimum of five minutes to allow the wireless uplink and wireless mesh to associate and bring that access point online so let's check we've waited about 10 minutes just to be safe we're going to hop over to our access point tab and boom there we go there's the one that we just unplugged and it is showing as available as a managed access point right now so let's just go ahead and check under mesh wds here and we should get a graphic interpretation of what i'm showing you right now along with our signal strength and we do so what we see here is the transit primary router i've got this access point down below me hardwired in with ethernet again try to hardwire whenever possible but we understand it's not always possible with different rigs and then we've got our ap rear which is represented by this dotted line over here that is connected via wireless so wireless uplink mesh is enabled that's it you've configured wireless uplink or wireless mesh on a peplink device congratulations uh if you have any questions or concerns you can visit our website at support.mobilemustap.com and check out various help articles or reach out to us if you need some assistance thank you so much and we will see you on the road [Music] you", "snippet": {"publishedAt":

external access points to your pepwave mobile [Music] router all right thanks for joining us sorry if it's a little bit noisy in here we're in the middle of a big heat wave and i have to keep the air conditioners going so that i don't die so there's going to be three videos in this series uh and we'll link below to the various videos depending on the setup that you have the first video that we're going to cover which is today's video is going to be a video that covers adding access points to pep wave max transit series devices or other pep wave devices that have the built-in wireless access point controller software built into the firmware for the most part for our mobile customers that would be the transit series that includes our ultimate road warrior road warrior and speed demon bundles if you have a full timer or essentials bundle your modem does not have a built-in access point controller for external access point management however you can still plug these in they just have to be configured manually we are doing a separate video on that which we'll link to in the description below the third video in this series is going to be covering something that peplink calls wireless mesh i'm not 100 sure the term mesh is the right term uh what i like to call it is wireless uplink and what it essentially means is that you can add one of these access points without the ethernet cable uplinked from this device we're going to start with this video showing you how to configure and set up these devices using the ethernet cable which is the required step anyway if you're setting up mesh and if you want to do wires wireless uplink meaning you don't need this ethernet cable for this secondary access point to function go to the video in the description below that talks about wireless uplink or wireless mesh all right so let's get started with the setup we've got a max transit category 18 here if you have a duo or a cat 6 or 12 duo all exactly the same setup so don't worry about that now for the example purposes here we're using the small paddle antennas for wi-fi back here and cellular on this device if you have a roof antenna where you've replaced these with a roof antenna from our bundle kit that's perfectly fine as well nothing really changes with how you're going to set this up now most of our customers to be perfectly honest don't necessarily need to add secondary access points the power that's coming from the transit to transmit off the roof antenna or from the local paddle antennas is typically more than enough to cover the length of the rv but if you're in a situation where you've got a lot of wi-fi interference or your coach is made of materials that are causing some challenges for you adding secondary access points can give you additional coverage in spots where your wi-fi signal might not be as strong as you'd like it to be one before we start with configuring your external access point we recommend that you check out our wi-fi best practices video where we set up the wi-fi on your core router your mobile router here first before we worry about secondary access points that'll probably save you a lot of time and energy so make sure you check out that video we go through baseline settings and how to configure it for optimal performance and optimal compatibility with all of your devices in your rv that is linked below so looking on the table here we've got a couple parts we've got our modem as you can see here we have our power to that modem you may power the modem via the 12 volt or with the included ac adapter doesn't matter but the modem will have to be obviously powered we recommend getting your modem set up and functionally working with your sim cards and everything else before you move on to adding access points you want to have as few variables as possible when you're setting something up so get this up and running and working and then move on to this so we'll assume you've got your modem online and working and you're just looking to add an access point in addition to that power we've got an ethernet cable here obviously this one's a very short cable in your installation environment if you're looking to use a wired up link let's not have the wireless from this and the wireless from this this close together these would create a lot of interference with each other but for demonstration purposes we want to show you kind of how the connectors connect if you're running up to a roof antenna you may be able to use a smaller cable since that antenna will be up higher but we do typically recommend that you try to get these access points 15 to 20 feet apart if you can so that they don't interfere with each other and you can take advantage of your roof antenna as well as the access point inside the rv in order for your access point to function it's going to need a couple things one it's going to need to be able to receive the internet or data connection and in this case that's via this ethernet cable and it's also going to need power now the device itself does support something called power over ethernet which means you can supply power via this ethernet cable however the transits do not supply power over ethernet it's not a feature in those devices if you're looking to run one single wire and you want to add access points via power over ethernet you can add our 8 port poe switch that is on our store we'll also link that down below and that will give you power over ethernet that switch is very unique in that you can connect 12 volt power from your house batteries and it will up convert that to 48 volts which is what is needed for power over ethernet really cool and unique feature but not necessarily needed since this does come with the ability to just plug it into ac power if you have an inverter and you want to run that on your inverter or on our store you can also pick up these dc barrel connectors and what that will do we'll just unplug this plug that in and that will give you two screw down terminals where you can connect directly in 12 volt power from your house batteries to power this device you can pair this with our dc fused 3 amp dc power wire that we sell on the store as well and between the barrel connector and the dc power wire you can power up these access points and put them anywhere in the coach typically people can grab power from a variety of sources in your rv including your lights and other power sources that are located just about everywhere just make sure that if you do grab it from a light or something else you're grabbing it from the powered side not the switch side you don't want your access point to turn off when you turn off your light switch so as mentioned before you can technically remove this ethernet cable once everything is configured not before and this device will wirelessly transmit to this device and then this will rebroadcast your wi-fi they have to be within range of each other um and this device has to have that 12 volt power it's not magical it can't power itself with over the internet with or over the air without any power but if you do give it power and you set up wireless uplink which is our next video you do not need this ethernet cable but we do recommend that if your installation allows the ethernet cable if you can get this wire to a location inside the rv to leave this uplink wired it will mean that the speeds on this wireless access point will be faster because the wired cable is a gigabit cable and if you're doing wireless uplink that's going to be significantly slower it's still going to work fine with wireless uplink mode you'll still be able to watch netflix and do normal internet browsing but if you can get that ethernet cable in it will be more reliable so if you can run the wire go for it otherwise move on to the mesh but either way as i said before you've got to set this all up using an ethernet cable so we're going to get started with that now now if you stumbled across this video after trying to set up your access point yourself that's okay but we do want you to follow one step before you get started with our instructions which are going to save you a lot of time later now what you're going to want to do is reset this device to factory defaults so that it can be adopted by the access point controller it's it's just for good measure even if you haven't opened this and tried it we do recommend that you reset the device just to ensure it's 100 factory reset so that it will be adopted by the controller now in order to do that all you need to do is unplug the ethernet just have the device like this go ahead and power the device up you'll see a red light there that light will turn green once the device that that light turns green the device has booted up take a paper clip just like this you'll see a small reset button there that is indicated by an arrow in the shape of a circle with a point on it and you're going to want to hold down the reset button there nice and firm for about 15 to 20 seconds until this red light turns off and i'll show you that in just a second once this completely boots up all right we've got our green light we're ready to go we're gonna factory reset this unit so we're going to hold down that button we've got a red light there we're just going to keep holding that keep going boom you see how that light started to blink we're just going to wait a little bit longer and now the red light is off perfect we're going to let go of that reset button leave that device alone for about one to two minutes let it reset fully until that light again is solid green for status while we wait for this to boot back up your light configuration may be slightly different if it's a different model than the ap mini but that's okay the reset procedure is the same make sure you have a solid green light hold down that reset button count up to 20 seconds just to be safe nice and slow and then you can release that and let the device reboot back to green and you will be at factory defaults all right our access point is booted back up we've got a solid green light now we're going to take our ethernet cable and we're going to plug this device in to our ethernet port on the access point and to our lan with an l not when with a w we want lan with an l that's our local network and that's where access points live if you put them in that wrong port into the wamport um it's not going to work that's the that's on the outside of the firewall so nothing's going to happen so you want to be on lan your transit should be powered on and ready to go you're going to plug that ethernet cable in and also of course make sure you've got power to the access point that's the end of the initial physical setup now we're going to hop into a screen share and show you how to enable the wireless controller all right welcome to my public management console so typically you'd go to 192.168.50.1 which is the default ip of your pep wave in order to get to the admin console you're going to need to be connected to your pep wave wi-fi and again we recommend you follow our wi-fi setup best practices before you move on to adding access points my pep wave is at a slightly different address because i do a lot of technical support and i have to connect a router so i need to not use the default address but for you it will be 50.1 unless you've changed it so let's go ahead and log in uh the password uh default will be admin but that was likely changed if you've ever been into the admin console before if you're not sure how to get into this admin console check out our get started guide which we've got to give you the basics i've just moved over to the access point tab and this modem has already been set up so i just unchecked that but what you're going to see is going to look very much like this if you've not set up access points for external aps we're going to take this access point controller we're going to enable enable external ap we're going to leave the sync method to as soon as possible and we're going to say any permitted ap is allowed because if it's plugged into your pep wave via an ethernet cable we're going to assume it's probably allowed and then we're going to go ahead and hit click save and then you're going to want to click apply changes and confirm up in this corner to enable the access point controller all right you've enabled the wireless controller congratulations now you've got a tough job ahead of you no i'm just kidding all you need to do is wait and the number one thing people don't do is wait long enough and they think something's not working it it will come online and it will work but this will look for access points uh every so often typically i tell customers wait 10 to 15 minutes for the access point to be recognized by the transit and for the transit to do something called adopt the access point when it adopts the access point the access point has to reboot a few times it resets the password and adds some security functionality so that it can control this access point and protect your network it also takes all the wireless configuration from the transit like the name of your network and whatnot and moves it and copies it to the secondary access point so that can take a little bit of time the worst thing you want to do is get impatient and unplug stuff thinking it's not working while it's in the middle of updating because then you're going to have to start completely over from scratch using that paper clip to kind of go back to the beginning of this video so just take your time go for a walk do whatever you got to do 10 to 15 minutes is usually all the time you need once you've waited 10 or 15 minutes let's hop back in to our screen share and i'll show you that your access point is now online all right we're back inside of the management console so let's go ahead on the ap tab here go over to access point hey look at that we've got some managed access points that are showing up and in the case of what we've just configured this is the access point if you're not sure you can actually check the serial number on the bottom of the device and it will match this default name i've actually got two access points in this particular setup so you see this one that says mini basement if you go ahead and click this edit button here it will bring up the ap details tab i'm going to actually give this a friendly name call it ap rear leave that as bedroom for the location and we're going to leave all the other settings default and hit save here on the name and then close and that has now updated the name here to ap rear now down at the very bottom here you see the name of my transit which is also an access point because it is transmitting as well so at this point you are configured and good to go to check the status of who is connected to which access point you can there's quite a bit of information that you can find here if we click on the info tab here you'll see your three access points they're all showing data and you can actually un if you check any of these it will gray out and it'll show you the remaining information so if i for instance uncheck them all i just want to see the ap rear it'll say okay there's well there's no clients connected to it because we just booted it up and i can check this access point okay i've got three clients on that and i've got three clients on that so that'll give you an idea of who's connected and you can also search by frequency here you can also check out this wireless ssid tab here which will give you each of your networks and you can expand these out and see total received and send data across each frequency number of access points and clients that are transmitting on each of these frequencies if you move down you can this is a nice feature be able to see the wireless clients by ssid and by the access point they're connected to now i wouldn't be too concerned if you do find that a device is connected to an access point potentially that is further away than another one if you do find that happens usually if you just reset or reboot that device it will connect to the closest one but oftentimes it may connect to a further one if it's on a channel that it feels it's getting a better signal from so i wouldn't worry too much about that these devices tend to do a pretty decent job of load balancing across all the access points to maximize how everything works congratulations your access point's now online it's working perfect now as we said before if you're interested in setting up the wireless uplink so that you can get rid of this ethernet cable again you're still going to need the power got to power it somehow then go on to our wireless uplink mesh video which is linked below thanks so much for watching and we'll see on the road [Music] you", "snippet": {"publishedAt":

{"id": "fuHCDC0ccwI", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "2clM_vI6L5TTNTQNsPhyZ_7qO48", "transcript": "hi this is eric with mobilemustav.com and \nlivenlight.net and today we're going to talk   through how to optimally configure the wireless \nnetworks on a pepwave router now before we get   into hopping over to the computer and showing \nyou the screenshots and all the settings   i want to talk to you a little bit about wi-fi um \nspecifically kind of what the flavors are and what   specific frequencies are good for what use cases \nso most pep wave devices whether you're looking   at our full timer bundle all the way up to \nour ultimate road warrior bundle will have a   wireless chipset that can communicate in multiple \nfrequencies specifically 2.4 gigahertz wi-fi or 5   gigahertz wi-fi it's really 5.8 gigahertz uh wi-fi \nbut everyone calls it 5 gigahertz wi-fi or 5g   don't confuse that with cellular 5g that's a \ncompletely different thing that means fifth   generation the terminology can get confusing for \ntoday's video we're talking only about wi-fi and   when we use the term wi-fi we're talking about the \nnetwork local to your rv or boat or whatever your   mobile setup is so that's usually like a one \nto two hundred or so foot range around your rv   with optimal kind of service around 50 feet or \nless of wireless connectivity going from the pep   wave device to your other devices like your phone \nor your laptops etc smart tvs all of that stuff   so by default out of the box the wireless in the \npep wave is configured to basically run on what's   called auto which means that the pep wave will \ndecide based on the devices and how many devices   you have on the network which devices to put on \nthe 2.4 gigahertz network and which to put on the   5 gigahertz network and when they switch between \nthe networks you may experience issues that   it's not the worst way to set things up but we \ntend to recommend that you split out the networks   into two separate networks for optimal performance \nwhile on the road the reason why we recommend you   split the 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz wireless \nnetworks is because it can increase compatibility   with older devices smart tvs and printers \nand also because 2.4 gigahertz networks tend   to be better at certain things and 5 gigahertz \nnetworks tend to be better at different things   specifically the 2.4 gigahertz network tends to \nhave longer range um that's very good for phones   or for devices that you you move around a lot \nin the rv with because you want both to be able   to work outside on the patio through the walls and \nwhatnot the five gigahertz has a benefit though in   that it's faster it can carry more bandwidth over \nits wireless connection that tends to be really   good for things like desktop computers possibly a \nsmart tv that's not going to move around a lot and   by balancing what devices are connected \nto the 2 gigahertz versus the 5 gigahertz   you can optimize your network to support more \ndevices overall if that's over your head and   you're like oh what am i doing don't worry we're \ngoing to walk through the specific settings that   we recommend for all users for setting up their \nwireless so let's hop on over to the computer   and we'll run through everything to get your pep \nwave from getting out of the box to being set up   and ready to rock all right so let's get started \ni've got my screen share here and uh before we   start we want to make sure that we have all of \nthe antennas connected a lot of folks think oh   i've got two cellular antennas or maybe four in \nthe case of one of our transit series i just can   hook up one while i'm doing testing i don't need \nall these antennas that is absolutely not true all   antennas must be hooked up the only exception is \nthis gps antenna and the location will be slightly   different depending on the model of your unit but \nthat one can be left off everything else needs to   remain connected otherwise you will experience a \nlot of interference and problems with your wi-fi   setup now that you've gotten yourself into the \npepwave dashboard it's time to configure this   optimally so let's go ahead and do that now this \nis a default modem so this is basically right   out of the box fresh if you've made any changes \nto your device you can reset it back to factory   by following our factory reset instructions which \nare available at support.mobilemusthave.com just   go ahead and search reset you'll find the reset \narticle or you can simply modify any settings you   changed back to what we're going to show you here \ntoday whatever's easier for you so to start we're   going to go to the ap tab all things re related to \naccess points or wireless are going to be on that   ap tab and we're going to create a new wireless \nnetwork here we're not going to mess with this one   that's already existing because we're connected \nto that network we will delete it later but we   want to create a new one now so that we don't get \ndisconnected from the modem i'm going to assume   we're setting this up for the smith family and \nwe're going to call the first wireless network we   create the smith family 2 gigahertz network and as \nwe said before 2 gigahertz will have longer range   and more compatibility but it will be a little bit \nslower but it's usually the most reliable kind of   what i do everything with network however the five \ngigahertz again will be faster and can work better   in certain really really dense campgrounds where \nthere's tons of wi-fi on the two gigahertz range   so we got our name of our wireless this \nssid up here that's going to give us   kind of what pops up over here when we look for \nwi-fi and we're going to leave all of these other   settings the same except for security we want \nto absolutely make sure we set a password to   our wi-fi we're going to select wpa2 personal the \nreason why we're selecting that is because wpa3   can have some compatibility issues with older \ntechnology and older phones and printers   and if you select wpa wpa2 down here most \niphones will give you a security warning   saying that your wi-fi is insecure so wpa2 \nis a really good blend right in the middle   we're then going to create a shared key this \nis your password to your wi-fi so what do we   want our password to be i'm going to create \nuh a simple one here with a capital letter   some numbers and a symbol you can set this \nto pretty much anything you want i believe   the only requirement is it has to be eight \ndigits long we like to say just set it to be   something that people can't guess but \nis also something you won't forget   this will be case sensitive and that's it that's \nall you need to change on this screen we're going   to go ahead and hit save and then we're going to \nrepeat the process for the 5 gigahertz network and we're going to select the same security \nsettings and we're going to create the password to   match you don't have to have the match but i find \nit's easier to just have one wireless password for   both of my networks it's easier to remember that \nway the next step is that we're going to go up to   the settings screen here and that's going to allow \nus to assign the radios to each of our networks   so 2.4 gigahertz we're gonna uncheck the five \ngigahertz and five gigahertz we're going to   uncheck the 2.4 gigahertz we can leave pretty much \neverything else on this screen as default there's   no need to really change anything else here and \nthis preferred frequency that you see here won't   matter because you don't care about preferred \nfrequency since you'll simply just connect to   the network frequency you want based on the name \nof the network we'll go ahead and hit save here and then you'll see up top here it says \nthat you need to click the apply changes   button we're actually not going to do that yet \nwe're going to go back to the wireless ssid tab and then we're going to delete the pepwave 380 \ndefault network it's going to ask you for sure   we're going to say yes and now we're \ngoing to hit the apply changes button now the modem is deleting the network we are \nconnected to and creating our two new networks   the net result of this is this screen will no \nlonger work it will probably error out and say   cannot connect what we need to do is wait \nremember be patient it's going to get there   it'll reprogram about 30 to 60 seconds and then \nwe're going to click on the wi-fi icon up here   and our new smith wi-fi network or whatever you \nchanged the name to will appear in this list again   this modem is in our corporate office so you can't \nsee it in the list but it will appear once you   click on that network it's going to pop up that \npassword request and this is going to be that   password you set in the wireless configuration tab \nfor your network in our case it was the welcome dollar sign and then hit join i'm not going to \nbecause that's not the password to the network   for me but it would be for you once you join your \nyou're essentially done you're online now you've   got your 2 gigahertz and your 5 gigahertz \nwireless they're configured and ready to go   typically we recommend folks connect their smart \ntvs and things that are cl in close proximity to   the pep wave and that don't move \naround a lot to the 5 gigahertz   laptop computers um that you may want faster \nspeeds for voiceover ip etc would be also   good for five gigahertz and then legacy \ndevices older devices printers amazon echo   stuff like that you would go on the two \ngigahertz typically because that longer range   helps out those devices that may have smaller \nantennas in them all right so your wireless   should be set up optimally thanks so much for \nwatching this video

{"id": "OLJYxFxMJaM", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "ODSJE0mdYZieotsaATmJZ7RWlZE", "transcript": "hey guys in this video we're going to talk about \nwhat is band locking and show you how to do it   now in this video today i want to walk you \nthrough a pep wave device and how you can   specify what channel you want to connect to on \na certain provider or if you're having issue   with a particular channel or a band how to ignore \nthat particular channel now one quick note here   is if you were sent this video by us over \nin customer support or something it might be   because you've already messed with your \nbands and you didn't change it to auto   when you left your last site i'll get into that \nmore in a minute but if you've already kind of   messed with this and you're coming back to this \nvideo for troubleshooting make sure you put it   back to auto when you're done so all right now now \nlet's get into it so band locking is the ability   to basically select a channel that your device \nconnects to each location each tower they can all   have different channels different bands certain \nnetworks have different bands i don't want to   get into all of that here i really just want to \nshow you what and how to do it band locking so   let's jump into the computer and i'll show you \nhow to do that okay now i have connected to my   pep waves wi-fi i have logged in to the dashboard \nif you need help with those steps you can check   out this video up here but let's give you a quick \noverview kind of lay the land of where we are so   i am using a transit duo that is the device \nthat is in the ultimate road warrior package   basically the main difference here is i'm going \nto have two active cell connections i can use at   the same time other devices probably just have one \nand you'll see i have wi-fi as when on and enabled   as a feature uh i am testing a future unit which \nwill be labeled transit 5g here more to come in   a couple of videos later but um such as a future \ndevice for us and really what i want to do is i'm   going to pick on verizon if i was doing testing \nand i was and i was feeling like the speeds were   really slow and i was connected to verizon i knew \nthat was where my issue was from what i would do   is i go into details here and then i can scroll \ndown to this main section i can see banned so   i'm connected to actually two bands with verizon \na primary band of 66 and a secondary band   of two i can get their rssi which is think of \nit like your bars your signal strength is there   um and i can kind of get all of those readings and \ninformation here now for this particular example   i actually want to disable band 66 i let's say \ni'm having issues with it for whatever reason   i'm going to scroll down and i'm going \nto go to band selection and when i hit   custom on that drop down i get an op an option \nbasically of all the bands that we have enabled   to keep it simple all we're going to \ndo is we're going to uncheck band 66   go down and hit save and apply and then we're \ngoing to let the system load for a second   because it's probably going to drop our connection \nbecause we're saying don't use this band anymore   so the modem is going to go see if there's \nother bands in the area it can connect to   it's probably going to take a second yeah see \nwe did lose connectivity went to connecting   we're just going to let it kind of reconnect \nthat modem and we're going to see what we get so it was really quick i didn't even \nprobably have to fast forward this video much   um with we hit details now on verizon \nwe're going to see it's now at van 13   and it's even actually a better signal than it was \nbefore um and we've changed to another secondary   uh bandwidth which you'd expect so that would be a \nquick way to change it now what's super important   is remember when you move locations to turn it \nback to auto you're going to want to probably be   traveling with it on auto so as you move all \nof the bands can be connecting especially as   you move around and when you get to your new site \nyou might need to start over your troubleshooting   again if you even need to now the night before \nor whenever i'm ready and i'm kind of done with   the internet for this particular location i'll \ncome back in here i'll hit back to auto i'll hit   save and apply and then i am done and that means \nit will be automatic next time we go and if i need   to re-troubleshoot and i need to do band selection \nagain in the future that's fine but i know the   system is best set on auto for most locations \nand it's going to kind of pick us up from there   so all right that is the main selection for \nfor bands now a couple keynotes and a couple   of key things key bands that we'd like um to \ntalk about so the first one is going to be   firstnet which for a lot of pep wave devices it \ndoes pick up for my particular one the transit duo   i do pick up the first net band which is band \n14 if you have a t um and so for example if i   wanted to pick up just band 14 um i can go down \nand actually looks like i'm already connected to   band 14 so i wouldn't need to necessarily do \nanything here but if i wanted to force it to   band 14 if i saw it jumping a lot i would do the \nsame steps i'd go down to band selection i would   hit custom in this particular case i would just \nuncheck everything until only band 14 was selected   and then it would basically be locking my \nparticular modem to band 14 and this way i'm   just forcing it on to that particular one now \nwhile although this this might help you um if   something happens to band 14 or this particular \nchannel gets de cluttered or saturated it   doesn't really have an option now to switch to \na different network or a different band so just   be aware although it might fix it temporarily it \ncould cause longer term problems so only do this   if you really feel it's necessary now another \nband to be aware of is band 71 that one is a   t-mobile band now my particular router in this \ndemo does not support band 71 um but you will   find that in the speed demon which is the the pep \nwave transit cat 18 unit and the future 5g models   that that pep wave is putting out those will \nall support the band 71 from what we know at   this point and uh so you could ban lock to that if \nyou felt that that was necessary or needed based   on your connection type um but for the most part \nwe suggest auto unless you feel it's necessary   all right guys that's it this is a short one for \ntoday thank you and we'll see in the next video you", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2021-06-09T16:35:23Z", "channelId": "UCE9KnGK2TcpXLlIi5cQfGvg",

{"id": "fp4Zh-MSsT0", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "PcRPEjNXZPpoiBv-j0bJhK0z2e4", "transcript": "hey guys this is andy from mobile must have and in this video we're going to talk about bandwidth monitoring how to set it up and how to use it [Music] now bandwidth monitoring can be really helpful on a pep wave the main purpose of this is to not allow any one device basically to completely consume your entire network and either cause it to be really slow for everyone else or absorb your limited data plan and just use it all up because it's streaming something in 8k the process to set it up it's not that complicated but it does take a couple of steps so we wanted to walk through it with you on the video now if you like the written instructions for that too there will be a link for a knowledge based article on how to do that but this is just going to be kind of more of that the visual version of it we're going to accomplish kind of three things so one we're going to talk about setting it up and how to do that and some options there then i'm going to show you seems kind of backwards but then how to bypass it if you need to and the reason for the bypass is if you have like your work computer um that you want to always have as fast as it can be or as fast as the network will allow that's kind of why you would ever want to bypass it per machine you can also do it per network lots of options there we'll talk about that too but let's jump to the computer and show you how first to just kind of set that up as with everything we need to start by going to the actual admin console um and then logging in to your unit now if you've already logged in before you've had to change that password so that's going to be something that you set you're first going to be dropped into your dashboard here i'm using a transit cat 18 so it is a single modem device and so i only have one cellular and and wi-fi is when and a wan port if you have a duo you'll probably see two cells if you're on a like a full-timer bundle or that mk2 your skin look fairly similar to this uh with that single single modem okay so the whole idea though is for bandwidth monitoring so to first set that up what we're going to do is go to advanced and then we're going to go down to the bandwidth control here uh we're going to hit enable on this second one down here and this is this is where this works so manager is up here and you can see if it's if a device is in this manager group uh it's unlimited so there's no like restrictions to it and then staff and guest devices we can set restrictions for so now that we've toggled this we want to set this now this is total preference for this number um i vote between eight and five megabytes i put mine at seven that seems to be hd quality for my apple tv streaming um but it's not fuzzy and hairy like it can be at five megabytes um so but you might need you might just play with it so i'm actually i'm probably going to put eight for down and i'm gonna put five for up because we don't really do much in the upload if we're restricting anything and then i'll just do five for guests i don't even have a guest network set up but just in case we do in the future it's already there then i'm gonna hit save you can go and hit apply changes now but we've got a couple other changes to make so we can just do that all at the end so that's really all you need to do to set up basic bandwidth monitoring there if you have the mk2 that's probably going to be where you stop you can't actually do the next step you can just do kind of a global bandwidth limit there um so you might want to set that a little higher if all of your devices are going to be sharing this but again all this is saying is each device can only use eight megabytes down at a time and five up no more um so now for the those of us that have a transit device a cat 18 or one of the transit duos these would be the speed demons and the ultimate road warrior or the road warrior packages what we get here is we can actually create a device tag it to be a manager's device and then give it this unlimited power right so that's kind of cool um first we need to go find what what devices we've gotten so this is a couple of steps but but stay with me so first i'm going to go to the status tab and i'm going to go to my client list i want to look for the device i have set up here um that and i the thing i'm looking for is this ip address so i'm going to label my macbook pro here as a manager device so i can see my address is 19250.10 so dot 10 is the kind of thing i'm looking for um and i'm also going to do a quick thing here of just creating it of this uh this dhcp tag and what that does is is you don't do anything you just hit save once you've hit tag there that says every time this mac address connects please assign it to this ip address and you'll see why in a second so now that we've tagged it and we know it's 50.10 we can go back to our advanced tab and we're going to go to user groups right above bandwidth control where we were before and i'm going to hit add so now i'm going to say this ip address is a manager right so i can type in 192. now it's going to pre-fill in because it knows what i'm uh it knows what's connected and so i can hit that and i can say save now in this particular thing what i also need to do is i'm going to everybody is going to be a staff person so now all devices come in as staff except for the ones i it looks even says if i've actually created a reservation this is new to this update that's nice if i've created a reservation that's going to tag it as a manager and you can force it then to like we did here and and we're good now if you wanted to add more devices same step grab the ip address and then add it as a manager here i'm only going to do it for this one particular device and now i'm going to hit confirm and apply changes so everything's been applied it's not going to do anything it doesn't need to reboot for this particular change but that's it now uh second part to this video is how to look up some usage reports the reason we're doing a lot of this is because the plan i'm using especially in this particular example is actually a data capped plan it only has a hundred gigabytes i can use a month it's this new t-mobile uh 100 gigabyte plan so i need to know how much data have i used in my cycle so to do that i'm going to go to status and i can go down to my usage reports and i'm going to go to monthly for right now and i'm going to make sure my setting is to the cell the cellular sim i've connected it to i only have one in there it's in sim a i'm going to go to total and i want to see it by gigabyte so now i just got this a couple of days ago um so it's going to be fairly new for us but you can see so far i have used 7.5 gigs total towards that hundred um so that's kind of going to be my usage reports over there if i wanted to break it out by day i can do it by day um i can do it by lots of different metrics here now you're going to say well andy what if my setting isn't isn't the first to the 31st what if i have a different monthly cycle that my usage is counted off of fair point let's go show you how to set that up too and that will move us to part three of this video which is showing you how to set up bandwidth limits or or bandwidth monitoring on your particular sim card and i'm going to hit details on the cell tab i'm going to scroll down i'm going to go over to this third grouping called cellular settings this is where we're going to change these settings here the most important one i'm going to set up is bandwidth monitor allowance i'm going to enable that i'm going to hit ok on my disclaimer and this is where we get some some of our cool settings so basically we're going to disconnect when usage hits a hundred percent uh if you want email notifications on when usage hits 75 and 90 you can allow this we have a separate article for that and that's linked in the written portion uh for this video so view the link below and then that'll take you there but now my billing for my plan actually is going to start on the 20th so that's when my usage restarts every month with t-mobile is on the 20th so i'm going to go and i'm going to stay restarted on the 20th and my total gigs is a hundred and that's really it i just have to hit save at the bottom um and this one doesn't require us to hit apply changes that is going to be saved so as soon as this sim card hits its usage allowance it's going to force it to disconnect and it does a couple important things that forces us not to go over so we can't get build any overages fees depending on the plan and how that works uh or you can't get your plan shut off or terminated for overusage and abuse so it's a really good way to set that up if i now go back over to status i can actually view my usage by that data plan date i set up so i'm going to go to status and month and i can now have a new option for billing cycle up at the top and it's going to switch because only one lan kind of setting has a billing cycle and now i can see based on this what is my total usage for this time frame so uh there you go so those are kind of your three main sections so how to set up bandwidth monitoring how to bypass it per device i guess four sections because then it's going to be usage reports and then how to set up your bandwidth enabling for shutoff so there you go guys as always if you have any questions it's best to probably shoot us an email at info mobilemusthave.com or chat with us on our support page um and we will get back to you soon as we can if you leave a comment below we'll get back to you too but it just takes us a little longer we have a lot of other uh

{"id": "gme9TR0gAf0", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "ptpHdjffxcmKccplEO6_DBN5UxM", "transcript": "[Applause] howdy so welcome to breckenridge uh in this video we are going to be talking about antennas uh we have basically all the antennas with us that we sell here at mobile must have and i wanted to walk through what is the pros and cons of each antenna which one might be right for you and which one kind of goes with the right bundle so uh sit down relax grab i guess a cup of um hot cocoa and we'll get started so the idea here is to go through each antenna show you what it is a little bit more about that antenna and what its best use case is now each of these antennas are typically already going to be in one of the bundles you might see on our site we've got stuff from the essentials the full timer bundle the speed demon bundle and the ultimate road warrior bundle but you'll notice there's different versions of each one and usually the only difference is which antenna is going with it so we're going to do a quick summary of each antenna and you can then hopefully make a better decision on which antenna will be right for you okay first antenna we're going to start with is the pointing now the pointing is the one i have installed on my rv it's a little blown out you should be able to see it right above kind of where the patio is and that's the antenna we've had installed for a year and it's been fantastic if you want to see how i installed it you can see the video here um and it's been a really great option for us some of the great things about the pointy antenna is it's so versatile out of the box on ways to install it obviously you can go with the most standard which is the way i've done it which is the cable straight out the bottom and i'll show you as an example just like you can see on this one where the cables come right out the bottom that would be very standard and probably the most common use case but what's great about the pointing is it can do a flush exit mount i'm going to pull a clip from another video we've made here um and you can see the cables are going to come directly out the back and what that allows you to do is stick the antenna directly on the roof this would be good for air streams or good for advancement you might not be able to drill through so easily and then the cables can go through another entrance whether that's a refrigerator vent a tank vent any sort of other vent you might have a solar drop you already have existing uh the cables can come right out the back here's a picture of one two um and they can go through an existing one same antenna no options no extra anything needed um and that's that's a great feature for this antenna uh the final thing you can add as an option uh would be magnet mounts so whether you're doing a drop down uh for the cables or flush out the back you can add these little magnets in and the magnets will allow it to stick to any sort of metal surface great for van builds or something again with that with that top surface now one key note here with the pointings is they do not require a grounding plane the grounding plane is going to be typically just a metal sheet uh that you would put in between your roof uh and the antenna and it's not for electrical grounding it's more actually for directional signal into the antenna that's why you need that metal kind of bouncing plate uh but the pointing like i said does not need one it has one built in which is a great feature you don't have to add anything else to it so one important note with the pointings as of at least december of 2020 is they do not have a 600 megahertz feature that means it's not going to do some of these newer 5g bands this might be updated check the description below if that has changed we will add that there but at this time they don't have a feature or an option for that all right and then the last final note here is the cable that comes attached is going to be 6.8 feet that is going to be the standard length for all of our antennas um except if i say something different but that's 6.8 feet 3 meters is going to be the default length for our antennas and if you're going to do the install like you saw in my video i did that bead of dicor around the edge and i think that's a really good extra kind of waterproofing layer for these antennas one it will actually add a little bit of adherence since dicor so sticky will help if there's any issue with the sticky pad for that antenna going anywhere but two you just want to make sure you're not going to have any water going into your roof and causing future damage so just putting an extra layer of dye core around this uh around the antenna i think is a great option and that's going to be true for any of the following antennas we talked about i think if you're installing something on the roof of your rv use dicor assuming if you have kind of more of a standard rv roof or silicone if you're doing something metal like on a van okay that's it for pointing now let's go to mobilewalk so this is going to be the mobilemark antenna from a size standpoint it's going to be a little bit smaller it's definitely a lower profile and it's not thin shaped or at least as fin shaped as the pointing one i think this is a great option for smaller uh roofs just in general it just takes a little bit less profile up and so that can really make a big difference this does have a couple different mounting options now you can only have the cables come out the bottom like this you don't have all of the mounting options you did with the pointing um but this does have an optional pull mount um you can buy with it so if you wanted to mount it let's say on the side of a roof rack or something like that you can get a pole mount and then this will mount to a pole that's also popular for boats if you've got any sails or something like that and you wanted an all-directional omnidirectional antenna you can do that with this and this will mount to a pole now same as before this is a 6.8 foot cable that comes with this by default however with mobilemark they do offer a customized length option you can go to uh the product and i can link this one below for the custom link um and so you can get this really as long as you need now we do always recommend going with the shortest length possible 6.8 feet is a really good kind of uh a good midway um the shorter your distance is with the cable run the better the overall signal improvement you are going to get from this antenna and that's true for all antennas in general um so yeah so this is the the mobile work now one thing with the mobile mark on the installs is it does require a metal surface to mount to if you're putting it on top of an rv like this you're going to need the grounding plane that you can buy as an option with it or if it's going right on top of a van roof no problem you can just mount it directly to that metal roof too final note with this is the mobile marks do support the lower 600 frequency so that's going to give you band 71 support for t-mobile um so just kind of keep that in mind if you're going t-mobile or think you might have a t-mobile plan and the router you have selected like the speed demon one supports that um this has that 600 megahertz support now if you have an older one it might not have that 600 that's for all new ones kind of as of november um for for at least from for mobile must have they do have two different models so if you're looking um just make sure you get the uh the right one with the 600 megahertz if you're buying it from us that's the main one we sell so you shouldn't have any issues but just be aware of that all right so this is the mobile mark also final note it comes in black if you're looking for a black antenna you can get this in white or black okay and this is the last omnidirectional antenna we do in bundles and this is called the parsec antenna now from a size difference you can see the parsec is quite a bit bigger than the mobile mark the height wise it's not that much different but um i mean just the diameter in general is going to be quite a bit uh quite a bit bigger you do get a pretty big advantage with that the mobile mark and the pointing antenna from before have almost identical performance see they're kind of equal in the performance realm um this guy will give you quite a bit of a performance boost and that's mainly because they're bigger they can pick up weaker signals and it just helps overall in some of those areas when i tested it on rv we saw about a 10 decibel gain just by using this antenna over the pointing could have been where i was we're doing more testing on it um but that is what we're seeing which is pretty exciting considering um it's still omnidirectional now this is also a 701 so you're going to get you get all your cables coming out the back they're all individual and they're all pretty small so you don't need the largest hole but probably an inch and a quarter is what we see for most of these 701 cables i mean you can see the gps one is dangling independently now the parsec on the back does have this big sticky pad so it works very similar to the way the pointing installed which again you can see in that video but again i would always recommend doing that dicor edge one key thing to keep in mind with the parsec antenna is it comes with 15 feet of cable over the six and a half 6.8 feet in the other ones um just because this is where it's manufactured and how it's made they only come in a 15 foot option so if you need a little bit longer of a cable and say seven feet or 6.8 feet is not going to work for you uh this could be an option i have found that if you're going to add that 15 foot extension to like the mobile mark or the or the pointing you're going to be i think within a close range of just going with the parsec anyways so for a performance boost and a longer cable just check it it might be close to a break even for you and then with the performance gain you're actually end up on top with that so just do the price comparison depending on what bundle you're looking at um and this might be a good option final note with this is this also supports that lower 600 frequency support so if you're looking for that nationwide 5g t-mobile band uh this would be a good option you can pick that up again another the speed demon bundle does support band 71 so you could this is a good option for that and that's why we put this in these in the plus bundles the road warrior plus uh ultimate road ware plus and the speed demon plus just because it's just got such a better boost on it now um if you're looking for a magnet mount option with a parsec it does come with it but it is a fully it's a completely different antenna this is the same parsec antenna but with a magnet mount option so you can see it's it's the same overall shape and size it's literally the same antenna but when you buy it they actually pre-mount the magnet to it it's here's what it looks like from the side um so it adds it's about five inches um top to bottom and then each of these pads are where the magnets are now if your roof is unlevel you can twist these and make them level like each one kind of twist on like the like a couch foot or something where you can kind of chair foot where you can level it um so you can kind of work with the divots in the roof depending on how that van is is set up you can do that and then the cables from the bottom here will just come flush out just like you would see in the pointing where they just will they will mount flush so the cables will come right out so i think that's a really great option if you're looking for this big performance boost in the in the parsec but you need something with a magnet mount option this is a good solution final note with the parsec is they do come with a pole mount option um so you can check uh the link i'll link below for that mount but it's also an option with all the antennas if you're looking for a pole mount these do support it they also support a wall mount so the basically the way the mount and i just grabbed this one because it's lighter and at least easier to show the wall mount will actually um kind of come out this way and then stay flush with the side so you can mount it directly up against the wall and have that mount uh attached and then you have all your cables coming down you have to manage those all right so there is the antenna lineup as we have it here at mobile wants to have you have the pointing the mobile mark and the parsecs now the ones i showed today are all seven and one antennas and those are gonna be really solid for anything that needs a four by four uh memo or if you're doing two two by two nemo routers those would be good that would be your like transit duos that have two uh two modes built in each modem has two cell antennas so you need four total also the cat 18 transit from pep wave is also going to be a four by four again all the ones i showed today are going to be compatible with that now if you're looking at something like the full timer bundle or or depending on another another router that might only need two lte antennas a lot of these come in a five in one configuration you can get the pointing the mobile mark and there's actually one called a pep wave puma that come in a five in one configuration and that would be two lte two wi-fi and one gps um and then pointing actually has a three in one and a two in one so depending on what router you're trying to mix that with uh we can make sure we have the right antenna for you um if you have any questions all right guys well thank you for hanging out with me my hands are so cold i cannot feel them so i'm gonna go inside and if you have any questions though the best place to reach out to us is actually info at mobilemusthave.com and we will be happy to answer any of your questions

about the pepwave max br1 ent cat 12 mobile router that's a mouthful [Music] so i'm super excited to share this modem with folks because a lot of people don't even know it exists and it is a super feature packed unit that has stuff that a lot of our other more popular units don't have so going over kind of the summary of what you see in front of you we've got our standard barrel connector 12 volt power source our ent prime care pep wave mobile router unit our gps antenna and two cellular antennas and my screwdriver which we'll use in a minute you might notice we're missing something you usually see in these videos which is wi-fi antennas and that's because the ent does not have wi-fi and that's probably why most people decide to go with another model but that might be a mistake and we're going to explain why so we're going to start with just a high level overview of the unit itself turning it around for a minute what we've got here is something unique that you don't typically see on this smaller chassis which is a usb port now this is a wan usb port meaning that we can connect a secondary usb based cellular modem to this device we'll get back to that we've got two lan ports a step up from our mk2 sort of younger brother of this model that is for connecting you know wired computers or ip cameras or whatnot to the unit that something that doesn't have wi-fi or something you want to be more stable and not use wi-fi and then we've got our standard wan port for connecting wired internet that would be where you'd input like a cable modem or your standard wired input like with all of our pepwave devices mac series devices your wan port is assignable back to a lan port meaning you can have a total of three wired ports on this device which is quite nice you've got your 12 volt dc input here you will notice there are a few more ports here for machine and machine communication or serial communication that might be useful for folks that are you know trying to put these in atms or do other sorts of relay based things with that port but for today we're just going to keep that simple and say that's where you would connect your optional power input something you very unique to this model is that it supports up to a 56 volt input and that means it'll do p o e or power over ethernet output so if you use the optional power adapter that can plug into this barrel available on our website you can enable poe on these ports or power over ethernet now what that can do is that can allow you to connect an ap1 mini or ap1ax high powered access point inside of your rv to give you more powerful wi-fi than you would get in the included wi-fi antennas that are in the mk2 or the transit series lines the little ap1 mini i believe is 25 decibels of of transmission power and the ap1ax is even more so if you're looking for high output powered wi-fi using these poe ports and an external access point can be a great way to go moving on on this modem continuing to the back of the unit looks pretty standard again minus those wifi antenna ports we've got our two cellular antennas and our gps antenna the big difference here is that the modem included in the ent is a category 12 modem so we're stepping up from what we see in our full timer bundle and in the mk2 from 300 megabits of max download to 600 so we're doubling the theoretical speed or capacity of the modem we still have our two sim card slots in this model so like with other models we can install let's say this is an at t sim or we can pull that out flip it over slot b if we had a second sim we could put our verizon sim and we'd be off to the races with multiple carriers this is a single modem device so you will be selecting sim a or symbi from the management console or from the app on your phone you will not be using them at the same time but it is a multiple carrier supported device so att t-mobile sprint verizon visible cricut all supported we've had it also working with the google fi network and with category 12 you're going to have access to additional cellular bands that might be important to you depending on your need this is also a firstnet mobile ready device so if you're an at t customer you can take advantage of band 14 which is that firstnet rural band typically reserved for first responders but according to att also available to the public when there is not an emergency so that's a big benefit and step up from the mk2 now if you're looking at the transit models from say our ultimate road warrior bundles those are great units and they're super popular and from an all-in-one perspective they are awesome but if you're looking at possibly thinking about 5g in the future you might want to look at the ent because of this usb port you can get that nice super fast cat 12 modem in the back with the reliability of knowing you don't have to have anything tethered but then when you're ready to step up to possibly tinkering around with 5g you can connect an external modem via this usb port like a little mifi hotspot those typically support usb tethering can connect up to this usb port and you'll be able to then have a dual cellular modem device using the usb and the cat 12 in the back so there you have it the ent is an absolutely awesome model to look at if you're thinking about you know wi-fi is wan and campground wi-fi pickup is not something you really care that much about adding a small access point to this the ap one minis i think 149 dollars can turn this into a an awesome powerhouse and you know you've got the poe ports and you've got that dual modem capability and 5g future proofing with that usb port killer model for the right customer we love it thank you so much for watching this video guys if you have any

{"id": "pM-VBy0TDXA", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "eEWMbAkGgq0rbTr_0bDXp0-eRiM", "transcript": "hi eric with mobilemusthave.com and livenlight.net here today to talk to you about the pepwave max br1 pro all right let's get started going through a summary of what we see here we've got again what pep link's kind of claim to fame is wow a heavy-duty metal ruggedized construction mobile router two cellular antennas two wi-fi antennas a gps antenna and a four pin uh 110 volt power input adapter comes standard with the kit we also sell a 12 volt direct wire three amp fuse 10 foot direct wire cable option as well at mobilemusthave.com that's an exclusive to our store now what makes the br1 pro a popular unit for mobile enthusiasts well to be honest it's very similar to the max br1 mk2 which is kind of its little brother the biggest difference that this modem has is that it has more lan ports on the front of the unit so as you can see here we've got four lan ports these are all gigabit lan ports and then our standard wan port for connecting wired uh internet sources like maybe a cable modem or a dsl line like with all of the mac series models this fifth port here can be reassigned from the wan port to an additional lan port so that's very unique to the pep wave line especially in this tiny compact form factor the ability to have an integrated five port switch essentially so if you have a need for wired ports this could be very attractive as an option for you kind of moving on we've got our standard complement on the front of what we typically see here our wi-fi ports are on the outer side here we've got our 2.4 gigahertz or 5 gigahertz wi-fi our cellular which is our cellular amb this is powered by a category 6 cellular modem and our gps antenna port a couple things that make this slightly unique we don't see on some of the other models we've got screw ports here for a wall mount access it does come with four rubber feet here if you want to just mount it on a table we've got our 12 volt direct power input here again with a removable plug that we love that allows you to leave that nice screw down 12 volt power but still remove the unit if you need to make it portable or just reboot it that is a nice touch there and then over here standard to our pep wave models is our sim slot so we pump that open and again like in our mk2 we have our dual sim slots so we can take full size 2ff don't put a small sim in to slot a here up at the top we could load that with say a t and then we have our slot down below we'll flip that sim over continue to have the notch inward and click that in and we could have say verizon and sim b the category six modem in this unit is compatible with all major carriers we've had it working and functional with att sprint t-mobile verizon cricket visible we've had it working with the google phi network it works with quite a few different cellular bands which are described in the description but the the auto failover in the pepperlink products gives you the ability to put into sim cards and then at a press of a button use it either using their mobile app or using a standard web browser to switch from sim a to sim b with approximately 30 seconds of downtime hopping between cellular carriers which is a very unique feature to the peplink line now the peplink max br1 pro does have one unique difference than the mk2 besides this 5 port switch and that is that these wi-fi 2.4 or 5 gigahertz wi-fi work at either 2.4 gigahertz or 5 gigahertz not both at the same time like the mk2 does that is typically why the mk2 is slightly more popular for just kind of an easy quick all-in-one solution but the pro can really step it up for the right use case and i'll explain one right now what we see a lot of customers do with this modem is they assign this wi-fi to a roof antenna like our poynting five and one series or our mobile mark five and one series um or even our our parsec seven and one series and they assign these wi-fi ports at the 2.4 gigahertz range to the roof antenna because it's not trying to do two and five gigahertz at the same time we do find that the wi-fi is wan functionality for connecting to campground wi-fi can sometimes be more reliable they then pick up a ap1 small interior access point and they connect that up to one of these lan ports so now they have a dedicated roof 2.4 gigahertz for the wi-fi as when and then they have a smaller ap1 access point inside the rig broadcasting on a different channel that can be a very good mix to get you the best of both worlds while also giving you that five port switch that will be powered and running on 12 volts instead of most five port switches that are going to have to run on 110 volts so it is a nice blend but we do want to make sure you're aware that the two or five gigahertz wi-fi is going to run at one frequency or another not both at the same time the max br1 pro includes pepwave's proprietary auto failover technology so you can have say wi-fi as wan connected to campground wi-fi in priority one and then your cellular modem in priority two meaning that if your campground wi-fi fails it will automatically fail over to the cellular that can be very helpful if you have nest cameras or something else inside your rv or a temperature sensor for your pets and you want to make sure that if something occurs or fails in the campground wi-fi that you auto fail over that's built into these modems the additional option that you can do with auto failover is something called load balancing what that means is you can drag your campground wi-fi and your cellular wi-fi both into priority one and it will balance the campground wi-fi and the cellular across all of your devices so your computer might go out the campground wi-fi and your s and your phone might go out the cellular they won't combine the bandwidth but they will load balance meaning you'll have more bandwidth overall accessible to all of your devices because some will use one connection and some will use another nice feature of this modem that concludes the summary overview of the max br1 pro if you have any specific questions about this model any concerns anything at all please go to mobilemusthave.com and you can start up a chat with me or one of our agents in the bottom right hand corner you can also email us at info

{"id": "YFArPIrRIkY", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "-VduOYLXT9DNQ9nQMPJEelfTom4", "transcript": "hi this is eric with livenlight.net and mobilemusthave.com and today we've got our full-time internet bundle [Music] okay so we've got everything here that is included in our full-time bundle and in this video we'll go through what each of these components do and what this bundle is best used for so why do we call it the full-time bundle well we could have called it like the for every rv or bundle or something like that but full timer just sounded better this is like our flagship product that for the most part is a general fit for the vast majority of our customers it does a lot of stuff has a nice middle of the road price point and works for the vast majority of our customers this bundle was developed and designed to solve the biggest question or need that the core of our customers wanted to do with mobile internet which is they wanted to be able to get online they wanted to be able to have it work mostly like home internet and they didn't want to be technology experts and they didn't want to think about the technology they wanted to get on with their trip or their vacation and have this be an extension of that allowing them to continue to stay connected to the outside world as such the full-time bundle was developed to do that for the most part now there's nothing on the market that's going to work exactly like home internet because we don't have a wire coming in from the telephone or cable company but this is currently one of the best answers we have for folks who are not looking to be techies as i said before but just want the internet to work so let's get into what all of this stuff does so this is the heart of our system this is our pepwave max br1 mk2 mobile cellular router it has the ability to use multiple internet sources to connect you to the internet and as you can see that's metal military grade hardware designed to just work we've got some antennas here that come with the equipment a 110 volt power adapter if you want to run it on shore power or bring it inside to a cabin after you get your rv to a particular destination you want to bring this with you 12 volt power cable which is exclusive to mobile must have this allows you to wire the unit directly into your house batteries a gps antenna here that lock that acts a lot like low jack would we'll explain that a little bit in the in a minute and a roof antenna that has five antennas all in this one housing we'll talk about that more as well one of the biggest complaints we hear from customers that are coming from little mifi hotspot devices besides the fact that they don't always get very good signal is that they have to reboot them all the time the reason for that usually is because the components inside of it are designed to not be on 24 hours a day they're also not designed to support a lot of devices when you add up your computers your phones your smart tvs and all of the other smart things that you might be traveling with you'd be surprised how many devices you have on average we see it's about 20 to 35 or so devices in the average full timer's arsenal this pep wave device is designed for up to 60 devices and quite frankly we've had it run over 100 devices without an issue because of that military-grade hardware that's designed for police ambulance and fire and yes is also used by military it is absolutely built to not have to be rebooted and messed with a lot it's just designed to work geeking out for a second we're going to give you an overview of the pepwave mobile router here and all of the different ports that are included on it on this front side here we've got our wi-fi a and b ports now this is not for cellular these are wi-fi so this is broadcasting locally inside of your rv to give you a private secure wi-fi network this modem supports two gigahertz which is a longer range wi-fi and five gigahertz which is a slightly shorter range but faster wi-fi and it is dual channel meaning it can support more devices moving on a little bit this green terminal port here if you pull on it is actually the plug for your 12 volt power input and it is labeled there with a negative and a positive for your 12 power in that works in conjunction with this cable that we include and at the top of this green port there are small screwdriver inlets for an eyeglass screwdriver to tighten down the connectors to give yourself 12 volt power but still retain the ability to unplug and plug it back in if you want to take it on the go without having to use that screwdriver we've got a single lan port here lan is for local area network or for connecting your computer to the wired internet that this will provide if you don't want to run it on wireless if you've got a desktop computer or a laptop using a wired connection typically is more reliable so if you're doing voice over ip calling or you're working from the road that's a great way to wire in that computer this port over here is a wan port so if you do come across a campground or you're going home and you want to use a cable modem or another wired internet connection dsl whatever you can plug it into this wan port if you don't foresee yourself ever using any wired internet like a lot of us people on the road don't this can be reassigned to a second lan port so you can connect more wired devices to this unit a lot of flexibility it's just a simple check box in the administrative console over here we've got our power port our standard barrel connector with 12 volt power it goes right there this unit will accept anywhere from 10 to 30 volts dc so if you have done a 24 volt solar setup you can run this device on that 24 volt system without issue if you're looking if you have a 48 volt solar system take a look at our speed daemon and ultimate road warrior bundles because those will run at higher voltage but sticking with this one flipping us around to the other side we've got three more ports for antennas these two out here are our cellular antenna ports and this one in the middle is for gps now underneath this cover here is where we have our ports for sim cards sim cards like what you get from att verizon t-mobile sprint all those guys every single internet device typically will come will have a sim card inside of it and this device takes what are called two ff or full size sim cards this is one from att what's nice about this modem is it is carrier agnostic meaning it will run on just about any carrier you can run it on att verizon sprint t-mobile qriket visible we've had them running on google phi just about anything you can think of this is a category 6 modem so it has a max download speed of 300 megabits per second so it's pretty fast and an upload speed of 50 megabits per second so this will get the job done to give you kind of a a reality check on bandwidth download speeds if you want to stream like a nice netflix movie that'll use around four to five megabits so having more than that uh like 300 as your max is plenty it's not gonna i'm not ex i'm not telling you that you're gonna get 300 but that's not because of the modem that's because of the cellular companies and what they're willing to give you because you're sharing it with everybody else now the industry average is around for this modem we typically see folks get anywhere from 12 in very saturated areas sometimes a little lower if it's a tower issue all the way up to 60 70 80. plenty for netflix and doing just about anything you want to do on the internet while traveling you've got two sim card slots here very very flexible so i can load up an at t sim here press that in it'll click and lock and then i could just imagine that this is say a verizon sim flip that over press that in click and lock load a second carrier into the sim b slot so that means that from your administration page you can actually switch between multiple carriers takes about 30 seconds so a lot of folks will pick up a high capacity data plan from one of the carriers maybe a hundred gig plan or one of our high data limit plans on our store pop that in sim a and then a more limited less less expensive say verizon sim and sim b to use for emergencies maybe they only get 15 gigs or 20 gigs on that secondary sim but they have both so if they go into a coverage area where say at t or t-mobile doesn't work they can just flip over to their verizon sim the flexibility of those dual sims is one of the reasons why our products are so popular another key benefit of our system over most of our competitor systems is that all of our sensitive electronics are inside of your coach including where you install your sim cards if you look at some of our competitive products they're sticking all of the guts of their technology outside up on the roof and exposed to the elements so they're sitting there baking in the sun they're sitting there exposed to water snow and everything else and they have in my opinion a pretty high failure rate as a result why did they do that it's very simple it's so that you could run a simple 12 volt wire down to the regular 12 volt power for the manufacturer to have an easy installation it's cheaper for them it's not necessarily in our opinion the right way to do it by installing an antenna on the roof that has electronics in it but nothing that requires power it's like a regular antenna like your car antenna has that's been you know time tested for quite a few years and then running that down with a wire bundle and keeping your sensitive electronics inside your coach that's going to cut down on problems in the future okay so let's kind of discuss all of the accessories here we're going to take this roof antenna here and move it off to the side and talk about that in a minute now a lot of our customers are intimidated by the roof antenna concept and the idea of drilling a hole in the roof don't worry we'll explain how that works but before we even talk about that you can get yourself online and get moving with a better internet solution without installing the roof antenna on day one we'll explain how that works so included in this kit you have these paddle antennas we kind of call them stubby antennas these wider ones will go on your cellular ports doesn't matter which ones you pick cellular a and b they'll just screw right into the cell ports and then they have the ability to be angled up typically i recommend to folks to position them like that so that one's facing that way and one's that way and then your wi-fi antennas will go here now these antennas are two decibel gain antennas that doesn't sound like a lot but in the world of cellular two decibels is almost 75 to 100 percent more signal strength so simply by adding these antennas you're giving yourself a serious advantage over a mifi device or using your phone as a hotspot device these antennas are going to give you a lot more coverage with your cellular network and these antennas are going to give you a lot more distance that you can transmit that local wi-fi right out of the box now because the device wasn't designed to run on a little tiny battery like your phone the transmitters and the receivers on the cellular and the wi-fi side are also more powerful than you'll find in a wi-fi i'm sorry a mifi hotspot or a phone that's a big reason why people turn these on and just say wow i'm getting three bars or four bars where on my phone i only have two a lot of that's because of the transmission power in this unit and a lot of it's because of the two decibel gain antennas you're also getting a much better piece of software running in here and better quality components with that metal unit there that is designed and developed to be in uh commercial use applications so it's going to just run better the gps antenna here is optional if you do install it you can view the location of your vehicle on the secure cloud based in control website you can disable that with just a little drag and drop in the admin console if you don't want to use it or simply just don't connect the antenna and you'll be fine it won't create any errors or cause any problems but it is there and available if you want to use it the addition of these stubby antennas included with the kit also means that if you do permanently install this in an rv you can take it on the go with you if you'd like and just grab these antennas rather than having to deal with this big roof antenna now let's discuss the roof antenna and again you don't need to install it on day one but it's a game changer once you get it installed so we'll talk about kind of how that works we'll talk about the installation in a second we'll start with just a high level overview the antenna has five antennas in one as i discussed and it is an omnidirectional antenna even though it looks kind of shark finney it is not a directional antenna so you can install it pretty much in any direction you want on the roof best practices stay a minimum of 18 inches away from any air conditioner motors or anything that might create interference and if possible try to elevate it above any rails on your roof although that is not necessarily required it can just increase your cellular signal if that is something that you can do a lot of folks will purchase a junction box and install that and then put the antenna on top of it if they have a a higher end rv that has a rail system or an integrated gerard awning or something like that again not required but it can help with your cell signal moving on to the antenna if you look here on the bottom we've got a channel out the back here these wires can be relocated to come out the back of the antenna here all the equipment that's necessary to do that is included or you can have it come straight down using the spigot mount here a lot of folks worry about this nut here saying how am i going to if i drill a hole in the roof get to this nut and go up and attach it you actually don't have to use that nut in most applications it's provided they're mostly for small thin sheet metal roofs like in a fire engine or in a particular application where you had access to a metal roof but you don't need to install that you can simply unscrew that run that off the bottom and then use this which is a dual adhesive mount to hold down the antenna simply clean the roof with a nice solvent to get it nice and clean and then this double-sided 3m tape here will hold the antenna in place without issue for good measure we typically recommend a bead of dicor around just to prevent any leaks although we haven't heard of anyone having any problems that's just something that does tend to add an additional layer of protection in addition to the adhesive mount you may be wondering what these six holes are these are for our optional magnet mount kit you can add six magnets to this kit have the wires run out the back and have a more portable use case for this antenna just do away with the adhesive mount that you're not going to use pop on those six magnets run the wires out the back and you're off to the races one moving on to the antenna leads it's pretty straightforward we've got five uh antenna ports here two for wi-fi those are your green guys here two purple for cellular those are right here and your one gps they hook up right to the modem ports and you just match up the labels it's it's not something you have to worry about you know well there's two of these is there an a and a b don't worry about it you'll be absolutely fine before we wrap up on these connectors i do want to mention these adapters that come with the antenna that are for pepwave model series routers on the wi-fi connectors the reason why they didn't simply just make the connectors attached to this is because certain model modems use what are called rpsma and some use sma the pin in the middle is just reversed so they give you the adapter so that you can connect it to a pep wave and you're future proofed for if you ever move to a different model that uses the other option to connect this up it's very simple you would just remove your wi-fi which is the smaller antenna here screw on that adapter just like that nice and easy and then your green uh wi-fi ports from there will just screw right on and you are done the benefits of the roof antenna do not stop with cellular you also have wi-fi antennas in here as i mentioned before so why do you need wi-fi antennas outside and up on the roof well cellular is great and it's typically the primary way you connect to the internet today and most mobile internet use applications but there are times where you want to connect to campground wi-fi and having an antenna outside and up on the roof is going to give you a much better shot of connecting to that wi-fi a lot of folks think campground wi-fi is terrible and it honestly is most of the time but a lot of parks have invested money and time into their wi-fi to make it better and part of the reason why people think it's still not that good is because they're connecting to it with those tiny little antennas built into their laptop screen by putting your receiver up on the roof you can connect to that campground wi-fi much further away and have a much better experience with wi-fi obviously you also get the gps antenna here if you do decide to take advantage of the gps it'll be a bit more accurate because of the roof mounted location that pretty much does it for the overview video of our

{"id": "nPhyf3s92gU", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "EWJPZ2iMMxNugLQ4cCeDQJ14rvg", "transcript": "hi this is eric with mobilemusthave.com and livenlight.net and today we're going to show you the balance 30 pro by peplink all right let's get this puppy unboxed as you can see here the balance 30 pro comes with some unique features in the the world of peppling and that's part of the reason why we recommend this uh it can be used for mobile but it's very commonly used for our rural home users we've got a total of six antennas we've got our four wi-fi antennas here two cellular antennas we'll talk about that in a minute our ac power adapter our modem itself uh brackets for this to be wall mounted uh or for it to be rack mounted inside of a server rack and then four remote location access points for your wireless antennas essentially what these are is magnets on the bottom they don't need to be stuck to anything metal but they can be and then you can install your wi-fi antennas here to give yourself a little bit more antenna uh distance for additional coverage in this unit all right let's move these accessories off to the side and talk about the high level functionality of this router quick feature overview of what we see here we've got four wi-fi antenna ports here for distribution of your local internet these are ac a b g n dual channel 5 gigahertz and 2.4 gigahertz wi-fi supported chipsets inside of this model we have four lan ports here uh and we have two wan wired ports that's a little bit unique for uh the stuff that we sell at mobile must have um and then we also have a usb uh wan port that could be used to add an additional cellular modem to this on the back of this unit we have our two cellular ports our sim card port let's open that up this unit does have a category 6 modem in it with a max download throughput of 300 megabits per second not our fastest unit but this is actually a pretty pretty good unit and something that a lot of folks use if they want to have wired internet or multiple wired internet sources coming into their home and then use cellular as backup 300 megabits pretty fast though so for a max three put the cat6 does pretty well uh much better than the category fours the reason we like this as kind of a total package solution is because of just how much power in a couple areas which we'll go over and just versatility this model has it does have a couple weaknesses that we'll go into not weaknesses but optional licenses that might make another uh model more attractive depending on your scenario but we're going to start with kind of what this can do really well now one thing this has that a lot of other models don't including the balance 20x which is very popular is multiple wan ports meaning you can have multiple wired internet sources coming into this modem that can be pretty important for folks with rural home needs especially if you're running a home office maybe you have like a dsl line and a cable line coming in or a dsl and fiber and you're looking for failover capabilities for your for your rural area connection or your standard office connection if you're using residential internet because you have these dual wham ports you can fail over uh your connection to not only the wired ports but also to your cellular ports meaning you could have say your cable modem as your primary your dsl as your secondary uh and uh your you know third could be the cellular uh modem back here if both of your wire connections failed a lot of rural areas have the same central office used for both carriers so that can happen and then you could even have a second cellular with your usb port connected to a hotspot to give you a fourth internet connection so four wand sources right out of the box for failover is quite a bit for a uh for a small kind of router like this another benefit of the balance 30 pro over say the balance 20x as an example is that these are power over ethernet capable ports on the front of the unit that does require an optional power adapter out of the box this just comes with a 12 volt adapter but they do sell a 56 volt version of that and if you plug that into the same port on the back of this unit it will enable these four lan ports on the front 2b power over ethernet for a rural home cabin or a small office that can come in very handy you can power voiceover ip phones you can power cameras like security cameras or you can power additional access points to cover additional areas of the property with more wi-fi using our ap1 mini or our ap1 ax access points that are optional but can be powered here without additional power adapters because this unit has four wireless antenna ports here it can support quite a few clients on the wireless and because of these uh included extension cables for your antenna you can your antennas out quite a bit to increase the coverage of the unit in your particular installation uh case scenario you can also pick up some sma male to female extension cables from us and you can run wires further away than the six feet included here to give yourself some additional coverage if you're going to run wires more like a lot of folks would uh use that to possibly run one of these to the exterior of a cabin so that they had wireless transmission outside and you can absolutely do that if you're going to go over 20 or so feet or 25 feet on that cable if you were going to purchase that i'd recommend going with a secondary access point with the power over ethernet option i discussed earlier you could add up to 300 feet with category 5 wire to go just about anywhere in a home or category 6 would go even further if that was needed this modem does support speed fusion bonding as well but it is an optional license most people don't need that who are looking for a modem like this they can simply use the failover functionality to use one internet at a time but if you found you needed it in the future you wouldn't be buying yourself another unit you could enable that function the license is fairly expensive to enable it i believe it's close to the cost of the router so you would be looking at approximately a cost of eight hundred dollars for the speedfusion license to be unlocked on this but for the right rural case scenario that could give you a lot of horsepower the case the use case that comes to my mind immediately is if you're in a rural area where possibly dsl is your only access or something like that is your only ability to access the internet you could actually purchase multiple dsl lines say if each one had a 20 megabit download max you could purchase two of them and then bond them with the speed fusion licensing allowing you to combine both of those wired connections not stopping there if you did go with the speedfusion license you could then combine your usb cellular and your cat6 cellular into four simultaneous connections just be mindful that that sounds great but you want to make sure you've got enough bandwidth on those cellular plans to take advantage of that it can be done though so that's quite an interesting uh feature of this unit the balance 30 pro has a max consumption of 28 watts of power so it's it's not terrible um it can be run on a 12 volt power source so we we sell the uh barrel adapters that would allow you to connect that up directly to 12 volt or 24 volt power if you're running a 20 24 volt solution and this can be wall mounted inside of a mobile use or inside of a wiring closet using the included adapters here or it has screw ports on the bottom to wall mount it as well for any type of public use you can hook this up to the k lock port on the back here to secure this from theft or unauthorized removal and you've got a nice feature here which i love that they put on these models which is a cable security loop to prevent the unit from accidentally getting unplugged from power that sums up our overview of the balance 30 pro if you have any

{"id": "1VxdKCfcfEk", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "UAUkEO3N5acuwaYqeop5K2UrM2s", "transcript": "welcome to mobile must have my name's andy and in today's video we're going to be reviewing the pep wave balance 20x now in this video we're going to go over what the balance 20 is pros and cons a quick review of it so that way if you have purchased this unit you will see how to set it up and link it to any antennas or anything else i will put chapter markers below in the timeline here um so feel free to kind of click around and find the right spot for you based on what you're looking for all right well let's get this thing unboxed and we'll get started [Music] all right and here is the balance 20x unit it is a really good size it's actually not that much bigger than a transit i think it's quite a bit lighter um you can see the size on my hand it's it's um it's not that much bigger and it does have a couple of really cool interesting features the first is just the unit itself will have will come with a cat 4 modem it comes with a 2x2 memo setup built-in wi-fi and if i turn it over on the back it has a switch kind of thing so you can put in multiple ethernet cables directly with this unit compared to the transit that typically only has one lan port for inbound connections and then one lan port for outbound so you can only have one kind of hardwire in this gives you four lan ports and one lan port so that's kind of nice it does also have gps so if you did want to track it on some unit like that for a boat or something that you could do that too it's a really great option now actually the thing i think we most find intriguing about this unit is on the back again you can swap in a additional modem so it comes with a cat fort that's built into it and that has really good 3g bands but it's going to be pretty slow overall but with the expandable modem you can swap in a unit similar to this one and you can put in three different choices so you can put in a cat6 modem a cat 12 modem or the new cat 18 modem depending on which one you get the antenna options on this modem may change um this for example is the cat6 and the cat 12 will look almost identical the cat 18 has four it's a 4x4 memo modem so you'll have four antennas here we really actually prefer probably the cat 12 modem just for the sake of you only need a 2x2 antenna to support that so that makes it a lot easier it's very stable the cat 18s are great you just have to keep in mind that additional those four and four antenna ports are required so it changes the way you can connect that and the last final thing i think that's worth pointing out with this unit is that it has usb tethering so you can take your phone you can plug it in and you can use this tethering port basically you can use it with a phone or a hotspot but you can connect another inbound wan source through the usb now overall i don't think this is the best way to go for performance there's you know you can't necessarily boost the antenna off of your phone um at best you could use a booster if you needed to increase the service but it is a nice backup option if for some reason you are running limited data plans or whatever reason and you need a backup option um having this usb tethering is a nice feature to have okay so what the balance 20 comes with out of the box is it's gonna have the unit itself it's gonna come with these four antennas two are gonna be for your cellular and two are gonna be for wi-fi and then it comes with a gps antenna and of course an ac power unit now quick thing on the antennas and then i'm going to talk about power so this does only come with these four antennas and this works great if you're just going to use the balance 20 itself it comes with everything you need for just that unit if you are going to use an expandable modem on top of that these do not come with extra antennas they don't come with the with the kind of the stock antennas um i think that's actually okay you can do two things you can either choose to not use the cap4 at all which is what a lot of people are doing and then just use these additional antennas in the modem that you've selected um again you'll have two for the cats six and twelve you'll need two more if you're going to do the cat 18 and those are all listed in the product description if you want to buy more or you can buy two more of these so you would have you'd have four cell antennas and two wi-fi antennas built on here your other option is to go with either a roof mount antenna something like a seven in one would work since you're going to have four uh four cell two wi-fi and one gps uh or you could go um you could go with multiple antennas if this is going into your house a really great option would be an x-pole antenna that's a directional 2x2 memo so that antenna would plug just into your your expandable modem here and fit really nicely now if we talk about power like i said this is going to come with an ac power adapter so it's going to go right into the wall and then it's going to have your kind of your dc power cable here so technically this is converting ac into dc in this black box and then it's sending dc to the power cable to this unit now an option here if you wanted to convert this to a 12 volt system completely is to add on to your cart a our 10 foot dc power cable with this particular adapter now i'm going to link all of that below so if you wanted to add that to your cart you can do this power cable with this adapter that adapter will fit right into the pep wave itself and you can run this completely off of dc power so that is an alternative option if you want to go that route okay so now we're going to do a quick setup video for this particular modem i'm going to actually set up both the cat4 and the cat 6 expandable modem option but if you're going to do this with a cat 12 our candy team the steps will be pretty similar the only time this might change is depending on the antenna you're going to go with so let's get that started now we're going to start the setup process of the balance 20. the setup process is fairly similar to any of the other units and any of the other setup videos on our channel if you've watched them there are a couple of different things around this unit that i just wanted to review first thing i like doing is setting up the sim cards i like doing that it's easier without all the antennas attached so i'm going to turn the unit over i'm going to twist off this bottom piece all right and then now these work a little differently as they are set up to be like little doors so you have to pull open um that piece like even if you turn it upside down they'll open up and they're just like a little flap and it'll even tell you which way the card needs to go when you close it um there's a little picture it's pretty small but it's going to be right kind of in that middle of the black bar and it shows you the direction of the sim card with that sim card tag see the tag is on the top there so in my case it needs to go just like this on slot a and slot b is lined up identical so they both will kind of go this position it's pretty easy to get them in you just you flip this open you're actually going to put the sim card in the little door so the sim card will slide right into the door um you don't even really need to have the door open all the way uh it will grab onto the sim so if it's a little hard to push in it's just because it's holding traction down and then you're gonna slide that you're gonna push that down and then the silver bar will move and the silver bar locks it into place and that way now when i turn it over see nothing comes out so just make sure that's nice and solid nothing is hard to push nothing will require a lot of force so if it does you probably have it in wrong and then you can check your direction to make sure that same direction is in the right place um so and here's an up close of just what that sim card looks like in place so you can see which way the notch is going and stuff okay so now i'm gonna put my sim cover back on we'll screw that back in place and now uh we're gonna put in the expandable modem with another sim card the expandable modem is almost just like the br1 or the transit line you have a small little sim i think they call them dust covers technically that will pop out and then you can put your sim in here now i'm choosing to use more of a backup sim in the actual pep wave unit the balance 20 itself and my primary sim is going to go into this expandable modem and that's because this modem is actually faster this is that cat6 modem versus that cat 4 in them in here so i'm going to put my unlimited 18t plan um in here now it tells you in the picture which way to sim will go so you just kind of line it up with the picture like this and then you're going to put it in that slot the metal part the chip part of the sim always faces the other slot so if it's in a it goes down b it goes up um yeah and also you will feel it click in place it never goes all the way in it shouldn't quite be flush it should stick out a little bit and that way when you push on it again it will kind of push back it'll spring load back out sometimes i have found that they are kind of pre-sprung in so that first time you put the card in it might not push in but then you'll kind of get a good feel of that okay and now we're going to actually just put this expandable modem right inside the balance 20. it's got four little screws all right and then the metal cover plate will fall right out now we're going to take the modem we're going to make sure it's faced the right way the little chip part on the modem will actually go down everything will be facing upright so it should be pretty easy and then that slides right in place and we can screw all of the screws back in okay so now we have that expandable modem put in we have the two wifi on the side the two additional cell the one gps and then on the front are the first two additional cell antennas there at this point you could at this point it depends all on the antenna you're gonna go with if you're going to go with the original ones that are these little paddle ones you can start putting those on or if you're going to do something more like a roof mount this is the nemo five in one you could do that too one thing i really like about the mobile mark antennas for this particular use case is each antenna is completely separate each antenna cable um so you don't have to worry about how far it stretches over the modem you can very easily run each line to the right spot the pointing ones will struggle a bit here because they have a main wire chase or cover that goes over all the wires and then you only have about nine inches or six inches or so at the end and that's not going to be enough to go to each of these it's not a big deal you can easily cut that to get it to be longer but the mobile mark might have one step up here just because all the antennas are separate now at this point you just find the label of the antenna so this one is a 2.4 uh five point gigahertz um it also has wi-fi on the top so that would help you would just know that you're gonna go plug this right into the wi-fi port so you can go and do that now for this video i'm actually just going to use the stock antennas um it's just going to be easier for the video sake but that would be how you put on no matter what antenna you've got you've got that if you're going to go with these stock antennas they are also labeled for example right at the top here this says 2.45 gigahertz wi-fi so we know that goes into the wi-fi port all right we have all of our antennas connected now one quick note here it is important to connect every antenna uh the only one that you can leave out is your gps antenna it won't necessarily work properly if you don't have all the antennas connected we're going to plug in power to the unit and let it boot up okay on boot of the unit you'll see the switch kind of in the back dance with its lights and on the front you'll see the status light cellular light and wi-fi light i know these cards are active because they've been in my transit and i've had them for a while but if you don't see those get activated it could be an issue with your sim card and the next step is actually going to be us going to a computer so i'm going to move to that step and we'll show you how that works now it did take about two minutes but i got a green status light and then a green cell light which means everything is connected now i'm going to connect to the default wi-fi that the pep wave gives off i'll go over how to change it but we're going to connect to the default one first and that will get us into the unit and make any configuration changes we want from there most of the information you need is actually on the bottom of the pep wave that will give you the default login and all that stuff but on the computer if you go up to the wi-fi and now i see the new pep wave ace3 now yours will say a different code there but it's basically going to be pep wave underscore and then the last four of your serial number so i'm going to click there the password is going to be the last eight digits of your mac address but it's also listed under the ap password on the bottom of the unit all right we've hit go we're just gonna let that run for just a second now that we're connected to the wi-fi we're going to log into the actual unit in through the admin console the ip address of the unit you're going to type into the top once connected to the wi-fi is 192 dot again this is on the sticker in the back now it's not a private connection that's okay it's our own private network so you can hit show details if you're in safari chrome is a little different but it'll be the same thing um if you understood you can visit the website yes i want to visit the website oh my gosh right and once you get there you're going to be presented with a screen like this the default username and password is admin so a-d-m-i-n-a-d-m-i-n and hit enter now when you first log in it does force you to change this admin password um so we're going to type in our current password which is admin and then you can make this something you can remember later um so i'll just type in i do encourage this is not the best security practice but i do encourage you write that down maybe on a sticky note on top of the unit this will be needed every time you want to access this page you could also use a password manager like i have on my computer if you want to remember it that way but this password is important and the only way to save this password or recover it is to completely reset the unit so this is when you want to keep and this will bring you to the dashboard of the unit now a couple of things we're going to go over here the first is basically an overall status so up at the top you can see the current status of your cellular and you see the current status of the modem as you plug things in that will update and change the wan will tell you if there's anything connected that would be an inbound ethernet connection say this is home and you have like a dsl modem that you're using as well as this cellular backup that would show like a green bar there then you can see we have cellular 2 this will be the primary cat 4 modem when it's built in is on standby and then my primary which is the cell the expandable cell modem we put in that one is connected to lte that is working exactly as we expect it to and really at that point that's all you need to do this unit is designed to be stationary so it's going to be different than the transit lines where you can drag and drop connections every time you go somewhere so that is why we typically don't recommend this for mobile use but at the same time it is a good alternative now the main thing you might want to do is go in and actually change your wi-fi password to do that that is all done in the ap tab if you navigate over to there you will see the current ssid uh which just is the wi-fi network and we typically suggest creating a new one and then deleting the original one so you would go in and you'd create new ssid so we can say mobile must have network you can say always on i wouldn't change any of these other settings except for the fact we want to make sure that our password we can create a password you can go and do research if you want something different than this existing one but i let's just select the first one personal and i can put in my password again my password manager is is selecting one for me um but we're just going to go in and we'll type in our own and then we can leave it like that now for the most part you probably don't need any other settings changes we don't typically recommend any and i would just go in and hit save at this point so now that that new one is connected here you'll see it show up we need to hit apply changes at the top or nothing will actually be submitted it's designed that way so you can make a ton of changes all at once and then submit them all that way if the unit has to reboot or repower depending on the change you would see that so now we see the new network is there if i go up to my my wi-fi on my computer i should see that come over in a minute once my computer researches for those networks there you go and so now that my computer has researched its networks you can see that new network we just created i can go in and delete the old one move over to the new one and i'm all set i hope you guys found this video helpful for the pep wave balance 20x as usual if you have any questions feel free to leave them in the comments below but we are actually and usually a little bit faster if you can get to us on chat off of our website at mobilemusthave.com or send us an email at info mobilemusthave.com if you have any questions thank you so much for

all of the choices on our online store and you've been all over the net looking for just a way for you know good reliable internet in your rv or boat this video is for you stay tuned and we'll show you what all the options are [Music] so the number one comment we get on our blog and on our store when it comes to mobile internet is we've done a ton of research and we're honestly more confused than ever what do i buy so with mobile must have we've actually done a lot of the legwork for you by putting together our mobile internet bundles and today we're going to be talking about the various options that are available starting from the most economical bundle solution and moving our way up to our most advanced bundle now before we go through each of the bundles i want to talk through some basic terminology so that when i start discussing the features of each of the bundles they make sense if you want to skip forward from this part that's fine look below and there'll be chapter links for each of the bundles if you're interested in learning what specific features are in each unit but if you have time to watch the whole video i strongly recommend it especially if you're new to mobile internet the first basic i want to go over with you guys is wireless internet technology because it comes in a lot of flavors most people have heard of cellular wireless technology and a lot of people in their homes if you have like a cable modem and the cable company provided you with a with a cable box that has wi-fi or mesh wi-fi all these things that's a totally different type of internet wireless technology that does exist so i want to talk to you guys about some of the differences and some of the terminology for each that can be very confusing because they sound very similar first let's talk about cellular now in its most basic cellular technology for this video we're just going to keep it simple it's broadcasting from a cell tower right so that's what we're going to refer to as cellular technology there's quite a few different technologies that cellulars developed over the years you may have heard of 2g if you're older like me then there was 3g then there was 4g and now the companies are starting to talk about 5g well the g to keep this video quick and simple really just stands for generation it's the next generation of that cellular wireless technology and they're figuring out how to provide more bandwidth through that wireless spectrum either by getting access to more spectrums or through newer cooler technology for the purpose of this video and for all of our current mobile internet solutions as of 2020 we're going to be talking about 4g lte and lte advanced technology if you're concerned or worried about 5g honestly we do have some videos that you can watch on that but it's really developed and designed right now for urban environments where you're looking at feet from the cell tower not miles so i wouldn't be too concerned about that a kind of top the line 4g lte advanced modem can support quite a fast speed 900 plus megabits is what the modem itself is capable of doing so 5g while it sounds really good and it's going to be awesome for you know nascar events probably in six months where we've got hundreds of thousands of people all in a small stadium it's not really going to hit the rv industry probably until most of these technologies or your trip is already over with if you really care about 5g we do have some modems that you can message us about that have removable uh slots where you can put in a 5g modem but again i'm going to be honest with you you're going to be spending a lot of money on a technology that's just not ready yet so i recommend you just stick with what we're going to talk about in the video now 4g doesn't necessarily always come all in the same flavor there's original 4g there's 4g lte i'm not going to kind of overwhelm you with all that stuff but it's important for you to focus on the modem that you use to connect to the 4g network right now there's kind of four common modems that we see on the market and they're designated by what's called categories or cat so you might hear terminology like a cat 6 modem which means a category 6 modem or a cat 18 modem so i'll tell you briefly the difference of those and we'll go into it a little bit more in each of the bundles a cat 4 modem which is very common in some of the consumer grade internet products that we don't sell some of the older wi-fi ranger products the togo product the wine guard connect product those those use category 4 modems now those do not support what's called lte advanced and the primary difference is that they can only have one connection to the cell tower at a given time and they only support four or so bands with the cell tower bands are like frequencies or channels so you know a category four modem might support four channels and it can only use one channel at a time now with all these categories 6 12 18 we'll kind of get to the basics of what the differences are a category 6 modem has a max theoretical throughput or kind of max download speed of around 300 megabits per second which is very fast uh you won't see that typically in the us or anywhere because the cell towers don't necessarily have that much bandwidth to give you but the modem is capable of it a category 12 modem next step up has a max throughput of 600 600 650 megabits somewhere right around there theoretically double the speed of a category six it allows you to connect to more channels with the tower simultaneously than the category six or definitely the category four that doesn't support any multi-channel connectivity the third option is category 18. typically category 18 modems have four cellular antenna jacks on the back of them and those have a max theoretical throughput of i believe 950 megabits so quite a bit of bandwidth and speed again the vast majority of cellular towers are not going to provide you with that much bandwidth but a category 18 modem typically will perform faster downloading and uploading than a category 6 modem whether you're looking at a category 6 12 or 18 all of them are going to do what most people care about the ability to watch netflix the ability to do a zoom call the ability to you know have multiple connections and tvs or amazon alex is connected all at one time the ability to use the internet with two three maybe even four or five people in the rv it can do all of that the real limiting factor is not your modem it's going to be the cell tower and your data plan and what that sell provider is giving you in that particular area of the country from an average perspective we tend to see the national average be somewhere between 10 and 30 megabits um from a bandwidth perspective and like a full hd stream from netflix will use four or five so you're going to be okay with whatever modem that you choose cat 6 12 or 18 however the 12 and the 18 might be a little bit faster so you might be thinking i absolutely need to go for a category 18 modem then it's the fastest and it's only a few hundred dollars more not necessarily uh category 18 modems tend to have the most problems uh they require the most reboots and they are a bit more finicky than your average cat 6 or cat 12 modem which we find are much more stable it's just newer technology it's transmitting a lot more data and information and things can go wrong so oftentimes they need a little bit more attention that doesn't mean that they're not for everyone lots of folks want the fastest possible and don't mind an occasional reboot here or there but plan accordingly based on what's important to you okay so we've got the basics of cellular discussed and kind of figured out now let's talk about kind of wi-fi campground wi-fi personal wi-fi in the rv and how that's different from cellular okay so cellular is transmitting from that cell tower that's kind of where you're getting your main internet source if you're using cellular as your internet wi-fi is transmitting from the mobile router wi-fi comes in two basic normal flavors uh 2.4 gigahertz and 5.8 gigahertz most people call that 2g or 5g which is why it's so confusing because the cellular remember 2g it's the old cellular technology now we've got 2g wi-fi they sound the same they're not the same they're very different so instead of calling it 2g we're going to call it 2 gigahertz that will make it a little bit easier two gigahertz wi-fi that would transmit from one of these uh modems that we'll talk about in all of our bundles is what we kind of call long-range wi-fi it has the longest distance that it can travel lower frequencies travel further five gigahertz 5.8 gigahertz most people just call it five gigahertz um it's faster it's about four to five times faster so if your two gigahertz is going to operate at around say 20 or 30 megabits per connection again plenty for netflix plenty for everything per kind of connected device your 5g is going to be north of 100 120 megabits it's still all 100 dependent on how fast your cellular connection is but when we talk about these bundles and i say you have two gigahertz and five gigahertz wi-fi that's the difference so 2.4 gigahertz wi-fi or 2 gigahertz wi-fi interchangeable kind of terminology just depends on what is easier for you to remember is going to be longer range but not as fast the 5 gigahertz or 5.8 gigahertz is going to be shorter range but much faster so why would you even need five gigahertz wi-fi in a setup what's a good question five gigahertz wi-fi um is very useful if you have multiple computers in your rv and you're doing file transfers in between those computers or if you're in a really crowded or busy rv park where the 2.4 gigahertz wi-fi is just so crowded that there's a lot of interference it can be nice to have five gigahertz wi-fi it's also uh tends to be good if you have a ton of devices so you can have some of your devices running on the 2.4 and some running on the 5 gigahertz all the bundles we'll discuss today will either support the 2.4 gigahertz long range slower but totally fine for netflix browsing internet everything or they'll support both so we'll talk through kind of which ones are which in the coming bundle discussions another term you're going to hear us throwing around when we discuss these modems is something called wi-fi as wan so many terms i'm really sorry but trust me this is one of the last ones and it's important wi-fi is wan is a feature that some of these more advanced routers have which allows you to pick up public wi-fi whether it's walmart starbucks campground wi-fi an airport a casino they tend to broadcast wi-fi and a lot of them broadcasted outside these advanced modems that support wi-fi as wan that's the technology will allow you to take that public wi-fi and bring it in to your rv or your boat as if it's a internet source just like cellular so wi-fi is when it's not the same as cellular it means that you can use a public wi-fi access point as your internet source now remember the wi-fi has got to be good meaning it's got to have enough bandwidth it can't have too many people on it and wi-fi is wayne is usually considered a backup for most of our customers um but it's a nice feature to have especially if you like to travel in areas where the cellular coverage is not very good all right so you made it through the educational part of this video hopefully that wasn't too bad now all of our bundles are going to have a couple components you're going to get your cellular router or modem that's your central hub of connectivity that's where you're going to insert your sim cards and that's kind of the brain of the operation you're going to have a roof antenna that's an externally mounted antenna that can improve your access to campground wi-fi or wi-fi is when one of the terms we talked about or cellular because these antennas have i don't want to call it boost but they have something called additional gain that will improve your connectivity both to wi-fi or to cellular uh networks you're also going to get a dc power cable um which will allow you to connect up your power here not just to the included ac and you can these come with ac adapters so you can plug them right into the wall but it'll also include a dc fuse power adapter in case you want to wire it straight up to 12 volt battery these bundles do not come with sim cards sim cards are provided free of charge if you sign up for one of our internet reseller plans uh or you can purchase sims on our store i believe they're 9.99 for free with free shipping or you can just hop over to att verizon sprint t-mobile depending on who your carrier is cricket whoever as long as it's a hotspot plan and they'll be able to provide you with a sim card all right let's talk bundles our first bundle it's our entry-level bundle it's called the essentials bundle in the essentials bundle you're going to get a roof antenna that we'll show you in a minute a cellular router uh the model that you're going to get in the essentials bundle is right here it's called the max br1 mini you get this modem you get a gps antenna two small cellular antennas these uh are in addition to the roof antenna and a wi-fi antenna as well as an ac power adapter and a dc power cord which i don't have here but there's a picture of it and a quick start guide looking at this modem for a minute just giving you a high level overview we've got a removable here dc power input for our 12 volt input now these modems do accept up to 30 volts i believe in case you have a 24 volt system you can run it on your 24 24 volt system your bare wires from your dc fused power wire would go into here and then you can screw them down from the top over here you've got your standard barrel connector which you'd use with your kind of traditional ac power you do not need to power the roof antennas which we'll show you in a minute and you do not need any of these antennas if you're going to be hooking up the roof antenna but it does come with them so if you're looking to get started you can screw on these standard antennas which still do give you a little bit of gain much better than a hotspot these are two decibel gain antennas two decibels of gain is almost equal to a hundred percent more cellular signal so two decibels is a lot and if you look at a cell phone or something there's no antenna so two decibels will significantly improve your signal may not show in the bars a lot but it's definitely gonna make a big difference it's one of the reasons why these are so popular roof antenna is going to do better than these but it means that you can travel with this if you want to pull it out of the rv take it to a hotel maybe you've got you know a lodge or something you want to use this in that doesn't have internet and you're not going to be by your rv grab and go you could pull this out leave that in the rv still screwed into your 12 volt and take along this plug and you're off to the races in addition you've got two lan ports here for connecting local devices and on this side this is where you can insert your sim cards this device and all pep wave devices have a minimum of two sim card slots meaning you can load up two different carriers you can load up in this device say verizon and sim slot a and a t and sim slot b there's a little dust cover on here but i'll link a video to how you insert the sim cards it's quite easy just make sure you always use like i said before full size sims we've had people stick in the little ones and they get lost and then we have to send the modems back for repair so sim slot and sim slot b do not get used at the same time if you load in uh a sim for let's say a t and slot a and verizon and slot b you'd have to go to the interface console so you just type in an address an ip address into your web browser brings up a nice easy web-based interface and you can select sim a or sim b and give it about 30 45 seconds it'll reboot on the other carrier very handy one of the reasons why our bundles even our essential bundle is super super popular because you can switch between carriers verizon at t now you do need two data plans you have to pay two monthlies but if your primary is at t like ours is and you find that there's no coverage in a particular area you can get a limited plan from like a verizon maybe it's only 15 gigs or something but it'll get you out of a pinch if your primary plan is uh is is not accessible in that area now before we go into the roof antenna i don't want to make this too complicated but just going over a feature this modem does not out of the box support that technology to pick up campground wi-fi the wi-fi as wan technology um it also does not support a wired internet connection meaning you can't plug like a cable modem into this out of the box don't worry it is something that you can upgrade so you're not going to buy something and find out you need it and have to return the hardware but there is a fee for that for 99 later they will they will unlock the device there's a license you can purchase and that will give you the ability to pick up campground wi-fi or wi-fi as wand technology with the same hardware and it will also unlock the wan port here so that if you have a cable modem or you want to use this at home or at a lodge or somewhere where you you you may have wired internet uh you can go ahead and turn on that feature it's not 99 dollars per feature 199 dollar thing unlocks all the features and it unlocks them forever it's not like an annual fee or anything like that um last that same 99 fee will also unlock the ability for the modem to do what's called auto failover meaning that you could set uh your sim card you know your cellular in what's called you know priority a meaning use my cellular all the time and then you could set up campground wi-fi in priority b and that would allow you to if the cellular ever went out fail over to the campground wi-fi or vice versa it also unlocks the ability to do something called load balancing so you can put both the campground wi-fi and the cellular both in priority one and what that means is it'll use the campground wi-fi and your cellular at the same time it does not mean it's going to combine them into one super fast internet pipe it means that it will load balance so some of your traffic will go out the wi-fi and some of your traffic will go out the cellular it is comes in pretty handy though if you have a lot of devices because you can kind of get access to more bandwidth doing that again all of that is something that you can upgrade to with that 99 license out of the box those three features that i discussed at the end will uh not be accessible but the cellular access uh in this device um works great for most people and that's all i really need all right so let's talk about the roof antenna that comes in the essentials bundle all right and some accessories down here this is the poynting memo 3 series antenna this is a roof mountable antenna it has a ton of mounting options you can have your wires come down off the roof straight down as in the configuration it's in right now or if you look here you'll see a little channel right here where the wires can come out the back you'll also see these six little ports here where you can actually add magnets to this antenna that will allow it to be a magnet mount with the wires going out the back down here you've got an adhesive attachment on the bottom of the antenna that will allow you to adhesive mount the unit if necessary now this antenna is a five in one antenna but the essential bundle comes with a two in one antenna um the major difference is that the essential bundle does not have wi-fi in the bundle on the roof you can buy the mini and the five in one antenna separately uh on our store if you want to kind of future proof your roof antenna by putting in a five and one in case you ever felt like you wanted to add that 99 wi-fi as wan technology i'd highly recommend you do that but if you're not planning on it and you're saying look i'm just going to use cellular the two-in-one that comes with the bundle is is plenty for you so you get two cellular antennas on the roof uh with a setup like this and we have a video on how to install this antenna uh if you're curious um and you're worried about roof leaks or anything that that that might be concerning to you now if you do want to take advantage of the gps feature in this unit what that essentially means is that you'll be able to access the cloud based website called in control 2 that peplink provides uh for one year it's kind of like lojack it's very private and secure they're they're a company that does a lot of business with government uh and municipalities so they've they've got their security down pat but you'd essentially be able to view where your rv is online at any given time if for instance it was ever lost or stolen or in my case i had a rv repair store you know damaged some stuff inside of the rv and i was able to go and look at the gps and see that they were driving way faster than the posted speed limit and report that to the managers and and have the repair covered uh by them without any questions so the gps function uh can be come in very handy now this is only a two in one antenna so it doesn't have gps on the roof but don't worry this included antenna does not have to be mounted outside typically if you mount it near this unit in a cabinet or kind of near a window the gps will pick up pretty well even though it is not outside the antenna also comes with all the accessories needed to route the cables out the back and it also comes with the screws needed for the magnet mount kit they do not come with the magnet kit so don't throw this bag out if you buy this kit you'll you'll regret that later because those screws are a little hard to come by now the essentials router and uh and kit is a 2.4 gigahertz wi-fi system so you're not getting access to the 5 gigahertz wi-fi um like you would in our our next bundle we're going to discuss but 2.4 gigahertz plenty fast for netflix plenty fast for zoom calls video conferencing all that stuff so this is a great solution for most folks all right so we're going to move on to our full timer bundle next give me a second i'll put all this stuff away okay welcome to the full timer bundle a lot has not changed because there are some very similar functions and features full timer bundle is stepping you up to this which is the mk2 series uh modem by peplink it's technically it's called the max br1 mk2 still a metal housing quite a bit heavier quite a bit of heft on this modem this unit is going to step you up to a slightly faster processor a little bit more memory uh and a few additional features some of the basics you'll see are pretty common you've got your two cellular ports this is a category 6 modem just like what the essentials bundle is you got your gps port your two sim card slots here down below on this side you've got your dc power port you'll notice this one's a little bit bigger still removable although that screw has been tightened up so i can't pull it out right now still removable and it's got four ports instead of two the other two are for honestly machine to machine communication or serial port access if you want to put this on a combine unit and turn on lights on a tractor you can do that i don't think it's going to matter for most folks you've got your standard kind of dc power port over here and again your your two ports uh for uh for for lan this is labeled wan but it can also be re uh rebranded to a lan port inside the interface you can actually switch it no license upgrades in this device needed your wi-fi is wan your cellular auto failover your prioritization of your connections all are going to function right out of the box in the full timer bundle one thing you'll notice it's different is well i've got one extra antenna port there's two wi-fi ports on this one this unit will support the five gigahertz wi-fi that we discussed so you're gonna have the 2.4 gigahertz long-range wi-fi and the 5 gigahertz wi-fi they can broadcast at the same time in this unit so you can have a network for 2.4 and you can have a network for 5 and you can connect certain devices to each of them depending on what your needs are normally i recommend to folks they connect you know anything close desktops things that are close to the to the device to the five gigahertz it'll be a little bit quicker they don't need the range connect phones uh outdoor devices to the 2.4 gigahertz and they'll do a little bit uh better with the longer range uh but slightly slower wi-fi the wan port right out of the box functions so you can plug this into a cable modem and you know use a standard wired internet device and then fail over to the cellular or the wi-fi as wan and because you've got that 2.4 and 5 gigahertz wi-fi you can actually connect to two different campground wi-fi networks if the campground has 2.4 and 5 gigahertz wi-fi so technically you could have your cellular on you could have wi-fi connected to the campgrounds 2.4 network and then wi-fi connected to the five gigahertz wi-fi and you'd be bringing all of those sources in for your internet use so the full timer bundle uh is is quite uh quite popular and has a lot of features we typically recommend that this is for up to about 60 devices um you know the device could be a printer it could be a alexa it could be a smartphone could be a computer but this will support quite a few devices and it's designed to do so so this is a great unit in terms of what other options you get same thing you're getting your gps antenna you're getting your power adapter uh you're getting two slightly larger cellular antennas that come with this for a little bit more uh power and gain and you're getting this the two wi-fi antennas as well you'll also get access to the roof antenna and now that we have our five and one antenna out from the last video it'll all make sense so same roof antenna uh same multiple access or multiple installation options wires coming down out the back adhesive mount magnet mount option available in this antenna so it's a highly flexible antenna and five leads coming off of this antenna so you've got your two cellular your two wi-fi sorry two cellular two wi-fi and your gps all coming down from the roof and that will fill all of the ports here on the device with this five in one antenna you will be able to pick up campground wi-fi as mentioned before but if you have an airstream or another kind of metal enclosed rv it may actually be challenging if you're transmitting your wireless from outside your rv the benefit is your exterior wi-fi on your patio and whatnot will be significantly better but it may not transmit inside of the the coach as well as you'd like that's okay and this is actually a great kit if that is a challenge that you're facing what we recommend to customers is you hook up one of the wi-fi antenna ports here uh to the roof antenna and then you select you you take one of the small stubby antennas and you connect it to the other port that will give you a transmitter inside of the coach and on the roof so you kind of get the best of both worlds and they will work pretty well with one on the roof so you get outside access and the ability to pick up campground wi-fi and on the inside so all of your devices inside can connect to the internet as well so that's the full timer bundle let me take a moment to put this away and then we'll move on to talk about our speed demon bundle ah so we've been discussing all category 6 modems up until now and now we're going to talk about a category 18 modem so we're jumping all the way to the top in terms of what technology is out there and what speed you can access look how many antenna ports are on that bad boy slightly more complicated installation but not too bad so this is called the transit cat 18 prime care edition um now with this modem and with all the transits uh most of the features are pretty similar so i'm probably going to show you the same modem for for both the uh the speed demon and our ultimate road warrior and our standard road warrior bundles which we'll go into next so let's kind of go through the hardware summary and features we've got our dc power input as we did before uh this one's got a few more transmission and receive uh functionality ports for our machine to machine technology and communication not something that we think any of you guys are probably going to use these two usb ports on the front here are actually for batteries uh you can plug in um like those small battery packs that charge your cell phone using a standard micro usb cable into here plug in one of them and it'll actually power up this device making it very portable popular for live streamers backpackers folks that kind of want to be on the road news crews or anyone who kind of needs to get a lot of internet uh portable the reason why there's two ports is you can actually plug in a second battery and unplug the first battery so you can go charge it without the device going offline nice nice function vast majority of people won't use it but if you do have a van or something small where you want to have uninterrupted access you don't want to go through a bunch of trouble of getting to you know 12 volt power or maybe you have a travel trailer that doesn't have batteries in it that could be an interesting option for uh using the device when you don't have either 12 volt or shore power in the box you have your same complement of what you're used to in all of our bundles your gps antenna your power cord your dc power adapter uh but then you're gonna be getting four cellular antennas and two wi-fi antennas these small guys there's your wi-fi which is a longer one in your small cellular and those are going to be hooking up back here to this massive port connection plate here now the speed demon bundle with the cat 18 has two sim card slots this is a single modem device just like the previous units that we talked about so you can use sim a or sim b not both at the same time but you have a category 18 modem in this bundle so you've got that max theoretical throughput of 900 plus megabits per second so this thing can scream uh if you have a tower and a cellular provider that can support it these two and these two top connections are your cellular connections this supports what's called 4x4 memo or mimo and that will give you quite a few various connections to that cell tower all simultaneously carrier aggregation all sorts of the newest latest technology to really get you the top fastest speeds down here you've got your wi-fi connections this is a device that like the full timer bundle we're stepping into the unit that supports the 2.4 gigahertz and the 5 gigahertz or 5.8 gigahertz wi-fi at the same time and then we have our gps port again two sim card slots on this device and this also comes with mounting brackets so that you can mount it up uh in an area or against a wall and it does actually have an optional din rail installation which probably isn't applicable to rving but it is an option on our store now the speed demon bundle comes with our seven and one pointing antenna we still have the five and one here for uh example purposes but they're basically the same uh there's just two additional cables uh in the seven and one bundle so what you're getting with this antenna is four cellular antennas so you can connect up all four two wi-fi antennas that gets us up to six and then one gps which gets us up to seven with this antenna again with the speed demon bundle you're getting the optional magnet mount option the down spigot option uh the ability to wire the wires out the back if you want the adhesive mount that comes with this unit and we've got plenty of videos on how to install this if you're worried about drilling holes in your roof um this antenna um is a is a great option and the size of the five and one and the seven and one are exactly the same so this exterior footprint it's about nine inches by about five and a half inches if i recall is going to be the same regardless of of what bundle you get the other benefit that the category 18 modem has is it has access to band 71 and band 14. band 71 is that new t-mobile rural band that they're calling 5g this modem does have access to that and can support it um so that is a nice plus for the category 18. definitely something you want to consider if your t-mobile customers to go into this modem it also supports band 14 which is a t's rural band that is also called firstnet it's a first responder band that they built out for police ambulance and fire for rural band use but it also has the ability to be used by the public when first responders are not in need of it again though the speed demon cat 18 modem is one of what we would consider are kind of less reliable modems it's kind of like a car the faster they go you know sometimes the more they need to be in the shop that doesn't mean that they necessarily have a higher failure rate that's not what i mean but they can occasionally need to be rebooted uh in order to get optimal access to all the cell towers and uh it's a relatively new modem so new firmware updates are coming out on it every single day we've we've sold hundreds of these a lot of people are very happy with the unit but if you're like i just want it to work i never want to think about it and i'm not technical at all i'd probably look at the full timer bundle or possibly go into our road warrior bundle which we're going to talk about next all right home stretch only two bundles to go and it's getting a little dark out here so i'm actually going to combine these into talking about them in one sort of section so we've got our road warrior bundle and our ultimate road warrior bundle those are two bundles that we have on our store what are the differences now both of these bundles come with dual modem transits dual modem is different than dual sim when i showed you the modems before that had multiple sim card slots it was either access to sim a or sim b and they couldn't be used at the same time when we get into our road warrior and ultimate road warrior bundle we have four sim card slots and we have two modems in the device so we can use two sims at the same time no you do not need two sim cards if you want to look at purchasing one of these bundles you can load up one single sim and they will operate perfectly fine without anything in the second modem but the second modem will give you access to some pretty cool features now the hardware or the external aspect of the uh road warrior and the ultimate road wear is virtually identical to the speed demon device so i'm going to show you the same device but i'll highlight what the differences are even though they're virtually identical i don't i have one with me right now it's currently my internet and my rv and i don't feel like pulling it out because i have to upload this video for you guys but trust me it's all the same the front is identical there's no no difference you've got your dc power input here you've got your your lan port your wan port which can also be reassigned as another lan port your dc power input and your usb power inputs here to power the device the back again virtually identical you've got two cellular antennas here and two cellular antennas here the difference is that these are for modem one and these two are for modem two so we can run and operate two modems at the same time we still have our gps we still have our two wi-fi's the road warrior and the ultimate road warrior both support 2.4 gigahertz wi-fi the long-range wi-fi and 5 gigahertz wi-fi are shorter distance but faster wi-fi pretty much the only hardware difference with this modem is that behind here now you have four sim card slots you've got one two here for modem a and one two here for modem b or you could call it the other way around modem one a and b modem two a and b you get the idea now these two modems can operate at the same time what that means is if you put a let's call it an att and a verizon sim in at the same time and you load them up in your dashboard both up to priority one it will use both modems at the same time it will not combine them that term called bonding that everybody thinks this modem can do it can do it has all the software and technology to do it in our bundle but i'll get into why you need a little bit of extra stuff to get that working so it won't work out of the box what it will do out of the box is it will load balance these two modems so some of your internet traffic will go out of sim a and some of your internet traffic will go out of sim b um if you've got two att sims in here you'd have to pay for two data plans but in theory you would have double the bandwidth it would be like having two um hotspots running at the same time and the modem is smart enough to know okay this one's being used by one computer i'm going to use this other modem for the other computer so they both have a faster experience that load balancing technology is built into both the road warrior and the ultimate road warrior so what's the difference between the road warrior and the ultimate road warrior the difference is the category of modem the road warrior package has two category six modems the same modems that were in our full timer bundle great modem super fast 300 megabits max throughput a per modem and it's an absolutely great device that is priced incredibly well in that in that bundle package the ultimate road warrior steps up to a category 12 modem that category 12 modem also supports something called firstnet if you are on a t which gives you access to their rural band that they use for first responders but that also let the public use when first responders aren't using it that can help out quite a bit if you're on the a t network the ultimate road warriors category 12 modem does have theoretically twice the throughput of the category 6 in the road warrior bundle so you're getting that 600 megabits throughput um so the ultimate road warrior is definitely a good you know modem to look at and consider now both the road warrior and the ultimate road warrior modems have a technology built in them called speed fusion that allows you to bond those two modems together into a single uh what pep wave calls unbreakable connection what that means is if one modem goes offline if you're in the middle of a video conference the conference will not break and you'll continue to be connected that doesn't always mean okay i have 10 megs on this sim and i have 50 megs on this sim i'm going to connect them and i'm going to get 60 megs i wish that were true but bonding requires quite a bit of bandwidth to actually connect the two sims together so manage your expectations when it comes to speed fusion in order to use the speed fusion technology you have to host the speedfusion server up in the cloud that means you've got to have a working knowledge of how to spin up a server in the cloud and it can get a little complicated peplink does and just has released something um called their speedfusion cloud so they will host it all for you and turn it on with just a few clicks of the button but there are gigabit limitations to that um and it can you know run you for you know it could probably run you 100 bucks a month um to to pay for their cloud hosting server uh stay tuned or message us we also have a beta programmer running where we're hosting speed fusion servers for customers um so we can talk about that with you offline we'll do a separate video on our own private speed fusion cloud which is an option but the point is with this device you're getting all of the licensing to uh gain access to the ability to do the the what's called sd-wan or or wan bonding of multiple connections at the same time now the speed fusion technology uh with the ultimate road warrior and the road warrior um doesn't just stop with your cellular connections you can actually take the wi-fi as wan and your wired internet and you can bring them all together into one like single connection so you could have campground wi-fi at 2.4 gigahertz campground wi-fi 5 gigahertz cellular modem a cellular modem b and a cable modem and have them all connected into one single fat or fast pipe uh with the licensing that's included uh with those two devices so the the roadway and the ultimate road wire are are some of the most advanced mobile connectivity solutions that are currently available on the market today so that does it i'm getting kind of eaten by bugs so i want to wrap up this video but before we stop i do want to talk to you about one additional thing with our bundles which is that you might have noticed that in some of our bundles they say you know ultimate road warrior and it's got this antenna and you'll see others where they say ultimate road warrior mobile mark edition a mobile mark antenna and this antenna are are very similar in terms of their performance uh they you know you can read up on the specs but they're going to have very very similar performance the mobile mark does cost a little bit more and it actually has fewer uh installation options than this antenna so the vast majority of people will go with the cheaper option which makes sense but to talk about the mobile mark there are a couple key benefits to it one it's smaller it's only a six and a half inch or so wide antenna and it's quite a bit shorter it does really well with sprinter vans or anything else where a metal roof is already in play and if you don't have a metal roof you can get a grounding plate that they sell as part of the kit they also make a pole mount for the mobile mark antenna so there are quite a few different mounting options with that kit the reason why it's more expensive honestly it's made in the usa which is great if you want to support that and mobilemark i think has a much more established name and reputation in the antenna industry so they charge a little bit more for it and i think those antennas are worth it my bus has a mobile mark antenna on it that said that if you're looking at something where you're going to have a magnet mount option or you want to run the wires out the back and maybe enter into a box or do something else custom with your installation the pointing antenna is going to be a better choice in most situations that's really just personal preference and that's whatever your installation um is best for all right guys that sort of sums it up those are our internet bundles as of mid 2020 so thanks so much for watching as always our staff is available on our store mobilemusthave.com you can start up a chat there and ask any questions you have thank you so much for watching you know through this video and kind of educating yourself on everything we do before you engage our staff on on questions and stuff that helps us get to more folks

{"id": "sMx8g2nVSk0", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "_V-b0-qTFNasrkuJOu4pJHyIXJ8", "transcript": "welcome back to another video my name is andy here at mobile must have and today i wanted to walk you through adding a verizon card to your pep wave so let's get started so we are staying just outside of bar harbor maine and it is stunningly gorgeous we are about 15 miles from acadia and it's definitely something you need to add to your list if you haven't made it here already now since we're here we have had pretty good at t coverage um all the way through and that is what we're mainly using for our data plan uh we're using the one that you can get at mobile must have now i wanted to add a backup data plan here so when i say backup it's not a primary unlimited plan this is going to be a 15 gigabytes i've gotten somewhere where i have no coverage and i with att and i need to add just something that kind of can carry me over until we get back into an att coverage place honestly this has happened to me one time while on the road so this is not something um i feel like we need to do a lot of and have a true unlimited verizon plan for 18 has gotten us really well covered but there are some times where verizon is just going to be better suited and i want to have 15 gigs available to me when that happens now i'm recording this video as of august 2020 and i say that because currently verizon is offering for 20 bucks if you add it to your existing line um a 15 gigabyte card now once you go over 15 gigabytes it throttles you to 128 kilobytes it's horrible like it's unusable once you're past it 15 gigs it's not the networked managed plan that they had before but 15 gigs is good enough to get me through a weekend or through a couple days if for some reason there's something wrong with atm t like the towers down or i have no coverage or something like that so this is a backup plan for me so the first step you need to do is obviously actually get a verizon sim card um for me it was easiest just to run to the local verizon store in town and have them add that hot spot plan to my account and when they did that they gave me a sim now the guy there actually was trying to give me a micro sim and that's going to be a small one one more for a phone or a jet pack um and i had to make sure that he got me the full size sim card this is the standard size or something like that but it's the full size one and this will just punch out from this card second thing once you have the sim card you have to have the imei of your device um so to get the imei there's two options one is on the box that your pep wave came in there's a white sticker and it will be located on that white sticker it will say imei and that will be the number for your modem now if you did a transit duo again that has two modems in it you're gonna have to pick which modem you give them in most cases as long as you give them a pep wave modem imei it should work in any pip wave so even if you feel like you need to switch modems you're not sure give them one of them and it should work fine in the other the second option is to log into the admin console of the pep wave and when you're there you can see the cellular option at the top and in this case when you click on details and you go to the fifth line down you can find that particular modems imei so that will also get you the same information you need that way too now that we have our sim card the sim card has been attached to our account and the account has our imei on it we should be ready to put the card in the device so let's go do that next okay now in most cases you do not have to uh to unplug this or unscrew any of this i did this really just to show you guys what we're gonna do here now i have the transit duo but the process is going to be the same if you went with a pep wave br1 mini all the way up um it's going to be more or less the same the only difference you're going to see is mine on this side let me try to get the camera focus so mine has you can see two rows of sims so i can put two in this modem and two in the next modem uh most of yours if you don't have a transit duo is just going to have two sim slots total now in most cases your primary one is going to be in slot at your primary sim card you can see you can see that here i've got two already so i've got one sim card for each modem already and primary in the a slots so i'm going to take this new sim card this one and put it in the second slot the b slot uh make sure when you punch these out of course you don't break anything cool um now okay so here we go so we've got the sim and let's see and we've got there we go we've got the two slots now uh we've already gone over this if you have more questions about sims i'm going to link a sim video up above but basically the metal part with the tag the little part that's the tag is going to go inside and the metal part goes up so we're gonna go into cell modem two i'm gonna put this in the second one so i'm gonna go into the second modem this is modem one trying to focus this is modem one this is modem two and then i've already got one in slot a this is going to go into slot b it's going to go with the middle part up and the tag going in and you'll hear a click you hear the click there you go so now we have three we've got one primary slot a and then in my second modem i've got my really my plan b and now my plan c for coverage now we have everything really connected the way we want to we're going to plug all the antennas back up and we're gonna put power back in should be pretty simple now that we have all of our hardware our sim card and our pep wave everything's powered back up everything is connected we're gonna go to the admin console of the pep wave and this is where we can verify the card is working the one that we put in and uh or see if it's not and this is actually the first time i'm doing this so no we'll be troubleshooting together okay so now we've already logged in to the admin console um and you can see this is the dashboard now i am going to have a couple of things that a lot of you may or may not have so don't freak out if this is a little different each type of device does have a bit different of a dashboard and that's okay now we have to remember where we put that new sim um our primary sim is up here and you can see that's connected uh we have ltea on 18t and that's great um you're gonna see i'm also attempting to connect to wi-fi as when and it's jumping all over the place it's connects it scans and then it disconnects and i've had the same issue with my five gigahertz network and it's just you know what it's probably not even worth having on so we'll just turn that off now my cell 2 i i have a another card here that is unlimited and you can see based on where i'm at it's running 3g and roaming and just has although it has bars it's it's just not going to work for us here you can see the cpu on the bottom it's thinking really hard it's working on making all of those changes um over and you can even see i am doing this in real time we just restarted our router eight minutes ago you saw that in the clip beforehand so i'm trying to do this with you guys in in real time so there's nothing behind the scenes we're doing here we'll let this connect hopefully it's gonna show us pretty good service uh with our with a verizon line and we'll see now my phone on verizon right now is getting two bars where we're at maybe three if i'm outside um so i'm curious to see with the pointing antenna up on the roof um connected to verizon we'll see if it's any better okay so it's resetting this is all good signs [Music] okay great so we're obtaining an ip address you can see we're connected to lte it was on lte a there for a second that's a pretty good sign now obtaining ip address for the first time we're connecting might take a minute oh you can see it went to standby and we're connected awesome so that worked out perfectly for us now if you get stuck on obtaining ip address that means one of two things one is there's something wrong with your billing and you're probably gonna have to contact verizon and say my device is seeing that i have my sim card so it's on a device issue is something wrong with billing the second is it could be your imei it wasn't punched in correctly you didn't connect it up front so you're gonna have to go back to verizon that's what obtaining ip address means there's something wrong with the billing aspect of that now just for kicks and giggles let's do a speed test first we're going to do a t since that is what is connected and we'll just pull up the speed test app let it find its server all right and i'm going to change it to something more local we're just going to do [Music] we'll do the banger one we'll make sure that's the same on both let's hit connect wow so atmt is smashingly fast here um and this is a great connection right off of and again this is just the mobile must-have at t plan uh that you can get off the site and um yeah and then the the transit duo so that's a cat 12 modem now let's switch it so we're going to turn on cell 2 we'll turn down cell 1 let that all reconfigure here we'll do this in magic and now let's do our speed test again so i'm actually going to close speed test and i'm going to reopen it and that will just kind of reset everything for it we'll watch it go to a verizon provider and then we'll make sure we're using the same server and we could go there so verizon is still a super solid connection obviously it doesn't quite compete with 18 t speeds here but 30 down and 22 up that is more than enough for what we need to do our work so i'm very happy with this as a backup plan so far now i'm going to do one other thing to this cell i'm going to bring my 18t plan back up so i'm not taking up too many gigs on my verizon plan i'm going to go into details here and since this is a limited card i'm going to go i'm going to go down to the let's see what section is it on [Music] okay i'm going to go down to the cellular settings i'm going to say um both sims because that's really what i want to do and then i'm going to prefer sim a because that's really the sim that's an unlimited sim so i want to keep that one up sim b is my backup and then i'm going to go in and i'm going to enable um allowance bandwidth allowance monitoring and then i'm going to go down to here i'm going to type in 15 and you've got to go in and figure out when your monthly bill resets um for this particular plan um i honestly don't know what mine is so i'm going to figure that out i'm going to put on the 10th for right now and then we can hit save and apply so that will allow that card to activate when um for some reason sim a and that modem doesn't connect um which it's not connecting now remember we had a wan error so that means it was having some issue where it couldn't connect at all and we were on 3g roaming um so obviously the pep wave is going to pick the verizon card over that that other card here and boom we are uh we are live with that card all right guys as usual if you have any questions leave them in the comments below we are normally faster though if you would like to email us directly at support at mobilemustave.com if you'd like a response there too all right guys and until the next video we hope to see you on the road see you later okay so i wanted to do like a little extra clip here for anybody who is paying attention i do have the speed fusion enabled so what i'm curious about is speed fusion is being created here see it says creating tunnels you saw the speeds of both connections on att and verizon super solid right i'm turning on my wi-fi just to see if it will connect it's hopeful but um the speed fusion looks only at stuff in priority one and i wanted to do a speed test with stuff just in priority one to see what is it when they're merged together now we know speed the speed fusion does not double the traffic right so i had 50 before and 30 it is not going to create 80. it's not create it's not doubling my speed limit what it's doing is it's creating another lane so everything is still going at the speed it was but i now have double the bandwidth to put stuff through sometimes i can change speed test a lot of times it won't but since they were both a little different i wanted to just see what it would do now you can see my source is now amazon since i'm using a amazon vpn for the speed tunnel and let's hit go i'm expecting it to be around 30 to 40. i don't know see the ping test was a bit higher and all right so it's pulling mostly probably from att it's even better than it was before so you see we are getting some speed gain uh we're at 70. wow so it did actually do quite a bit of improvement there and then the upload is still very solid too so i bet you that'll settle around 20. yeah that's pretty close that looks really really nice and of course now we've duplicate packets across multiple things and we've done a lot of uh there's a lot of background happening there to create that really solid speed test and we can do one more if we go to fast.com which is quickly becoming a speed test i'm enjoying this is going to be focusing more on streaming so it's not too much focused on the ping because it's going to be for netflix right so that's all one-way traffic for the most part um and the speeds are usually very different speed tests are kind of crazy all right so we do more info that we can see what our latency is so lane seems a little bit lower than what speedtest.net was showing and we'll see what the upload speeds get yeah see the upload speeds are super high compared so super hard to tell but either way you can tell this is a very solid connection uh with speed fusion we're not really dropping any speed we're probably gaining anything and having those two solid lines together so the next video will be how fast do i go through these 15 gigs all right guys see you next time [Music] you", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-08-31T00:05:47Z", "channelId": "UCE9KnGK2TcpXLlIi5cQfGvg", "title": "Adding a

{"id": "YwbcBgsGWLM", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "zqu_lATKc6B-x1HnCPbjvWwg_HU", "transcript": "hi guys my name is Andy and on today's video we're going to talk about how to install a pointing MIMO antenna on your RV alright so let's get this started so like I said I am installing a pointing MIMO antenna we're putting it actually on my personal RV it is a Keystone Fuzion and I've been waiting for the weather to clear up to kind of get this video out and I'll put this together for you so super excited about finally getting mine installed now I am installing the pointing seven and one so it has for cellular to Wi-Fi and one GPS antenna all inside this box now it doesn't matter the orientation of this I don't have to point it anywhere since it is a thin I'm going to align it more or less perfectly with my RV in the direction but overall orientation of this does not matter for the most part now to get started the first things we're going to do is cover a couple basics this is probably more of a part to to my pep wave installation video so I've already done that I'm going to point out here and I'll put it down below and that was actually again in my RVs installing our transit duo pep wave in the RV all about this and I mentioned this up front is this is about location where you're gonna put this antenna matters where you put the peple a it can matter there's a couple of things you have to take into account the first thing is where can you get power right so the pep wave needs DC power preferably but it also runs off of AC power if you want to plug it in the second thing is where can you run this antenna right so this antenna has about a seven foot cord that comes with it 6 foot cord you need to be able to run that from the roof down to whatever the pep wave is and then third when this is up on the roof is it going to run into anything is it going to be in the way of anything else all of that kind of matters we also want to make sure this is 18 to 24 inches away from any other antenna or AC unit so if you're going to have it in the middle of your RV where there is an AC unit nearby just make sure you've got a team to 24 inches if you don't there can be interference problems especially if it's actually see unit you'll have interference on the pointing but if you have a next to another antenna they can just mess with each other then you get any benefit from it one key important to note I'm going to also insert at this point is the optional grounding plate option this is not required and you won't even see it in my video I did not do this on my particular installation but we haven't but it is and can be recommended depending on your install so an option is to take a grounding plate it could be a 12 by 12 aluminium plate galvanized steel plate and use that on your RV you can adhere that directly to the RV roof if you want to use a magnet mount if it's the steel option or just adhere this then directly to like the aluminum plate and that will ground the antenna and that actually does make a big difference that will add one to three decibels which is a pretty big amount to your antenna service you can do that it's an option it is recommended but it's not required so when you're mounting your pep wave if you're going to do one of these roof mount in tennis you know look ahead and do that now if you have a mobile market antenna we're going to do a video kind of reviewing the differences between the pointing and the mobile mark in this particular case if you're doing a standard roof mount antenna install it'll be pretty much the same they both have adhesives on the bottom they both have the antenna cables coming out the bottom they'll be very very similar so if you're free to follow along if you're going to do that couple things with the pointing though that makes it a little unique if necessary this is a couple different mounting options I'm gonna go with probably the most standard in my RV which is drill a hole and put the antenna right on top of that hole that I felt was the easiest for me one because I didn't have anything nearby to potentially snake this through and use so you have to drill a new hole I had to put a hole in regardless and then second I thought that was going to be the most watertight solution we'll get more into that when we actually get to that part of the process but was why I went with this again the mobile mark is going to be a very similar installation to a couple of different options you have for mountainous so like I said we're going to do there's kind of standard one you have a couple different connectors for links inside the roof if you need to protect your cables you can play with those to figure out which one works for you the most this one I actually have set up to do kind of a flat mount you can see the antenna comes out the back and is totally flush and give a light right there you go and it has the magnetic mounts on this one so this is if you're going to mount it to the top of like an Airstream or at the top of a truck or a car and you need it to work you can stick it right on the bottom this comes out completely flush and actually interesting a picture here of another installation from a customer and they have this flush at the back and they're using their antenna to go through their solar their solar channel for their cables so that way they didn't have to put another hole in their roof they could use an existing kind of cable run for their antenna now while you're planning all of this and we are going through this some of you might find this cable is a bit short for what you're trying to do this cable is actually the the kind of optimal length we want to keep them at but longer the cable goes the less actual decibel strength increase you get from these particular antennas so we've kind of kept it at that six foot you can get an extension if you really need one but every time you extend one of these cables out you do lose decibels in that extension so just keep that in mind if you need the extension really make sure you need it and you can't put it somewhere else now let's get started with the installation the first thing we did is I actually found the right location so I've already put my pep wave I've already installed that I've looked on the roof right above there's nothing gonna be in the way that's causing an issue there so I actually take my drill and I drill up from the ceiling and then I take a screwdriver and I just kind of put a hole or a little dent in my roof and from there I knew where to drill the hole in from the roof in my case I just have this kind of small Angus inch and a quarter drill bit there's a couple of different options you can get find the tool you're comfortable with and you can drill a hole right through in my case my holes were a little bit off so I fit an Ethernet cable through and then with the end of the ethernet cable I taped these tips to that and then pulled them through quick note it's very important when you're taping these up make sure you don't rip off these little tags these labels like we have no way of knowing what cable is what if these labels come off so if you need to use a scotch tape around them and then the duct tape to pull through just make sure you don't rip them off because you won't be able to find out which one is what later so it's kind of the other important note there from that I just kind of quickly and gently pulled that through so I have now all of my cable basically inside my RV and and we're pulling it all the way through the cabinet and then through to where the PIP wave is being housed once I have the cables through I'm actually gonna go back up on the roof and securely mount the Poynting antenna the cables inside they are where I need them to be I don't need to do any further work on that I want to make sure that I get everything done on the roof on the roof now that I'm ready to actually secure the the Poynting antenna to it is I clean the surface find a good material mineral spirits is typically recommended in this case but it does depend on the roof material so find out what might be a good option for you and just do a thorough cleaning you really want the adhesive to be sticky and you don't want any water to get through so I clean off the surface I make sure my antenna is all lined up nice and straight again it really doesn't matter which way that it's going but it is a fin mount so I don't want wind to get against it or anything so I line it up nice and straight on on my roof and then I taped it down now I did not use the magnet mounts so you did see me take the sticky pads and push those into where the magnet mounts could be if that was an option you were going with and then peel the stickers off of each of those and then push it in place and I held it down for about 20 seconds I think and then released it and from that part you're pretty much good to go there's not real much else you need to do on the roof after I did the rest of the inside work you can come back and do this is I put a bead of dicor around the antenna I thought that was important to just over do the water sealant part of this the manufacturer does not say that is required or even necessary but I thought that was just really important to make sure that this is gonna be as watertight as possible and dicor in most cases is your best bet now quick note if you're actually going to do this flush kind of back mount option I'm going to throw a couple pictures up here this is from another installation we did this is a Class A with solar and they already had a junction box with a hole going inside their RV they didn't want to drill a whole nother hole in their roof just for the pointing antenna so they did a flush back mount exit off the pointing antenna and then ran their cables through that junction box there another great solution if you don't want to put another hole in your roof now everything is done on the roof we're all set we're all sealed up and we're all ready to go up there final step is to come inside and connect all the cables to the pep wave quick note quick note don't fast forward this wait they are going to be these adapters inside with the thing with a little baggie that comes with the box this comes with it everything inside comes with it it's not an option it comes with it inside that bag is going to be this little adapter this adapter is needed and required for the Wi-Fi portion so these cables here find the ones that are for Wi-Fi in this particular case they say 2 point 4 or 5 gigahertz MIMO that's that's the that's the Wi-Fi one you'll notice these cables the ones that come on the Poynting and the ones and the pep wave are all male so you can't it won't work you're gonna have to this is this adapter is female on both sides so when you screw this in on this side it will allow it to connect correctly to the peplum side without this you're gonna be like why is the Wi-Fi not working I can't get any services because you don't have any Wi-Fi antennas plugged in unless you're using the adapters so I just want to say important note don't forget these little adapters okay so really at this point connect all the cables I have seven cables I'm connecting I'm connecting for cellular to Wi-Fi and one GPS if you are going to if you got the full time package that's going to be a five and one that's going to be to cellular to Wi-Fi one GPS you can connect those up again they're all labeled because we didn't rip the labels off with the tape or anything so they're pretty quick and easy to install if you're doing the full time package you'll find that you have to kind of split these up and I go on either side you can watch our video are we showing you how to connect those if you do it slowly and do it carefully they do fit it's a tight fit but they will fit on the 7-1 everything's on the same side so it's a lot easier okay that's it once you're all connected you can login to your admin console at the pet wave you should instantly be able to see the increase in service and and speeds from my particular location I went from like three bars AT&T service two full bars LTE a which means I had multiple towers I was now able to use for service so we've had a great experience so far with installing us if you have any questions please leave them in the video below you can also email us at support at mobile must-have calm and we'll get back to you as soon as we can we have a lot of other videos about pep waves and antennas

right so we all have that time where we first hear about a device we don't really know what it is we don't know what it does but we're curious so I'm trying to explain how I view what a pep wave is and and give you kind of the core features of one we'll start a kind of sum of what all pep wave times generically and then I'll give you our top three options what we sell on mobile must-have but again there are more options than that so at its core a pet wave is a networking device they call them an LTE router and its core function is that it can bring in a cell network like 18 T or Verizon data plan you can put it into the SIM slots and it will create a Wi-Fi that you can use like you normally would in your house right from the device it's very easy and it takes almost no setup to kind of get that get that working so it has a cellular kind of modem in it it has a Wi-Fi capability so you connect your laptop to it or your phone to it and it also has GPS so think of like the old kind of LoJack kind of thing where you could see where your vehicle was if this has power and you've connected a GPS antenna to it you can see basically where well at least where the pep wave is located some good use cases for the pep wave would be really any kind of nomadic person so that would be more like myself an RV or a boater is typically a really good fit for this we even have a lot of truckers that are doing cross-country and they're just never really plugged in and they would like some Wi-Fi this is really good for that use case another good use case for this is rural homes someplace where they might not have wired internet to run to their particular location if you have cell service you could run one of these and get full basically home blown Wi-Fi like you'd expect there's another really cool feature I like about the pep wave called Wi-Fi as well and basically if you're going somewhere that has public Wi-Fi available you can connect that Wi-Fi to the pet wave and then the pep late can use that as your main source of Internet your main kind of inbound source you could turn off or use it in tandem to your cell connection but now you have kind of more capability and more bandwidth to use through a free Wi-Fi source if you're familiar with a Wi-Fi Ranger or other products like that that would be similar in capability but I think in a much more smaller kind of joint pack with how the pep wave solves that problem and the last feature that anything is important to mention is its power you can power this through a DC connection say directly to an auto battery or RV battery or you can run it directly into AC power it has both options on the bottom it's a really good option if you'd boondock a lot and you would like to have Wi-Fi available I'm just running off of the house batteries of the RV the Bo batteries it's very flexible you don't need inverters to use this device now let's go through kind of our three top options for pep wave there is the pep wave mini that is going to be about a $400 $400 option it has all those major features we talked about in this unit except for the Wi-Fi as well that is available to purchase as an add-on this particular unit is called the mk2 and I would say is a great kind of middle all-around good option it has all the major features you can connect to two SIM cards with it it has both 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi it has GPS it's got all the major things built into it this is a really solid choice if you want to go over the top like I did you can go with the transit duo and it's gonna be a little bit bigger than this one not by much and you have to sell modems and it with the Wi-Fi so you can run simultaneously two SIM cards you have four total slots and then you can run Wi-Fi on top of that it's a true beast of a machine but it's great if you really need a solid connection you can't afford to have any kind of drops in connection you have four sims to kind of cover all that usage it's um it's definitely a solid choice now one of the great things we do like and mobile must-have about these pep waves is you can use a pointing antenna which basically is a roof mount antenna that you can connect to all three of these with we have an antenna kind of match to each one and if you would like better service or you need kind of better connection overall that's a really cheap inexpensive way to really get a lot more out of the pep wave and the service you have available all right guys I hope you got kind of some of the basics about what a pep wave is check out the rest of the videos on our channel we show you how to set one up we show you how to troubleshoot how to connect to Wi-Fi all different kinds of things all about pep waves on this particular channels to go check it out I'll link them below up above at the end of the video all the places alright thank you for hanging out with us today and we'll see you next time bye [Music]", "snippet":

Wi-Fi as when and actually what is that alright so this video is pretty simple and actually it's much harder to explain I think then actually the concept is so stick with me for but Wi-Fi is Wham it's basically just using a let's say a campground Wi-Fi a Starbucks Wi-Fi some external source of Wi-Fi as my main Internet source to my pep boys so the way I think about it is the pep wave is really good at bringing in different strings of usable internet it's you can use your SIM card you can use Wi-Fi you could use a lamb kind of plug in if you wanted all of these sources can bring internet accessibility basically to the pep wave and I connect all of my computers my iPads my phone's all of that I connect to my pep wave using this Wi-Fi as when I'm connecting to my campground Wi-Fi I'm doing one in at one connection to that Wi-Fi one time I'm putting in the password one time I'm selecting that network I'm doing that using the pep wave and then once the pep wave is connected the pep wave is giving that Internet basically to all my devices that are already connected so instead of me connecting my computer to the campground Wi-Fi then my phone then anything else it needs to be connected all I've done is I've said hey pep wave go get internet from this source and then share it to everything else so let's now jump to the computer I'm going to show you how to turn on Wi-Fi as when and then configure it to a particular network so you can join it all right now we're on our computer and I've already logged in to the pep wave console admin console you can see already I'm connected currently to my cellular one which is a 18 t line and I'm getting LTE speed so it's actually working pretty good for me right now but for this example let's show you how to connect to a Wi-Fi network so at the bottom you'll see I have a couple different options I see Wi-Fi LAN 2.4 and then I see a 5 typically I would I have found that campgrounds mostly only offer 2 point four it actually goes a little further than five once a while you've got a good campground that has five but I recommend trying to point four first the workflows the same we're gonna let it scan it's gonna find some networks you can once it's ready you can click wireless networks and here you're gonna see a list of all networks that are near button that you have range to you can see I've got this campground Wi-Fi which is the one will connect to I've got a guest network that's really bad signal another guest network it's also really really bad and then this is probably another RV with the Weingard solution so we're going to connect you the the campground Wi-Fi we're gonna put in our password and we're gonna hit save we're gonna then hit connect your hit okay and now we're gonna connect okay and there you go we can see it's slowly connecting we just lost the signal it'll come back I'm actually going to turn on the five gigahertz connection while this is thinking and we'll see if this network has a five gigahertz what I like about five gigahertz is it actually is a faster connection but it doesn't have anywhere close to the range of 2.4 so that's why most campgrounds would just do a 2.4 and a gigahertz connection but if you can get one it shows five like look this one's got five and it's really close we'll hit connect type in the password and see if it goes well wait for it to get a green star and then I'll hit connect yeah and so I do connect to the five five feet hurts when I can sometimes I have found even with a much less thing like let's say you get a two bar signal on five gigahertz I don't get way faster speed than full bars on two kind of something you have to play around with when you get somewhere new yes we want to connect there we go so almost instantly obtaining IP interest and boom we're connected to the campground Wi-Fi so I'm not sure what's going on with the 2.4 but that is what you expected to see with the five gigahertz now the way online just explained the last two would be if you're gonna run like an Ethernet cable for your house or from maybe your camp I luckily has maybe like a wired connection with all of your other hookups you could run an Ethernet you would connect it into your wham port your wide area network port on your Wi-Fi on your pep wave you would do that you could do that you could see that inbound connection there the cellular to is really only gonna be on the transit duo that will run two separate kind of cell modems and I can have both of them running at the same time so if I drag this up here that one would run at the same time I think that one's on a verizon network if it if it connects one I'm currently located well that's kind of it so that's how you connect to Campground Wi-Fi with your pep wave if you have any questions leave them down below I'll also leave an email to support if for some reason something's not working quite right and we will we'll see you the next video thank you [Music]",

{"id": "PutMmBIHa00", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "6diS4ZJ3Y1JxMu5EQEUP-BbjNUk", "transcript": "welcome to mobile must-have my name's Andy and in today's video we are going to be installing a pep wave transit duo in my RV now as I said in the intro we are installing this unit today on my RV and you can see we're in a fifth wheel right now in this video we are going to be doing a step by step kind of instruction on how to install it we are also going to be planning my particular installation to use a seven in one mimmo this one here this this antenna today we are just going to focus and use the antennas that come in the pep wave so if you're not installing a 7-month that's fine you will see how to get out of the box to fully installed in just a few minutes now in the Box you will see it comes with a couple different sets of antennas and a power cord so we have two sets of cellular antennas as the duo does have two cellular modems that can kind of run at the same time and then we have a set of Wi-Fi antennas it does come with a GPS antenna and I will say a friend this is the only one that it's optional to install if you're doing a71 this kind of comes and it's really easy to do but if you're not going to do one of those seven and one or five and one antennas you actually you wouldn't need this but it is it is kind of fun to be able to see your rig in the system so first thing we're gonna do is we are going to take everything out of the box like I have and we're going to do our SIM card installation first I find that easiest before we put all of the kind of the ears and antennas and stuff on it alright so let's get with the SIM cards so first up of the SIM cards is to remove the dust cover again on this one it's going to have two screws yours if you're using like a br one max or a mini which I've also used those are just can have one screw the important thing about the SIM cards is to make sure you insert them the right way and the duo there's actually four independent slots on most you'll only have two if you bought a SIM card for mobile must-have as well as your do you're gonna have to pop it out of the the card itself and so you can see this one I've already popped out this is a Verizon card this is an AT&T card the thing that's important is when you put it in to make sure it's the right way and also make sure you're using a full size card if you're not using a full size card Mobile must have has adapter kits on our website again link below is for that you need to make sure it's in this standard format or the ff2 format now the actual connector card itself for the SIM card itself will go in the first the top slot will go facedown and the bottom slot will go face-up to make sure it's inserted all the way I just kind of pushed in you will hear it click I don't know if that's audible on the camera or not but and then if you want to pull it out you can push it in again and it'll kind of come back out it's not like a little I got a spring so we will kind of push that in now if I wanted to put in a second one I could do it in two different places I could put in a kind of a backup sam onto the same modem for this so if they're gonna failover if I wanted to or I could just put on a whole second modem I could always be running so I can do that again so I'll just push this in and then there you go now again if you want to get out and push again and they come back out sometimes I have found that when I'm putting this SIM card in first it's already compressed in so if you don't so don't over push it it's just uh you know just with one thing or you can kind of push it and get it pushed in very important stuff all right once we have that all done we can cover up the dust cover and we are ready for the next step all right so now that we have the SIM card done the next step is going to be to put on the antennas now on the duo there are lots of different antennas and this is definitely the one with the most so at the same time it's pretty easy everything is labeled up at the top you're going to see a cellular one and so you're to each of those have two antennas and in the bottom are for the Wi-Fi the one in the middle on the top is for GPS if you're going to do a seven and one each of these will have its own kind of cable which we'll get to again in another video so this step I'm going to insert the antennas now each antenna at the very bottom does have the what it is so I just picked up the 22.4 or the 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi so we know that it's the same now where it goes for the Wi-Fi it doesn't matter both of the antennas are the same it's just that the Wi-Fi antennas will only go on the Wi-Fi spots and the sunny ones will only go on the Sager spot so don't force him if it just if it's not going double check that you've got the right the right one and that will that will make it easier it is very important that you install all of the antennas each antenna well although you might not be using a certain part or don't think you need a certain part it's designed to have all the antennas there so make sure you're installing it with with all the antennas for its own purpose if you don't you can have interference problems you can have reception problems erroneously kind of hard to troubleshoot so even if you don't think you're using it it is it is important that all antennas get installed the only one I'm comfortable saying I think you can skip is going to be the GPS one that one is not required for actual bandwidth or anything like that now in some cases you can try to wrangle these if you want with so many antennas it can I'm not gonna lie be a little tricky it also depends on your setup for now I think I'm just going to keep all of them straight up and I might tilt these just because that's kind of fun but it doesn't really matter I I've been having these straight for a while it's fun now we're going to move on to power there are two power options for all pep wave units the first is a standard AC power that would be something you plug in into a wall socket when you aren't sure power and this is what I've been using in my mini for probably 18 months or so and we haven't really had any problems other than if we're boondocking or we're running off of batteries we have to run an inverter or something it's just not very efficient for today's particular installation we're going to run a DC power cable we're going to hijack some DC power off of some Able's then using the DC cable accessory from mobile must-have we will use that to connect directly to the duo let's start that installation so the plan for our install is to mount our pep wave unit behind the TV now in most cases I think literally right behind the TV is where you'll put yours and that's where mine is sitting now in a temporary spot our TV is actually on a full folding kind of cabinet space so I want to put it in the cabinet behind there mainly due to the fact that will allow me to put my seven and one antenna when I have that ready it'll be a much easier install for that I'm going to try and be stealing power from my stereo as you can see in kind right there if that doesn't work there is a bathroom on the other side of that wall where we might tap into the the power going to the fan I'm not quite sure yet we'll figure out the best way to get power all right so that's the location now let's get to work [Music] so at this point what I'm looking for is a 12-volt power line that I can splice into my first choice was to look at this bundle of wires I didn't feel confident I could take a good power wire and ground they weren't clearly labeled so by pulling back this black box I found a pass-through into my basement storage and in there I know on the other side you will see basically our main command center of wires soomi very standard for a keystone that is labeled so I could find an ox 12-volt power and a 12-volt clowned coming right out of this main unit and then I could just connect my main cables to those to those labeled wires this seemed to work fairly well for me for this phase I do recommend removing diffuse that comes installed with the optional DC power kit that way if any wires cross or anything and you didn't unplug the battery you won't blow that fuse right away it kind of simplifies the install once everything is plugged into the pep wave and you have power set up back to the battery if you've unplugged that you can insert the fuse and you won't have any issues [Music] now that the power wire is installed I know how far it will reach so I can get the correct placement of my pep wave I have to pick this place specifically because I am going to be installing my seven in one pointing antenna basically right above this point so for right now I'm going to keep the stock antennas installed so I'll make sure there's enough room for them here but that is going to be worthy antennas coming down from they also recommend mounting it before plugging it in to simplifies things if you're using the DC power option that whole port will basically come out you can pull it out that I found that easier to install the screws and make sure everything was tight on the kind of that mount itself and then install the mount once the the pep wavers was correctly screwed in and the wires rinsed all of them out it just seemed to be easiest for them alright and there you go now what you're gonna look for is a red status light on the bottom as soon as you connect the power that that light will turn on that light will turn green in a few minutes once it has kind of booted up you will also look for a Wi-Fi and sell your light those will turn green when they're on when the cell your light is green that means it is has found a cell tower and it's getting connected and that will bring us to our next step of just showing you how to connect to the Wi-Fi that the pep wave is giving off now that we have everything set up with the pep wave physically in the hardware let's go in and get you connected to the Wi-Fi I'm going to be using a laptop today but you can do this on your phone or tablet as long as you have a browser and you can connect to the Wi-Fi from the pep wave you should be able to do the next step without any problem all right so let's go to the computer so first thing we're gonna do is go up to the Wi-Fi and we are going to look for pep wave and then a couple numbers to know the right numbers you're going to look at the serial number of your unit that can be found on the back if you haven't mounted it yet however if you still have the box you can look at the back or the product thing on the box and that will tell you your soil number as well so in our case it is pep wave four eight seven nine I'm going to click on that is going to pop up a password the password is going to be the last eight digits of your LAN MAC address that is on the back of the pep wave it'll say AP password again if you did Matt like we already Mountain I didn't take a picture it's gonna be on your box too so have no fear so in our case it is dating for four three one two zero all right and to confirm you have a good connection you can see up at the top we have pep wave our number and then it's checked off saying we're connected to that particular Network now I'm going to show you how to get into the admin console there might be a couple things you want to change that you want to change the password or change the the Wi-Fi name you can do that here if you if this is a little over your head already we offer a service where we can help set this up for you and we'll leave an email address in the description below so you can you can check that out and we are happy to help you here at mobile must handle alright so to get that man cause you're gonna type in 192.168.1 you can see I've been there before we enter the password by default is going to be admin and the password by default is also going to be admin I hit enter and I'm gonna be logged in so from here we can see I put in my AT&T card I'm getting three bars of ete a that means I have multiple towers connecting to my to my unit that's great that means I should have some pretty good speeds I have a way on address if I'm gonna actually you can hardwire internet into this solution if you're a stationary and you have those an option my second cell yer I could turn on by just bringing this up into my priorities and we can watch that connect if I want to use campground Wi-Fi I can do that too by pulling this one up with that one once you get activated or once it finds a network you can choose the network put in its password so on so here we go so I can put in like a wireless network so here so I have already connected to my RV see this is just the the network I'm at now I can connect to that and it'll show that it is on standby mi celular to that one if you see this message this might mean you're having an issue with your actual data card itself getting connected I have had this issue where I've had to call my carrier and give them like what device I'm using and sometimes sometimes that's just the blockers they're just not the networks aren't talking the right way if they are asking for any information hit details here and they're probably looking for the IMEI number that's that's well this is my number so this is per device but give them your IMEI number and that might resolve this obtaining IP address kind of standoff you might see a device in I would say the device is connect within within two minutes typically sometimes even faster if you see that for longer than five minutes there's definitely probably some billing issue make sure you paid your bill make sure it's connected correctly if you're just upgrading from another device again it might be a device ID issue all right so there you go so there's some of the kind of high-level basics again if you have questions reach out to us and support we offer a service or we can kind of better help set you up on this thank you so much for watching our video today on installation for the pep wave unit and we hope to see you in a video again

I could turn on as a priority - and I could wait for these to connect there now in this case you're seeing obtaining IP address that is typically a good sign that is means that it can see that there is signal I can see that there are service but it might mean if it is stuck on obtaining IP address that you don't there's something wrong with the billing so either Verizon or AT&T or whatever your network is might have turned off the plan it could also mean that your device isn't connected correctly to your SIM card sometimes those IDs need to match up if you're trying to do this in a new device and you're stuck up obtaining IP contact the service provider they might need to change what this called the SSID to get that linked up so you can check that you can also check signal strength so here we're seeing four bars of AT&T however I'm gonna pull up a speed test and even with four bars of AT&T it's just not a good signal like like it's if the signal is fine but there's no bandwidth coming at me from AT&T so what I'm trying to stream something on my TV or or load something on my tablet it's just not gonna work like this this should have already connected and it hasn't and it's just that the network might be overworked right now for my location um if that's the case I suggest looking at at different priorities so switch it to your cellular - or switch it to a camp on Wi-Fi that might produce a better speed you gotta kind of have to play with it every new location that does bring up a point of bars don't always mean better speed you can have two bars and have a great speed on your connection or like today you can have full bars and it's still trying to connect and still have really bad service so full signal strength does not necessarily mean good speed it just means you have a great connectivity to the tower but it doesn't mean that that tower is gonna have good service per se all right so in my case we can see 18 T still isn't really connecting I'm gonna actually connect to the campground Wi-Fi here so I'm gonna bring up our Wi-Fi Wham you can try it like in my case I have both the 2.4 kind of Hertz and the 5 gigahertz connections typically camp brands don't have a 5k a hard one will save some really nice speeds I've already connected to this campground so there's the the campground Wi-Fi name it's I've already put the password in if you need to connect to a new one you know you can click on get connect find the one you want when you get connected there's a password required like it will be you'll see on this one you can type the password in here and hit connect and it will get connected for you all right guys and that's a kind of a quick getting started troubleshooting if you can't get connected so again to review real quick check to make sure your hardware is plugged in check to make sure your network priorities are set up correctly if that's still not working check to make sure your bill is paid or everything is connected in the cloud correctly with IDs and accounts all that kind of stuff you might have to call it networks for that one and then I'd know that's working see if there's another way you can connect see if the campground has Wi-Fi you can use try a different SIM card if you've got a different network you're gonna have to kind of be flexible sometimes depending on where you are and sometimes there's better connections and others again if you do have any questions and this you didn't quite get what you needed out of the video there is going to be an email in the description and I'll put it right here of who to reach out to and we will do our best to respond if you have any questions alright guys thank you so much for joining us in this video we'll see you next time but [Music]", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2019-12-29T23:05:25Z", "channelId": "UCE9KnGK2TcpXLlIi5cQfGvg", "title": "Troubleshooting Connectivity with Pepwave", "description": "If you have any questions, email us at support@mobilemusthave.com.\n\nVisit our store!

{"id": "Br8fkdhrHpI", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "VXc5QDPFMw8LUQclWKHmRLV1hV4", "transcript": "welcome to mobile must-have my name is Andy and today we're going to be talking about installing the new TST TPMS system lots of initial there [Music] now for today's video I'm going to be using these flow through sensors they work very similar to the cap sensors on the install and the syncing between the screen and the sensor really the only difference is the flow through part of it or not now if you're more in the research phase of which TPMS system to go with the coaming kind of major factor difference is the flow through z' require a metal stem going into your tire and if you have a rubber stem or something that's not metal you can put the cap on it's important you put the right ones on your tires if you put the wrong one on it could rip off during driving conditions and and create a nasty experience there the overall time for this installation is I'd say roughly 15 minutes kind of doing all the syncing and installing it's really not that hard of a process but of course if you have 12 tires it's going to take you longer than the six and a couple things before we get started this particular TST unit is this kind of standard 507 this will connect with your truck and I believe up to four different trailers so you can have almost like a hundred different sensors connected to this so when you're going through it just make sure you're setting it up for trailer one or if there's nothing then that would also be trailer one but if you do want to buy more sensors say you have a boat and an RV or like a utility trailer you can buy one for each of these trailers and without doing any swapping or additional head units per se you can do that to get started it's pretty easy the first thing we're going to do is turn the unit on on the side and it should come powered if not you can use a standard kind of micro USD on the side to charge it we are going to set up our tires may you have a couple options that the instructions will walk you through you can use the stickers that come with the pack and name each of the sensors so I had just gone through and made them one through six you will see any instructions you might want to name it based on the end of the trailer and put one through six on your truck it really doesn't matter the purpose is just so you know which sensor is designated for which tire when you're doing this setup in actual installation so to keep things easy for me as I just did tires one through six and they're all going on my tri-axial fifth wheel all right now we're ready to go so the first thing I like to do is put my number stickers on each of the sensor so I can keep those straight and then now that I have all six of those numbered we're going to program we're going to program them into the system it's just a few button pushes but it's nothing too challenging hold down set and you'll hear beep and then we're going to move over to the learn ID I think it's up five times something like it then we're gonna hit set again now we're going to move to the tire that we want to program so I'm gonna actually do the inside of the last four or last six of the trailer there we go so now I'm gonna hit set and that will set the F's to start flashing now from here I'm going to hit program which gives me this kind of ID and I had it sitting right behind it so it already found it then I'm gonna hit set and that saves it in so now I'm going to do the same thing for number two so in case you missed it we're gonna do it a couple more times from this screen I hit plus to go to the next inside tire I'm going to place my sensor at the bottom of the screen I'm going to hit set for it to start flashing I'm gonna hit go or code sometimes what they call instructions it's going to find it I'm gonna hit set and that will basically save it in place I'm gonna go through these and do them all in order so my next tire is outside I'm gonna skip that one alright next tire is outside on the passenger side skip that one now I'm on that inside tire I'm gonna do three so I'm gonna set my sensor here I'm gonna hit set to get it flashing I'm gonna hit code to get it to program set again to get it to safe now we've done number three you know before five sixth and I'll meet you back here okay now that we have everything programmed we will see on the screen we will now be showing our six tires that we've got programmed in the position we program them and we should be set to go at that point there are a couple default settings you can change if you want to that would be below and high-pressure warnings as well as a high temperature warning I recommend going about 10 to 20 percent on the low pressure and high pressure typically for a blowout if you're concerned about tires are gonna happen on the low pressure setting so when you start losing tire pressure in your tire that's when you start to have a blowout the other chance would be closer to your high temperature when you go over let's say like 200 degrees and your tires is when you'll start having a problem the default temperature rating is 175 as you probably leave the high temperature default alone but depending on the range of your tires for the low pressure you might need to change that if you need to change it it's quite easy if you hit set and hold it you will see flashing on the bottom for high pressure if you go up you will see it change to low pressure up again is to set the high temperature this is where so if I was to change the high temperature navigate back to it hits it and you will see the tire selected it's probably gonna start for the tractor settings or your car settings if you hit the top button mine says go but I've also seen it's a code that will move the tires selected back and the temperature is set based on that stats height you'll see the default is set to 175 it's a bit high from my tires so I'm going to find a right grouping of tires which is that back roofing and then you can hold down the plus or the minus to change that number so I'm gonna change mine to let's say I'm at 80 I'm supposed to be at 80 so I'll put mine at probably 110 I want to be alerted at 110 if anything goes over that psi hit set again and that will save it and then we're gonna go check the low pressure yeah sent again to enter that we're gonna hit code to change it to the right tire group settings and our low pressure is set to 65 that's pretty good we're in the winter so the temperatures and the tires are changing a lot I typically will wake up and they're far below 80 but once we get to driving temperature they hovered around 85 psi so something around 65 psi I want to be alert once it hits that point we're gonna hit over to go to the high temperature setting again you can hit set and you can change the temperature from there there are a lot of other settings you can get out of your manual if you're interested but this is kind of a major setup you need to do and now at this point let's just go install them on our tires alright and now we're down here with our tires we are going to start installing them it's a pretty quick process but one thing to go over there is a safety feature you can add with these it comes with them it comes out of the box you'll see like this little just kind of funny wrench thing the concept is is you can screw on the little nut before you put on the sensor and then you can tighten the nut against the sensor and that work that doesn't allow anybody to just take off the sensor if you're in a parking lot or anything like that pretty easy install but just can be a little tricky with this if you want to do it alright and like I said you just take the nut we're going to spin it all the way down the thread then we are going to take the correctly numbered valve I'm going to screw it on [Music] look and make sure you make it tight but don't over-tighten it you over tighten it you can cause more problems than making it too tight and then I would with your hands take that nut and push it right up against the tyre sensor and once it's as tight as you can get it with your fingers and you can come in with a little wrench and give it just a bit of a tighten don't over tighten any of this it is it's like a hard plastic but so you can still break it and then I put my cover back on and you're all set to go and now I'm gonna go through and install on each tire the little bronze kind of hex that that came with it and then putting our sensors over it and just make sure to keep those numbers so you don't have to take them all off again put the back on or reprogram them if you can't remember so try and keep it in order all right let's go tire by tire okay and just like that I've already installed just this side and we can already see I'm getting a tire pressure back I'm getting the temperature of the air inside that tire and we're already seeing progress okay and just like that everything is set up we have all six of our sensors installed and we can almost instantly see on the screen as we click through each one that they are all there and reporting so that is working I would say and suspect - now it's colder than when I filled them up last so they're gonna show a bit lower than 80 psi but but it's okay you'll see they're all they're all pretty close now one more topic around this is for mounting it comes with two different options the first option is going to be this cool kind of like - thing you can just sit on your - it's it's silicone so it'll stick for the most part or it does have a sticky windshield kind of cup you can decide what you like I kind of prefer this one because I don't like it up all the time we don't we we drive in our truck so I don't like it sitting up on this when I don't need it and everything so I'll put it on here I get about four solid Drive days on the battery life out of this and so when I don't need it and we're not towing I will just put it in the center console of course turn it off but leave it in the center console and then when I need it again on a tow day or a travel day we'll just we'll set it back up from a charging standpoint I have plugged it directly into the USB of the truck it does come with a kind of a cigarette lighter adapter or you can always just kind of charge it when you're sitting if you've noticed it's dead it's very flexible so all in all I think this is a great system like I said I've had it installed for a couple months we haven't had any issues you can get additional sensors from mobile must-have if you need them you can add them directly to this you don't need a whole other system you can just get additionals we sell in packs of two and four with the flow through and the caps you can mix them if you need to like so for our truck I'll probably put cap sensors on it since that's the right type for the particular tire I've got but I'll leave the flow-through is on there you can even buy sensors for your spare tires if you want it there are spare tire symbols on there for each trailer and truck if you want one alright that's the video for today if you have any comments or questions you can leave them in the comments below or you can email us right at mol must-have and we'll do our best to respond you as soon as we

you all about it [Music] for those of you who don't know us we're Eric and Kayla and we've been full-time RVs for about five years now we're up here in Traverse City Michigan which is northern Michigan it's a place we absolutely love to RV and it also happens to be where we ship all of our products from in our online store we're at Travis Bay RV Resort which is absolutely beautiful if you've never been you definitely have to come and check it out and we're here during our favorite time of the year when the during the fall when the leaves are changing and it's not that busy but it's getting a little chilly out so let's go ahead and go inside and tell you a little bit more where you can hear us better so I know we've been a little niña with our blog lately but we're super excited to tell you what we've been up to yeah so about a year ago we had this idea at a soft launch an online store which we weren't really sure if that was gonna be possible or not to compete with the Amazons of the world but long story short we looked at Internet Solutions because of my background in technology and we started providing internet for RVs and the store kind of took off from there we launched the store pretty quietly we kind of wanted to work out the bugs and make sure we understood how the whole process worked and the orders and how to get payments and all that so we didn't even really tell anyone that we were running the store other than folks that came to us who needed a solution of some sort so fast forward a year and we have over a thousand satisfied customers at this point and we're processing about 200 orders a month so it's definitely grown yeah most of it was just being shipped out of our RV kayla was super happy about that we quickly realized that we needed to formalize things so Eric so Eric partnered with a technology warehouse and a distribution facility that we knew and could trust yeah so it was a company I'd worked with from my day job for a while I knew the guys really well and I knew that they would take care of our clients when it came to fulfilling our orders but more on that later I'm actually going to take you down there and tour you through the facility but before that we have some exciting news about kind of the future of our blog and in the future of the store so here's the big news we are splitting our online store and our blog into two separate names that way it'll be easier for folks to follow what they care about more and we're extremely excited to announce the official name of our online store Mobile must have calm yep so that's mobile must have dot-com we've tried to keep it as simple as possible if you're mobile and you must have something we're gonna try to sell it to you yeah but that allows us to really get back to living like net and focusing on our blog on kind of what you guys subscribe for in the first place which is you know the DIY projects that I work on and then following our travels and whatnot we've got so much to show you on the project side we did a massive solar install I think one of the biggest ones I've ever seen we have twenty four hundred watts of solar with twelve panels on the roof powered by a pretty massive Victor on overhaul of our entire electrical system I ripped everything out so we pulled out all of the Magnum stuff that came from Integra and put in all Victor owns stuff with custom touch screens and that's going to be a super fun video and it's done and it's tested and we're ready to show that to you guys we also have our dump automation video where we're able to dump our tanks with the press of a button Kayla absolutely loves that we really wanted to test that for six months minimum before we share it with you we've had zero bugs it's working great that's not something we're gonna sell you can buy the parts online that's really more of a DIY thing if you want it you know China route how to build it yourself it's a little custom but we'll show that to you as well and a bunch of other product projects we've done a water filtration video where we ripped out our whole water filtration system and we found a hidden place to put it in our Integra that was actually screwed shut we didn't even know was an empty compartment we fill it with water water-based office will show you that and lastly our fire safety rollout where we've put fire safety products in all the critical aspects of our RV from our generator to our engine bay to our inverters to where aqua hot it is to make sure that if there were a fire that we have a system that can react not just to tell us like a smoke alarm but actually to put the fire out before Eric takes you down to the warehouse and gives you some awesome coupon codes for the grand opening we want to give you a summary about what the online store is all about yes so at a high level from a product perspective most folks know us for our Harvie internet solutions we've been featured quite a bit with the with the folks at techno media and the RV mobile internet Resource Center they've they've definitely featured a lot of our products and have had things good things to say about us we also are now a dealer for TST which is a tire pressure monitoring system that specifically kind of geared towards the commercial trucking industry we've been super happy with the product for three plus years it's just been revamped because they were acquired by another company and we're excited to tell you about that pretty soon in future videos or obviously a weeaboo stealer for cellular boosters and most recently that the fire fight products for the fire safety we're super excited about if you're interested in learning anything about any of these products we're going to be doing deep dive videos on each of these products on the mobile must-have YouTube channel which I'll link to in the corner there thanks so much for letting us kind of tell you about that I know it's kind of a you know a self promoting video we're talking about a store where you buy stuff from us but we really appreciate you kind of giving us the time you kind of share what's going on so I've got some things to do here at the RV but Eric's gonna take you to the warehouse and show you around all right let's go all right so the warehouse is about 15 minutes away this day is amazing so I'm gonna take the motorcycle I won't be able to talk to you guys on the way but we'll be there in a second [Music] all right we made it so before I go inside and embarrass my colleagues with a camera in their face I wanted to tell you guys a few reasons why I selected this warehouse in Traverse City Michigan obviously the people up here are the key to why it's so awesome up here so that's a big reason but there are reasons separate from that that I want to go through its kind of four top reasons one I work with them in the past with my day job axiom technology group where they supplied us with computer hardware for some of our commercial clients and we were really happy with their service - it's an employee-owned company which means every single person that you deal with on a warranty return shipment anything is going to be someone who cares about the customer more than anything because it's their business it's a government-sponsored program I'm not exactly sure about the details but it's very legit I've talked to every single person here and they're super happy to be here the team's just about 35 people so it's not a lot of folks and they really care the third kind of big reason for me is that this is the largest distributor of Peplink products in the entire country which means that if it's coming from Asia where they manufacture this stuff into the US and then going to folks like us that sell it chances are it's coming out of this warehouse so to cut down on hassle and to improve the likelihood that we always have stuff in stock we partner with the warehouse that has all the stuff to begin with all right so enough of that I want to introduce you to a few of the team members both on the technical support side and on the pre-sales side as well as show you some of our inventory and stuff we've got going on and then we'll give you some cool coupon codes that will save you some money if you decide to place an order in the future [Music] [Music] all right so this is our team with their standup desks thank you fancy so this is John John's responsible for coming up with this mad scientist idea of us starting a an online store for our viewers so he's kind of our primary point of contact and makes sure that everything's in stock and that we have all the latest and greatest products and the way that we've got everything set up here is these pods or kind of triangle desks here are representative not just of people but also departments so we've got sales sort of here this is how we kind of process and manage our orders Operations is the second person here which we have Calvin who works on most of that that's basically ensuring that the orders get placed so the warehouse knows what to put in the box and then Topher here is technical support so if you ever have any issues with any of your products he's the one making sure that the warranty claims are processed and everything goes off without a hitch we're gonna go show you the warehouse and kind of where they make the sausage welcome to our warehouse we have a 40,000 square foot facility complete with logistics technical capabilities shipping receiving everything that is needed so actually Kelvin that you met earlier rides his bike to work every single day rain shine unless it's snowing out he's on his bike so what we have here is our shipping and logistics area the items that you guys order that Calvin processes will get pulled from our stock brought over here packaged and then brought over here and then Aaron will ship them out all right so that just about does it FedEx and UPS are picking up right now so your orders are on the way thanks so much for watching our video and as promised I have some coupon codes for you please scroll down to the description section of this video and you'll find a 10% site-wide coupon for everything on our store good through cyber monday you'll also find additional coupon codes for battleborn lithium ion products as well as TST tire pressure monitoring products please act on those coupons because we likely will not be able to offer those discounts in the future as this is part of our grand opening thank you so much for watching our video and we will see you on the road don't

{"id": "x5XTp9s_Wgc", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "mucIntjtPgu9UZVwFww46SBl20A", "transcript": "welcome to mobile must-haves my name is Andy and on today's video we're gonna talk about the five and one MIMO antenna [Music] now a lot of you have purchased a pep wave unit which is a great LTE modem for internet while on the road but another great option or kind of an add-on to this if you don't want to use the standard kind of thin antennas that come with it is a MIMO five and one kind of roof antenna we're not going to go through the full instructions on how to install it today but we are going to show you how to get it connected to your device so you can use it out of the box later in a following video we will show you how to install this on your roof but again for today we're just going to go through the setup if you have any questions on how to set up your pet wave unit use the links below in the description for that video alright so the first challenge is getting it out of the box well though there's not much in it way it's packaged as nice we're gonna feed the cables through the box okay so now that we have the MIMO out of the box there are a couple different ways you can mount this to the vehicle of your choice there's two different things you can do with the cables and then a couple different ways you can get this to actually stick to the top for the cable so you can have them as they are now kind of just coming right at the bottom this is a great option if you're drilling a hole through the roof of let's say like an RV or something or like a big van you can do that and the cables will just come right through all of those kind of get its are in the bag to come with it the other option is as you can take this off and half the cables come out the back so when this sits flush there's enough room for all the cables to come out and then you can push the cables through a seam or something else in the vehicle that is a really popular solution when you're using the magnetic mounting option so this is when you're actually sticking this to the top of your unit you can use some magnets if you want if you're using like an aluminum roof or a truck or something like that or if you're doing an RV you can use this sticky pad and you can just directly kind of I hear this to the roof of the of the vehicle so you're mounting options now it was set up it's pretty simple this comes with a default five kind of foot cable cord there is an extension however if you're going to use the extension you won't get all the power from the antenna that it's initially intended for so you want to keep the extension only if you really truly need it we're gonna probably mount this in the next video directly behind the screen there and then the antenna is gonna go directly above the roof on top of our RV so that's where this is gonna go and how we're planning man with the five and one it is one antenna with five different things that it does and hence its name each of these kind of cables is going to be color-coded for where it needs to be connected to on the pathway there are two adapters in the back so these two gold adapters are for the Wi-Fi connections you can put these on the pep wave side or the antenna side it doesn't really matter which way they go but it won't connect without them so make sure you don't throw them away make sure you keep them and quite simply they just will screw right on the ends there alright so now we have both of our adapters connected we're going to take our green cables and we're going to screw one end on each side it does not matter which one goes to which end all right and the most complicated to them they're done it's pretty simple alright so again Green is for Wi-Fi if you're looking at these are gonna see a kind of a 2.4 gigahertz and a 5 gigahertz you know those are the Wi-Fi I'm kind of signals so there we go that's how we know they're Wi-Fi now on the other side is where these other three are going to go we have two cell phone inputs and we have a GPS input cell phone ones are going to be these maroon cables and then the GPS says GPS which is good that will go in the middle this does take a bit of stretch to get this done I have found so you're really going to kind of have to work the cables make sure you go over the top of the unit because if you're mounting the unit anywhere the unit is gonna have to be flush again saying you don't the cables back there it is it is a tight fit but you can get them so just kind of work with it and be patient be gentle though it does not require any forcing you don't want these cables to break I also try not to twist them up any more than need it up on the top all right and then the last one for the GPS goes in the middle there we go so now we have all this is how we basically connect the the pep wave unit with the with the MIMO now we're going to talk about mounting options for the MIMO like I said it does come with the kind of through the roof method kind of pre done if you want to change it to going out the back you're gonna have to twist off that bottom piece and run that off the wires go just kind of run that all the way down once you do that you can also pull this is like a big kind of silicon rubber piece peel that off this will also be fed all the way down and we need to take off this very bottom piece which is going to connect it and kind of hold this the center console on now there are two of these different sizes for links so if you did need a longer one so your roof is thicker you need more protection in this bag you can see there's a big long one that's going to be probably closer to three and a half inches where you can do that so I'm going to take these off and I'll show you the next step now that we have that center piece removed we can see it's very easy to kind of just push this cable down into the channel and to keep it in the channel so it doesn't pop out or cause any problems inside that plastic bag we got are a couple of these clips and these clips will screw in with the screws that are included and hold that in place there are two of those okay there you go now you can set the whole unit flat and it will stay flat that is kind of the idea okay so once you've established the right way you want to connect the cable in you know two options from there if you want to stick this to the top of your unit to the top of your RV there are circles that will go in place here that becomes a full sticking surface or sticker on both sides so you can just adhere that right to the roof it's a good sticker it's made by 3m it's not going to go anywhere you can stick that right on feed the cable through maybe the refrigerator vent or other options and that is not a bad way to go now the other option is using these magnets so these magnets are optional mounting hardware that come with it they are very strong and they screw right into the unit which we'll show you in just a second and this way the unit is a little bit easier to remove if you go with the magnetic option though there is a suggestion I have for you which is to buy on Amazon a neoprene sheet and this is basically gonna go between the vehicle and the magnets so doesn't scratch and rattle as much we'll show that on the install but for today we're just gonna show you how to get these magnets on as they are a little tricky since they are very strong and but that's pretty straightforward alright so we're gonna take off the first magnet and when you do that you're gonna notice there's like a clear silver there's like this little white ring around it that's actually just there so you can get the magnets apart it's just packing the chair you really don't need it you take the the magnet and you're going to push it into the hole it should fit just fine and it's gonna come with six little screws we're going to take a screw out and the screw goes right in the middle and is gonna hold this now in place changes you know what if it's not the prettiest looking for a driver but it is super functional okay alright so now we're going to just screw in the magnet there we go so again you would do this for all six and then you have a strong magnetic surface to adhere this to so this can go anywhere all right so I'm going to do the rest of this and then we will hook it up to our pet wave [Music] okay and there you go so now all the magnets are installed and the next step would be to take a neoprene sit it on the table and I would do this outside or on definitely not on your nice kitchen table and with a razor blade just trace the outsides of this so you get the same sign so you don't need any hanging out any over the edge you just need enough to kind of cover cover the bottom so doesn't scratch the roof all right in the next video we're going to talk about and show you actually how to install this thank you guys so much for joining me on this video today if you haven't already make sure you subscribe to the mobile must-haves channel as we are pushing out a lot of videos about everything you need to stay connected while on the move thank you guys so much for joining me my name is Andy and I'll see you

first can talk about sizes of SIM cards what they interact with how to break them apart if they came in like a combo card then we're going to move into what devices take what size of cards and how to get one into a pep wave yet which we have is our sample unit here today and then if you need to ever remove or reset a something with a SIM card how to do that as well [Music] alright so first if you got a SIM card from living light on that or mobile must-haves you're going to probably get it in a card similar to this the first thing we're going to want to do is break it out in its full size I've already done that for this card actually so this one will just kind of pop out but be careful when you do this to to kind of not break out any you want this full size the full standard sim card size to come over now this is the standard or full size it's also called the two FF size if you flip it over I guess depending on which side you're looking at you can see kind of the different rings around it and these rings can actually be made in two different size SIM cards now for our pep wave in particular we actually want to keep this standard size this is the size we're looking for but if you needed to take it down to a micro size just be careful to punch out just kind of on the right lines they come out pretty easily and we can just kind of punch out into that that smaller size now I have a t-mobile kind of sample one here too you can see on the t-mobile and they only have the text for for the t-mobile on the nano one and if you flip it over you can say the colors change depending on what size you want now if you needed to go up a size and you still had kind of the original casing that the SIM card came in it will just kind of very easily snap back into place and will hold just fine so you don't really need to do anything else it will it will stay in place however if you've lost that original casing you can go and get one of these this would be like a sim card adapter and these come with kind of five major five major tools and um you've got different sizes you can make the SIM card you've got like a like a push pin a file and that's just to help you get down to a different size so let's say you were at the micro size and you needed to go back up to the standard you could push these together and they will make a new standard or again that 2ff size SIM card if you were at the Nano and you need to go to micro there's one if you wanted to go to micro to full or you could do the standard if you need it if you notice there's a really tight fit and you uh it was too tight and it wasn't gonna come out or wasn't going in very easily and you know it's facing the right way they do provide a file where you can file these down so those edges will fit better but another one on our pep we're actually going to put in two SIM cards into this unit we're gonna first start with our AT&T we're going to push it back together so because we need that the standard full-size SIM card so there we go we have a full sized sim on the pep wave we're gonna turn it over we're gonna go to the I guess the top of the unit over here you're gonna see the direction the Sims need to face so for slot na the top one we need to be facing this way and for slot B you can see with the notch the notch is the important part and for spot B we need to go this way the way I think of it is the knotch goes in and the metal goes down on the top or up on the bottom the metal always wants to be facing the other slot so again some knotch goes in metal down and we're just going to slide that in now you can actually push this and you'll hear it click and that click kind of says it's been received when you want to remove this you can push it again and that will then come back out it's much easier to push so listen fit I click but don't push hard I know the first time I actually push this one in there was no click because they click had already been pushed in so you should always be able to see a little bit of the tail of the card kind of sticking out and and it should be very easy to go in and out if it does and don't force it you might have it the wrong way so double check now I have a second sim I'm going to put the again the medal now on the bottom is gonna go up and the tab is gonna go in we're gonna go right into slot B oh sorry you couldn't see it and uh again you're gonna push it in now again that one already had that click pushed in so we didn't want to push it anymore but if we do a gentle push we'll see then it kind of pushes itself back out then we can push it in and there's that clicking sound so once they're both in then we can take our cover we can screw our cover back in and we're good to go all right guys well that is everything you need to know about Sims in our three minute video thank you so much for watching and we will see you in the next video thank you [Music]", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2019-11-27T17:49:02Z", "channelId":

using the br1 um mk2 pep wave but most of what we're going to show today is relevant to all pep wave units so you you don't have this exact one you should be able to follow along just fine in today's video we're going to get you from basically getting it out of the box to connecting to the internet we're going to try and keep it short but make sure you have all the information at the same time what we're going to do is we're going to first install the sim uh showing you how the sim installation works then we're going to um talk about power and installing power then once you figure out power then we'll do antennas and show you how to get online should be fun all right let's get to it [Music] all right everyone now so the first step is we're going to take the unit out of the box um and yours might be in a plastic bag so remove that and then we're going to work on our sim cards uh the first thing we need to do is remove um the dust cover that's kind of just protecting every from dust getting in and you just need a simple small kind of phillips head screwdriver all right now that the dust cover is removed off the sim slots you'll see two slots and there's even directions kind of on the orientation of the slot which we'll hit in a second if your card came in a a full sheet like this we're going to need to punch it out so just be careful to uh to not break it or break the card you need it to come out in this full size there's two durians this could be a standard or a 2ff size and this is what the pep wave needs now in some cases you might have a smaller sim card if you're moving from like a a verizon pack or something like that you may need to buy a a small kind of sim adapter um and this will allow it to go back into the pep wave make sure you use only full-size sims to get them uh into the pep wave anything smaller will get lost and break it so we need a full-size sim just make sure it's oriented the same way as the pictures on the bottoms this would be b this is a and the metal pieces on one side of the sim always need to face the other slots so the top slot would be metal down bottom slot metal up now when you push these in um they should fit pretty snug but they shouldn't you shouldn't have to force it in if you're forcing it you might have it oriented the wrong way so double check your orientation and then you should be able to just kind of push it in and you'll hear it click don't push any further than that and that allows it actually to kind of get it in and out easily so if you wanted to get it out you can push in again and then the card will kind of push itself out so it's really easy to hold on to i have found that sometimes that that kind of push mechanism is already pushed in so if you don't hear a click don't over force it um sometimes if it's in already you could just push again and you'll feel it and so you'll know when it's in you'll know when it's out you can kind of you'll feel that basically though this is how far it should be faced when it's in this is all the way in there it will still stick out a bit now if you're putting the sim on the bottom because you have a second sim that's fine just make sure the metal is side up and then you can push it in again listen for the click and then you can push back and it'll it'll come back to you so all right we're gonna leave ours on the top we heard the click now we can replace our dust cover all right now let's not talk about power and i'm gonna do power next because it's just easier to work with the box before we put the antennas on it you have two options for power the first is your standard ac power the ac power cord will come in the box it's a standard kind of 110 um plug with with a power unit that would go in the back your other option which you might have to order optionally would be a dc power cable this would go directly onto a battery or any other kind of 12 volt source you might have in your rv you could probably hotwire it into like a light switch or any other maybe 12 volt wiring you have nearby where you're going to install this main unit we're not going to go over the actual install today but you will see on this pack there are two cables that are actually finely finished you have a true you know end kind of connection on those these are the sides that are going to go into the pep wave on the back here you have a green kind of connector this will come out so you can connect the wires with this and then push it in that's probably what we'll do today but once you remove this you'll see there are four kind of holes you'll see a minus two options and then a plus that is where the cable will go so i'll just show you how to install this real quick so the minus is the black that is going all the way on this side basically you're going to push that piece all the way in and then you're going to need a tiny screwdriver to close and actually screw in this top part all right there and it's a small one so it's like a size like a sunglass kind of kind of flat head or something like that but once you push that wire in you can tighten down that screw and you can make sure it's held tight so obviously we need to go some more all right and then give it a pull if it doesn't come out you're all set then we'll put the positive in on the other side there so now that they're attached you can push this part in and then this would allow dc to go to the unit um it doesn't really matter from a preference angle it's more of just kind of your setup i like having it on dc that way during a drive day and when i'm not on shore power uh the unit's getting basically powered directly from the battery it's much more energy efficient that way and i just think you get a lot more use out of it than when you uh have to run a generator or an inverter to just invert back into dc anyways but i understand also it's a little bit extra of a step all right so now that we have our power sorted and where you're going to plug it in the next is going to be antennas now this is where your unit might show different antennas this one in particular has five antennas some have three four seven there's different variables here but all of them will still operate the same way the antennas all of the antennas are really important to connect even if you're not going to use that service it just it helps with interference and other things now so for example these thin antennas and in this current one are for the wi-fi this is what's going to pick up wi-fi around you and allow it to be received into the pep wave unit itself and then these bigger fan ones are for receiving the cell phone signal if you look on the unit itself it will tell you where these are going to go so we have a wi-fi antenna up here a and b on this side and then on this side we have a cellular a gps and another cellular antenna again yours might be different i know i actually have installed behind the tv a mini unit and i only have antennas on the top of the unit and i think there's like one cellular one wi-fi and something else so uh so just check your unit it'll tell you which way they go in also on this particular unit i can't install the let's say the cell phone on the wi-fi it just doesn't fit so if they don't fit double check that it doesn't need to go somewhere else all right so i said the big fat ones are on the cell phone side so we'll be gentle screwing these in you want to push them in until they kind of stop turning and then just make sure they're snug don't go any more than that and we'll do the same thing for this sign snug and then tight and then you can fold these up and fold them so they face kind of over the uh the front of the logo itself because you're going to mount it on the other side all right so now we have our two wi-fi antennas there's a and b again tight we'll face it upwards now this unit does come with a gps antenna um this one ideally this antenna here you would ideally run up to some point on your roof around the exterior of the rv it has a pretty long cable that then can attach directly into the unit of the pep wave itself this will actually tell you where your unit is so as long as your unit has power which again is great if you're on dc um and the unit is well you'll be able to look up where the unit is now that's all part of the section we'll get to later but that's where this antenna is this is the only in my opinion optional antenna i haven't had one installed on ours just yet but all the other antennas are very important to put on because they each have a purpose for the unit so make sure you install all the antennas okay well really at this point we are we're ready to mount it and install it now i'm not going to do this and this is not an install video this is just more of a setup so at this point go and mount this where you're going to have yours and then provide power and we'll meet you back here all right so now i'm going to show you what the power up cycle looks like i have just plugged ours in and with that we're going to get a red status appearing first this is in its boot cycle it's totally fine we're going to wait for all three lights to turn green now that we have all three lights on the status the wi-fi and the cellular we know the unit is fully booted now we're going to take a device and connect it to the wi-fi the pep wave is creating the next step is to grab a device and you need to have one that connects to wi-fi and has a browser and we're going to look for the wi-fi signal to find the name of the wi-fi unit flip the pep wave to the back and you're going to see on the second line the serial number the last four of the serial number is going to be the the wi-fi name so it's going to say pep wave and mine says cf i'm sorry 6 6fc4 yours will say a different code but along the same you'll see pep wave and then that number or code so here mine is on our wi-fi network on our device i'm going to tap that and i'm presented with a password the password can also be found on the bottom of your pep wave in this case it says ap password but it also will be the last eight of the mac address so we'll type this in you hit join up at the top and you'll see kind of that circle spinning and now that we're connected and that's really it that's all you have to do now if you would like one of these units set up and configured for you we do offer that service there is an email in the description below and i'll put it right here if you email us we can offer that service to you for a fee but at this point you're connected and you're ready to go if you wanted to change the name of the wi-fi or change the password you can do all of that um the easiest thing to do is just to open a browser go to the following address 192.168.50.1 let's see that on the top and this will bring you to the kind of the back end pep wave system the username is admin the password is admin and you are all logged in from here you can make any changes that you want again if you want anything configured by us or if you need assistance at this level you can email us below we offer a service to help you get anything else you need set up at this point thank you so much for joining us on the video today on how to set up your pep wave and we will see you in the next video bye [Music] you", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2019-10-08T19:39:02Z",
