# Task

- Read the documents supplied in the user message.
- Identify one topic / product / technology / concept that appears in multiple documents.
- Craft one focused **complex, multi-hop technician query** that can be answered only by **synthesising several inter-related facts** from **several different documents**.

# Evidence requirement tiers

1. Preferred: Use ≥ 5 distinct facts drawn from ≥ 3 different documents.
2. Limited evidence: If the corpus contains 3–4 connectable facts spanning ≥ 2 documents, use all of them.
3. Insufficient evidence: If fewer than 2 documents contain connectable facts, return empty values for every field of the response.

# Answer

- Answer the query using only information from the documents.
- For every atomic claim in the answer, create a `FactCitation` with a short paraphrased fact plus the names of the supporting documents.
- Ignore vague, contradictory, or off-topic content.
