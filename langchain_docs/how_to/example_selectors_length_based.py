# # How to select examples by length
#
# This [example selector](/docs/concepts/example_selectors/) selects which examples to use based on length. This is useful when you are worried about constructing a prompt that will go over the length of the context window. For longer inputs, it will select fewer examples to include, while for shorter inputs it will select more.
