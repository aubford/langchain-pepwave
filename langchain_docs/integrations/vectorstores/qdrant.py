# # Qdrant
# 
# >[Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/) (read: quadrant) is a vector similarity search engine. It provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage vectors with additional payload and extended filtering support. It makes it useful for all sorts of neural network or semantic-based matching, faceted search, and other applications.
# 
# This documentation demonstrates how to use Qdrant with LangChain for dense (i.e., embedding-based), sparse (i.e., text search) and hybrid retrieval. The `QdrantVectorStore` class supports multiple retrieval modes via Qdrant's new [Query API](https://qdrant.tech/blog/qdrant-1.10.x/). It requires you to run Qdrant v1.10.0 or above.
# 
# 
# ## Setup
# 
# There are various modes of how to run `Qdrant`, and depending on the chosen one, there will be some subtle differences. The options include:
# - Local mode, no server required
# - Docker deployments
# - Qdrant Cloud
# 
# Please see the installation instructions [here](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/install/).

# In[ ]:


pip install -qU langchain-qdrant


# ### Credentials
# 
# There are no credentials needed to run the code in this notebook.
# 
# If you want to get best in-class automated tracing of your model calls you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:

# In[ ]:


# os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your LangSmith API key: ")
# os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"


# ## Initialization
# 
# ### Local mode
# 
# The Python client provides the option to run the code in local mode without running the Qdrant server. This is great for testing things out and debugging or storing just a small amount of vectors. The embeddings can be kept fully in-memory or persisted on-disk.
# 
# #### In-memory
# 
# For some testing scenarios and quick experiments, you may prefer to keep all the data in-memory only, so it gets removed when the client is destroyed - usually at the end of your script/notebook.

from langchain_qdrant import QdrantVectorStore
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
from qdrant_client.http.models import Distance, VectorParams

client = QdrantClient(":memory:")

client.create_collection(
    collection_name="demo_collection",

)

vector_store = QdrantVectorStore(
    client=client,
    collection_name="demo_collection",
    embedding=embeddings,
)


# #### On-disk storage
# 
# Local mode, without using the Qdrant server, may also store your vectors on-disk so they persist between runs.

# In[7]:


client = QdrantClient(path="/tmp/langchain_qdrant")

client.create_collection(
    collection_name="demo_collection",
    vectors_config=VectorParams(size=3072, distance=Distance.COSINE),
)

vector_store = QdrantVectorStore(
    client=client,
    collection_name="demo_collection",
    embedding=embeddings,
)


# ### On-premise server deployment
# 
# No matter if you choose to launch Qdrant locally with [a Docker container](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/install/) or select a Kubernetes deployment with [the official Helm chart](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant-helm), the way you're going to connect to such an instance will be identical. You'll need to provide a URL pointing to the service.

# In[5]:


url = "<---qdrant url here --->"
docs = []  # put docs here
qdrant = QdrantVectorStore.from_documents(
    docs,
    embeddings,
    url=url,
    prefer_grpc=True,
    collection_name="my_documents",
)


# ### Qdrant Cloud
# 
# If you prefer not to keep yourself busy with managing the infrastructure, you can choose to set up a fully-managed Qdrant cluster on [Qdrant Cloud](https://cloud.qdrant.io/). There is a free forever 1GB cluster included for trying out. The main difference with using a managed version of Qdrant is that you'll need to provide an API key to secure your deployment from being accessed publicly. The value can also be set in a `QDRANT_API_KEY` environment variable.

# In[6]:


url = "<---qdrant cloud cluster url here --->"
api_key = "<---api key here--->"
qdrant = QdrantVectorStore.from_documents(
    docs,
    embeddings,
    url=url,
    prefer_grpc=True,
    api_key=api_key,
    collection_name="my_documents",
)


# ## Using an existing collection

# To get an instance of `langchain_qdrant.Qdrant` without loading any new documents or texts, you can use the `Qdrant.from_existing_collection()` method.

# In[ ]:


qdrant = QdrantVectorStore.from_existing_collection(
    embedding=embeddings,
    collection_name="my_documents",
    url="http://localhost:6333",
)


# ## Manage vector store
# 
# Once you have created your vector store, we can interact with it by adding and deleting different items.
# 
# ### Add items to vector store
# 
# We can add items to our vector store by using the `add_documents` function.

# ### Delete items from vector store

# In[37]:


vector_store.delete(ids=[uuids[-1]])


# ## Query vector store
# 
# Once your vector store has been created and the relevant documents have been added, you will most likely wish to query it during the running of your chain or agent. 
# 
# ### Query directly
# 
# The simplest scenario for using the Qdrant vector store is to perform a similarity search. Under the hood, our query will be encoded into vector embeddings and used to find similar documents in a Qdrant collection.

# In[10]:


results = vector_store.similarity_search(
    "LangChain provides abstractions to make working with LLMs easy", k=2
)
for res in results:
    print(f"* {res.page_content} [{res.metadata}]")


# `QdrantVectorStore` supports 3 modes for similarity searches. They can be configured using the `retrieval_mode` parameter.
# 
# - Dense Vector Search (default)
# - Sparse Vector Search
# - Hybrid Search
# 
# ### Dense Vector Search
# 
# Dense vector search involves calculating similarity via vector-based embeddings. To search with only dense vectors:
# 
# - The `retrieval_mode` parameter should be set to `RetrievalMode.DENSE`. This is the default behavior.
# - A [dense embeddings](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/text_embedding/) value should be provided to the `embedding` parameter.

)

qdrant.add_documents(documents=documents, ids=uuids)

query = "How much money did the robbers steal?"
found_docs = qdrant.similarity_search(query)
found_docs


# ### Sparse Vector Search
# 
# To search with only sparse vectors:
# 
# - The `retrieval_mode` parameter should be set to `RetrievalMode.SPARSE`.
# - An implementation of the [`SparseEmbeddings`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/libs/partners/qdrant/langchain_qdrant/sparse_embeddings.py) interface using any sparse embeddings provider has to be provided as a value to the `sparse_embedding` parameter.
# 
# The `langchain-qdrant` package provides a [FastEmbed](https://github.com/qdrant/fastembed) based implementation out of the box.
# 
# To use it, install the FastEmbed package.

# ### Hybrid Vector Search
# 
# To perform a hybrid search using dense and sparse vectors with score fusion,
# 
# - The `retrieval_mode` parameter should be set to `RetrievalMode.HYBRID`.
# - A [dense embeddings](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/text_embedding/) value should be provided to the `embedding` parameter.
# - An implementation of the [`SparseEmbeddings`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/libs/partners/qdrant/langchain_qdrant/sparse_embeddings.py) interface using any sparse embeddings provider has to be provided as a value to the `sparse_embedding` parameter.
# 
# Note that if you've added documents with the `HYBRID` mode, you can switch to any retrieval mode when searching, since both the dense and sparse vectors are available in the collection.

# 
# ### Metadata filtering
# 
# Qdrant has an [extensive filtering system](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/filtering/) with rich type support. It is also possible to use the filters in Langchain, by passing an additional param to both the `similarity_search_with_score` and `similarity_search` methods.

# In[14]:


from qdrant_client import models

results = vector_store.similarity_search(
    query="Who are the best soccer players in the world?",
    k=1,
    filter=models.Filter(
        should=[
            models.FieldCondition(
                key="page_content",
                match=models.MatchValue(

                ),
            ),
        ]
    ),
)
for doc in results:
    print(f"* {doc.page_content} [{doc.metadata}]")


# ### Query by turning into retriever
# 
# You can also transform the vector store into a retriever for easier usage in your chains. 

# In[15]:


retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(search_type="mmr", search_kwargs={"k": 1})
retriever.invoke("Stealing from the bank is a crime")


# ## Usage for retrieval-augmented generation
# 
# For guides on how to use this vector store for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), see the following sections:
# 
# - [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials/)
# - [How-to: Question and answer with RAG](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/#qa-with-rag)
# - [Retrieval conceptual docs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/retrieval)

# ## Customizing Qdrant
# 
# There are options to use an existing Qdrant collection within your LangChain application. In such cases, you may need to define how to map Qdrant point into the LangChain `Document`.
# 
# ### Named vectors
# 
# Qdrant supports [multiple vectors per point](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/collections/#collection-with-multiple-vectors) by named vectors. If you work with a collection created externally or want to have the differently named vector used, you can configure it by providing its name.

# ### Metadata
# 
# Qdrant stores your vector embeddings along with the optional JSON-like payload. Payloads are optional, but since LangChain assumes the embeddings are generated from the documents, we keep the context data, so you can extract the original texts as well.
# 
# By default, your document is going to be stored in the following payload structure:
# 
# ```json
# {
#     "page_content": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet",
#     "metadata": {
#         "foo": "bar"
#     }
# }
# ```
# 
# You can, however, decide to use different keys for the page content and metadata. That's useful if you already have a collection that you'd like to reuse.
