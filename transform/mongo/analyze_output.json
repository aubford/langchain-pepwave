The former enables you to have internet access at even an extremely remote location, and the latter keeps you connected even when there are plenty of obstructions in the view of the sky. That’s why a big fan of Starlink also uses Peplink while on the go. Their complementary abilities allow them to bring the highest possible uptime to you together.\n\nRead this article from FulfillingTravel now for a deeper understanding of Starlink, and why a Starlink user still needs Peplink.\n\n[Read Now](https://www.fulfillingtravel.com/starlink-internet-guide/)",

The mobile medical unit has gone through several network upgrades, but it has always been with Peplink.\n\nJerry’s passion for mobilizing healthcare, Peter’s passion for solving connectivity problems, and their trust in Peplink led to the creation of the Jerry McLarty Grant four years ago. This is the fifth year of the program, and we’re proud to support it.\n\nThe Jerry McLarty Grant will be awarded at the annual Mobile Health Clinics Conference in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania September 9-12, 2023. The recipient of the Grant will receive a set of Peplink products with free installation and technical support provided by West Networks. \n\nLearn more about the Grant and how to apply for it now.\n\n[Learn More](https://westnetworks.com/2023/03/27/the-jerry-mclarty-connectivity-grant/)",

The record long distance that a LoRa packet travels between a node and a gateway is 832 km! This means that with LoRaWAN, you can install devices like sensors miles away and build up a large-scale IoT network. And with centrally managed gateways (or routers with gateway functionality like Peplink), you can easily scale your IoT network even further.\n\nFind out why other options aren't quite right.\n\nWant to learn more?

That's okay. Bring 5G into your warehouses with a Peplink 5G router, even one as small as the BR1 Pro 5G. With multiple Internet sources for more redundancy, patented Hot Failover for truly seamless backup, and private 5G support for greater control and better data security - there's no reason you shouldn't try it. One MSP has already integrated it into their solution to power up robotics and IoT devices in their customer's smart warehouse. How about you? \n\n[Read the Article](https://www.peplink.com/peplink-5g-routers-in-smart-warehouses-make-the-most-of-indoor-5g/)",

And that's exactly why Medical Teams International replaced their previous router with Peplink. The combination of the HD4 MBX router and the Mobility 40G antenna enables the NPO to have reliable Internet access even in rural areas. This is the key to extending services to more patients in a lot more locations.
