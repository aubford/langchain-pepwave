# # Tair
# 
# >[Tair](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/tair/latest/what-is-tair) is a cloud native in-memory database service developed by `Alibaba Cloud`. 
# It provides rich data models and enterprise-grade capabilities to support your real-time online scenarios while maintaining full compatibility with open-source `Redis`. `Tair` also introduces persistent memory-optimized instances that are based on the new non-volatile memory (NVM) storage medium.
# 
# This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the `Tair` vector database.
# 
# You'll need to install `langchain-community` with `pip install -qU langchain-community` to use this integration
# 
# To run, you should have a `Tair` instance up and running.
