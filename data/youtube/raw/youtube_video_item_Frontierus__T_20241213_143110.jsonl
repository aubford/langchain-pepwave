{"id": "byYp2KTSYSs", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "28dYvj9CuJAaRlcx4wP3zowlSKw", "transcript": "hi everyone thank you so much for joining us for sp1 and Peplink what you need to know this webinar with frontier computer board my name is Matt Roni I'm on the marketing team at frontier computer course and I am joined by our director of strategic accounts Michael Maitland he'll be presenting on st-1 and Peplink and their relationship I will be taking your questions throughout I will be asking Mike those questions once the initial presentation is wrapped up once again thank you so much for being here and Mike take it away thank you Matt and thank you everyone for joining today my name is Michael Maitland and I'm the director of strategic accounts upfront to your computer I've been with frontier computer Court for over 10 years and 9 plus years of those I've been working directly with Peplink its products and its solutions today we're going to dig into SD win but not at a technical deep dive level we're going to be talking through some general high-level overviews so that you can touch on the different pieces of SDRAM with that being said the things and topics we'll cover today is what is SDRAM the benefits of SD win SD win market overview how Peplink an esky win fit together in the role frontier plays in that with that being said what is SD man first SDRAM is an acronym for software-defined wide area network and it's a virtual LAN architecture that allows enterprises to leverage any combination of transport services these could be MPLS LTE VSAT broadband DSL if it's IP based you name it it can be used but what's driving us demand in the need for SD Wham well that is from the digital transformation digital transformation is the use of new and fast and frequently changing digital technologies to solve problems it's about transforming processes that were non digital or manual to digital processes and one of the best examples of this is the digital transformation to cloud computing cloud computing is growing at a kegger of about 20 percent per year that's outpacing IT as a whole which is growing at only three to four percent so optimizing St want optimizes the LAN for the cloud and makes it more agile and network on the LAN what comprises the best you win Gartner helped us solidify SD ran into four characteristics these are pretty straightforward characteristics that can go into much more detail but those are supports multiple connection types capable of dynamic path selection third is being able to manage the land through a simple interface or platform supports VPNs and other third-party management like fire or services like firewalls or optimization controllers and digging and we'll dig into each of these more first supports multiple connection types the usual LAN challenges like high latency packet loss and bandwidth limitations congestion Xand costs can all be solved with the help of SDRAM by using flexible affordable commodity lines to either replace or augment and MPLS connections you can create fast reliable and affordable data transfers between data centers and peers but having multiple LANs is not just does not just create SD LAN you need to be able to intelligently use those paths with dynamic path selection DPS enables the simultaneous use of multiple LAN links it automatically fails over to the secondary connection in the event of a LAN how is your Brown oh it directs traffic to the optimal path or distributes traffic across the selected path basically it allows you to use these multiple paths as you choose for each specific application create creating better failover load balancing usage the third characteristic dusty land is it's able to manage through a simple easy-to-use interface now these can be this can be taken to a much greater level many have cloud platforms that allow single touch or zero touch configuration notifications give insight to every device that you have on your network from the WAM side configure management assigned configurations or devices you're able to push these out to one device or multiple devices in the group able to choose and create firewall rules or outbound policies and also schedule for example Wi-Fi or firewall rules usually these are hosted publicly but can also be hosted privately in some instances and lastly st LAN is able to support VPNs and third-party services so now to touch more on on what the benefits of SD lan is first if we take a look at what a traditional LAN network looks like it's highly predictable but very inflexible and not efficient at all for today's shift to cloud applications along with the big push to mobile users and the increase of bandwidth demands by leveraging a few LAN and the lower costs more readily available commodity links we're able to decrease costs increase agility have better application performance across the multiple wins and allow for the most flexible and expedited deployments looking at from a more specific to a role in in regards to the benefits we take to take network admins for example traditionally they had to touch every device and configure every device separately that was on the network this took time cost cost money to travel and was frankly probably quite frustrating as well with SD wanne it's made network admins life's much easier in many aspects first single zero touch configuration being able to send a device out and just have to have that location plug it in and connect it and able to push down configurations make changes remotely create a high level efficiency for these MOS network admins you also have much more increased insight into these remote devices the ability to pull reports set notifications and warnings to be notified when something happens is extremely helpful it also increases the flexibility for the network admins many more choices in regards to links that can be used how to separate and drive applications down certain paths increasing availability of those high cost MPLS lines if still used many ways that the flexibility supports SD Wham and lastly decrease deployment time we talked on when you have to touch the device in every location and the pains that they can do being able to configure and and deploy devices remotely greatly decreases that time to deploy and enterprise as a whole a lot of the movement to the cloud is increasing greater need for connectivity and throughput and bandwidth sd1 tackles this head-on it's able to create a lot more bandwidth throughput without increasing the costs many times the costs are decreased we've seen costs average about decrease from from reports I read of 30% when deploying Sdn we've seen numbers as high as 80 or 90 percent on cost they're saving but every network is different and a lot depends on how the current infrastructure is set up also the increased agility across across the land different different deployment tapes like privately hosted hardware our virtual appliance as well as a range of devices make it flexible to meet your deployment needs and lastly a better user experience frankly the user doesn't know if there's SD when involved or not at many times but they can experience it without even knowing everyone's been on a phone call webinar or anything that could get disconnected through traditional means at that time you no longer have connectivity you have to reconnect or terminate or reinitiate that connection with SD wanne and the failover and load balancing capabilities that user has session persistence and those applications great session persistence being able to have a better user experience throughout their benefits for managed service providers first the increase flexibility as we talked on easy deploy manage and more options for SAS solutions so you're able to put programs that fit your needs and enable to market that out to your customers that's the win market as a whole is very interesting and there are a lot of things driving the fast increasing growth of SD WAM a few of those drivers include the adoption in SD ran into manufacturing in IOT the growing need among organizations to simplify network management implementation of SD land 4 kappa and ibex savings the flexibility basically of SD lan and the way you propose that to your customers can greatly help on closing these opportunities increased business agility and responsiveness and rapid migration towards the cloud in 2017 st wayne had a market cap of 1 billion dollars that's approaching 8 billion dollars for 2021 but as you can see in 2026 the growth will be 230 billion dollars that's a average overall growth per year of 30% of that America or North America will hold up market share of about 45% of that so there's great opportunity and a lot of adoption still in North America that we can focus on now to dig into SD win and the role Peplink plays and where they fit so I've mentioned before that I've been working with that Peplink for over nine years now and for a long time we'd meet with marketing I'd meet with leadership at public and we discussed how we truly explain and just talk about the cufflinks capabilities in multi wanne and their VPN technologies we never really could put our finger on and when as soon as st man started to be popularized and discussed we knew exactly that we had found what Peplink has done public's been in this business for over 12 years they've been focused on creating the best est Wayne solutions before st Wayne was known and they continue to do so today four characteristics dusty one and we're kind of point out how peplum fits into each of those first multi wind capabilities multi-man is is really known around the Peplink users that's what their focus and expertise is whether it's multiple wired connections cellular connections or a combination of all of them Peplink has the widest broadest portfolio fd1 hardware products available on the market they can touch anything from small home office applications mid medium large businesses all the way up to enterprise and data centers now again it's not just the capability of using or connecting multiple land links but to be able to intelligently direct the the data down the different paths Peplink software outbound policies capabilities that you can build in handle that very very effectively and third you need to be able to manage these devices from one platform then Peplink is continually working on their in control management to platform this is a one pane of glass access to all your devices and network information you're able to centralized firewall rules and outbound policies from a single pane of glass be able to push these policies to one device or multiple devices in a group of organization you can have comprehensive records of the networking systems and you can have all these reports sent to you automatically and set basically ic2 gives you access to the device from anywhere in the world and lastly and what I think is the most interesting is the way Peplink takes and handles VPN most people are used to traditional VPNs much like the vet pet VPN which is built over one link that's much more like an IPSec except that it only takes a couple minutes to configure and deploy but Peplink has other technologies for their VPN and multiple LAN solutions and and they're very much ahead of its time so first we have hop failover hop failover is where you can have multiple links connected to the VPN but you use one as primary if that primary fails at any time it will switch over to that secondary or third link with session persistence and that's what's so important session persistence being able to switch to another link and not drop your application not have a phone call terminated or your webinar closed the hop failover makes the user experience better next VPN technology we talked about his man smoothing this is a new technologist come up about over the last two years and one that we're seeing great adoption where when smoothing is where you use multiple links in your VPN and you send duplicate connections or packets down each of those links we see a great increase in adoption into broadcasting VoIP applications and live streaming with lan smoothing these these applications will only be more important as time moves forward and with a lot of more remote workforces and different things like that that are coming to play and Rance moving is a great way to meet those challenges last but not least we have bandwidth bonding this is what most people are interested in whether they need to use it or not but bandwidth bonding is able to take your multiple links or in connections and combine the speed in one big pipe you're able to create session persistence as links can drop in and drop out as they become healthy or unhealthy and you're able to increase speed and bandwidth you quick overview of some of the value props Peplink is able to bring to the table one of the biggest that you'll see consistently over this table here is the persistent failover so unbreakable connectivity is a model that Peplink lives by being able to focus both on multiple wired connections and what and but also wireless connections is a true competitive advantage for Peplink and Peplink is a team filled with creative and very very quality engineers and they're always looking to bring more and better solutions to the table a few things that we can talk on or will learn more about over the days months and quarters of calm are their Sdn controller with MSP level multi network visibility speed fusion cloud with unbreakable connectivity services and also fusion soon with virtualized sim management if any time you want to learn more about these please reach out to to frontier and we'd be happy to dig into those with you so now how does frontier fit in frontier us has been in business for more than 40 years and through that time we've been working with hardware the whole time we work with IBM HP son Dell but also have a lot of experience with the Peplink product lines we have unparalleled logistics and experience superior knowledge across all our product new lines that we are happy to share with our partners and we have dedicated trained certified sales and technical personnel with once again we are a resource to your team for Peplink specifically we've been working with them for nine years we were brought to Peplink because we started using their products in northern Michigan we didn't have a lot of quality connections available we've started with a 210 and we liked it so much that we became a reseller at that time we we quickly moved up their their pedestal or their program came a stocking distributor we're now distributor for both North America and Europe we understand their products and their capabilities very granulate and are happy to once again share that with our customers and partners if you'd like more information to become a Peplink reseller a partner please visit us at frontier us.com backslash resellers and with that being said we can move to questions great thanks Mike alright so this question comes from Sergio can sd1 be configured for in vehicle use for example switch LTE networks depending on geolocation is bandwidth bonding the feature that Sergio needs to look at for that or is there another feature that helps with that Sergio yes definitely cuff links to a broad portfolio of products focuses both on the wired side which you can see the Peplink balance but also the cellular side which are the peple wave devices peb wave has models that have one cellular modem two cellular modems for up to 18 active cellular modems that you can use together simultaneously you can spread traffic across those cellular connections you can bind those connections can create session persistence so yes very much Peplink does have the ability but also Sdn has the ability to to work in mobile applications Peplink just takes it to the next level with their focused portfolio on bended devices yeah actually it isn't uh I think transit and maritime those are all very uh big focus areas for Peplink yeah very very much so some of their two fastest growing markets great so uh and Thank You Sergio next question comes from Jay which is what sort of overhead or a bandwidth reduction should be expected with the speed fusion VPN yeah another great question one we see and it depends on the VPN you're using but if you're doing true bonding the speed fusion VPN where you're using multiple leaks to create a bigger a bigger path or bigger pipes per se that has an overhead of about twenty percent so and that's when and that's when you're doing encryption over that as well so to really do this and the best way you want to have more like connections or the same speed and latency do you have a thousand or a one gig line and a 10 10 Meg line the overhead will will take over the bandwidth increases so there is overhead range about 21st percent but it is different per pourer VPN type and we can talk more on that if you'd like to dig more offline thank you next question this one comes from Adam what solutions do you see used for inbound connectivity when using multiple when links considering there are different IP blocks in use well we get first of all by using multiple links on the inbound Peplink it has a great solution and works in drop-in mode you can have inbound primary link and subnet that all your applications are pointing towards but we can also point to a secondary or failover IP set on the second link that second link once those a bone sessions come in will then be forwarded on to the firewall we wonder one NAT and look like they're coming from the primary so that that that device can handle the routing internal pieces so you can create inbound well bouncing and failover as well with the Peplink devices to talk more in detail on that one we probably want to get an engineer look on the line with you Adam and we can dig in more awesome follow-up from earlier from Martin so you cannot bond VSAT and cellular because of the latency differences or can you we usually we usually do not see them bow bonded together because of those issues but we can see them utilized in the same VPN with different priority levels and so you can still create the session persistence over them great great that's great to know we had a question from Abraham about overseas distributors and where there would be distribution in Middle East or North Africa we are ourselves focused in North America although frontier does have a we do have a branch basically in Europe do you know what they cover by any chance Mike yeah yep they cover all of Europe but we also have we have a history of working with coupling for a long time and know a lot of their channel partners across the world those are made up of multiple distributors and resellers so if you'd like to for a specific area you can always reach out and we'll put you in touch with Peplink and the right partner to handle that or you can reach out to Pep link directly and they they will put you in touch with the with the partner in the area you're looking to deploy yeah happy to help you out the next question comes from Jack this one is we're looking to set up a fusion hub through AWS is the fusion hub limited to a specific group or can it be used at the organization level so can can Pep like I'm guessing public devices from different groups connect through the one fusion of them very good question oh I will one probably double check on this but I do believe that you can connect devices in the organization to the fusion hub directly now you want to be careful when you're doing that because different organizations will have different rules levels accessibility and different things like that but you should be able to use that fusion hub across the organization I will double check on that though with engineering great thank you had a comic come in from Mike my understanding is the Peplink speed fusion speed rating for each model is all connections combined in comparing to Meraki it seems like we need much bigger and more expensive appliances to get the same SD win performance what do you have what do you say to that Mike what we look at is we we look at the devices and we group do the throughput ratings as a whole so if the VPN rating says a hundred that's a combined 100 for up and down across all the multiple links that's the through point you can push through and that's also for a non VPN traffic is how it's judged it's not her link so we can talk more on the benefits or challenges of that compared to Meraki but that's how the Peplink devices are handled they're not licensing on those for increased bandwidth or throughput capabilities they are it's as a hardware spec that you have to look at got it all right I've got a pair of questions from Lauren first one is is a single site customer with speed fusion able to use hot failover and then can multiple customers be part of a single speed fusion hub can a single site use use speed fusion and hot failover what's the first question that was the first question okay yes so this is a VPN and site-to-site solution so there needs to be two endpoints now Peplink has understood that it does take then not everyone has this second location or or or data center capability and because of that they've hosted their own VPN termination point in AWS that can be used as a service and and that would allow you to get that hot failover capabilities at a single site locations in the second question the second question was and can multiple customers be part of a single speed fusion hub so if your speed fusion hub in the cloud you can connect multiple customers there again we'd want to look at the setup and the the access that's granted to that but once again on the deployment that configuration I probably want to talk more on and so if you want to follow up we can talk in more detail on that got it yeah Lauren feel free to follow up with us or if or if we're missing part of your question then - yeah no worries let's see oh we had a question from Martin who asked earlier about comment about bonding VSAT and cellular mention that he purchases a lot of Peplink products do you know if the power supplies can be europlugs instead of us plugs Martin to be clear we're a distributor of Peplink products rather than Peplink ourselves but uh yeah Mike is it possible to get power supplies in europlugs do you know it definitely is possible yes and they have all these products have very wide power ratings so they can handle on the different the different plugs as well so we can we can get access and purchase those plugs for you just let us know you can get them for any any geographic region and he actually another follow-up question it's a great question product-specific can you give a specific reason why you choose an MV x over 2 rugged transit duo's and if you want to give some some context over what specifically those are for anyone that's in here who's not um not aware that it'd be awesome to the MV x over those yeah yeah so the MV x is one of our new flagship products it's a 5g ready module device kind of based off the old HD 4 arm spec it has 4 it can have up to four active modules in there it can handle I believe 2.5 gigs of traffic and which is one of the reasons you go for the MPX and not to transit duo's which have much lower throughput capabilities but also it's one device that handles everything and is 5g ready once again a lot more powerful the the transit duals once another great product that we have using two of those just brings complexity to that to that deployment but also the throughput capabilities aren't there the mbx there's a lot more ports and capabilities on that mbx as well for wired connections SFP ports or whatnot so the it really to dig into that more we'd have to look at your exact application and what you're looking to do because at some point those at tsts may be a better solution but we just have to look in into it more got it Mike is there anything based on the kinds of questions that you're getting or anything that you'd like to to just make sure gets said before we let everyone go for the afternoon if not that's fine no I mean you know a lot of these questions are really directed at how the Peplink works with the multiple lands and different things and those are definitely all questions that we can dig in a much deeper on than I was able to today so this never hesitate to reach out pre-sales support or or just to discuss certain support solutions or applications we're happy to brainstorm so great questions and and each one is really really unique so we want to talk about the application specifically they answer them correct like so got it please reach out absolutely all right thank you everyone thank you so much for coming I haven't gotten any more questions so if you'd like to keep up with frontier and with Peplink feel free to follow us on social media we are on Twitter Facebook Linkedin and Instagram reach out to Mike reach out to our team with any questions any additional questions you might have especially as relates to to partnership with friends here becoming a Peplink reseller otherwise thank you so much for being here and I hope you have a great rest of your week thank you take care everybody", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-09-14T13:23:54Z", "channelId": "UC0gpFNJzbJU323tMR8miIdQ", "title": "Webinar |

which also shares quite a bit of componentry with the r2800 so one of the commonly asked questions we get is how do we get this power distribution board out of here okay and you've taken out your screws here here you may have removed this piece here there's a metal cover that goes over here there's also four screws okay down inside here that need to be removed once those are removed and you've removed the back plane cables that connect you can also remove the fan cables you don't have to you can just kind of get these out of the way there's fan trays by lifting them up and out of the way remove your backplane cables and what you'll notice is that with a good shove you'll be able to get this unseated from its eye holes okay you see down there where we've got the eye holes now this one's already seated unseated but once you push it backwards okay you're gonna have to there's some cables that need to come out of the way and kind of rock this board back and forth and there's some cables down underneath here that have to come out of the way to be very careful because there is a ribbon cable down here that runs along the side of the board and you can see as we're lifting it out this blue ribbon cable down here it actually runs all the way back around to the back of the chassis uh to where the power manager plugs in okay so we got to be very careful of that board that or that cable that we're not going to sever it or cut it during replacements as you rock the board outward there are slots specifically in the pcb that clear the little tabs and whatnot know if you can see that in there but there's right here there is a tab and right here there is a tab metal tabs that come out they're on both sides of the unit but you'll notice that the board is slotted properly to be able to get around those parts so you have to be very careful and rock it back and forth and you'll see now i'm standing on what would be the right hand of the server the server chassis itself if you're standing in front of the rack okay there's obviously no blades in this chassis because we're servicing it but you can see that it will come out this way okay then what you'd want to do is disconnect all of these cables disconnect this cable be very careful with that if you're not familiar with these types of ribbons cables and you can see that this is also dislodged when i moved the unit backward from the dislodge from its connector on the disk back plane so again this is the removal procedure for the r2600 our 2800 power distribution board being here again see the slots you can maybe see it good in this picture there's a slot in the board here to get around that tab there's a slot in the pcb here to get around those tabs see the slots so far every down every now and then down the board those are there by design to clear those parts of the chassis okay so be careful that you're not putting too much pressure on things you don't need to you just need to rock it back and forth clear the chassis the big end comes out first okay same with it putting it back in just do it in reverse on the way back in you'll notice there's some resistance it's this little cable okay the cables to the power pass-through board which is the board that's connected uh with the big copper connections okay you do not have to take that off you could if you wanted to but the whole unit rocks out when you're putting it back in just be sure you put your finger here so you can clear that little tab with the cable okay okay now that we have reinstalled the power distribution board and taken the power distribution board assembly and plugged it back into the disk back plane we have also reconnected all of the cables that we disconnected and you'll notice that there's some zip ties missing we like to cut them just to make it a little easier to remove the unit so make sure you keep some zip ties on you and add those zip ties back in where needed then you can put your last cover back on and call it a day and this is what it looks like when it's fully reassembled everything good to go and this unit can now be repopulated with its blades and put back into population with the rest of the servers so again remember frontier computer corp for all of your genuine hpe spare parts needs and self repair needs thank you for watching", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-09-11T19:40:03Z",

server 4100 and we have our longtime veteran tech Andrew figure here and he's going to go ahead and start the process now alright so got the server up in the cart took it out of the cab you could probably do this procedure the tray pulls out far enough while you're in the cab we're just doing this for ease of there's basically two screws on each side these screws hold the power tray out and just take that out have something right here is dumping those seeds in and then typically we have two screws these are already out but there's two screws right here that have to come out don't touch these guys yet you know that basically slides right out there's two tracks so it just pulls straight out we can kind of see the channel right here while you're putting it back in be mindful when you're you know lining these channels up to to make sure that you you feed it in and push it forward and here's your power supplies you got three of them starting from left power supply zero power supply one and power supply two I know we have a bad one right here so it came up and said that power supply one it failed so we're gonna be you know here's the here's the tricky part if you can kind of get a good shot in here you've got a bunch of cables going in here and that's the very reason there's not a lot of room here up until you move that tray back and the best thing to do is just start you know disconnecting just connecting these cables out just pull these out just like this you know if you're gonna replace all of them you can leave them in the harness it's not gonna go anywhere these kind of get a little bit tricky just kind of pinch and you know typical molex connectors instead of jamming your hand down and get your hand all jacked up this is where we pull this it's straightforward and if you look you'll see how it kind of fastens inside the the outside of the chassis and you can kind of tilt it forward rock it a little bit and it'll only come forward so much because of the harness but it gets it gives you enough space so you can actually get a good grip in some of these cables while you're disconnecting them and you just kind of there's so much pressure on these all you have to really do is just you know push forward this little clip on each of the power blocks and then just get them loose and you'll feel it click and you can almost hear it snap and they they can you can kind of pull it out from there there's one last one down here if you can kind of see catch this angle down down on the very bottom don't forget oh forget all these down in here just kind of this is a it gets pretty nasty so big deal just keep you can get kind of tight just get your other hand in there just kind of but the secret is just a make sure that clip is you know disconnected from the block itself you got to start opening up yourself more room on the side then just go ahead and you know they're all gonna come out Thanks all right we've got them all in plug we can take the whole assembly out just like this kind of pushed that wire harness back and then you can kind of tilt back this just slides right out now you have the whole power assembly they sit up on a area where you can start working out now this is where we start popping these these uh these trays out in this this whole thing this whole front is part of this tray here so the whole it doesn't come out you're just that's where the the front of the power supply is bolt into this this main power tree itself so we have these guys we're going to take out and then if you look at the top or come around the back here you'll see that there's actually room for um you know two on the back on the back tray it's not necessary obviously but you know you just gotta me kind of helps that longer screwdriver to of it that drill won't work does the angle yeah I can see you're starting to bleed they're handy this is a comedy I'm working on an FS over 4100 yep the edges are a little sharp back here they are and you know coming and coming around here these are quite stiff these aren't very friendly at all the power connector so probably drew a little bit on that one so right now these guys there's one free to free and they're all free I'm gonna take my screws dumping in here make sure that okay I already know that this one's bad so this was out of the picture so that's how I just slid them out they just popped right out and then you just pop the next batch in we've got a couple we're gonna test here we know this guy's good a couple now we need to test kind of place those in there slide them forward get them lined up here obviously power plug goes in the front all right here we go be careful when you're saw me take them out with a drill that's always faster but when you put them back in and I thought it's a good idea to do a hand tool that way I think these two if you look at the remember this is kind of cute you put this assembly back together that kind of you got to leave these two out because that's it whatever though kind of go ahead and put that in and make sure you get the screws on I put this one intentionally see sobbing what I'm talking about that screw will not the lid will not go on without that then with that screw it obviously so we're gonna back that out damas gonna be that what do we say we had you had that one funny because he's gonna kind of good now that we have our supplies inside the tray just gonna pick this guy up gently feed it inside push it in this is where you see this tab right here this is where that tab goes in these in this hole right here okay so when you're pushing it back home make sure you're not you want to sit that see the top sit down here make sure you're not rolling over these power cables when you push the tray back in so you got to be kind of mindful where that stuff is a lot of times you just tuck tuck the main harness underneath this shelf and then you can just go ahead keep in mind you know where that where that is and kind of go ahead and okay now here you're gonna try to hit the bottom ones first and just roll this out this is where patience comes in yeah this is where being tall comes in so you just kind of yeah my arms are going to be all over the place back here a lot of times if you want to best practices it's close each power-supply out because you can get in a hurry and forget this cable this is a sink you know the sync cable with the power so you just got out okay now we've got them all plugged in these special attention to this section right here you want to make sure that when you push that tray back you're not rolling back over those cables so as we push this we're keeping and we're paying attention to the wire harness we're also paying attention to the seating of this this clip inside the outside of the chassis so we just kind of roll it you see how this kind of goes inside here and then after that's all done and we verified that the cables are clear then we'll go ahead and push it home just like that and at this point just go ahead and put your screws back inside the side tray just got to line them up oh yeah or just a little good okay and for for video sake obviously you're gonna have these other screws and stuff like that in there you're gonna have them on yours and here we are with a lid switch interesting concept that alphas done with these is basically these these switched assemblies so it's a good idea to kind of inspect them and make sure that you know everything's intact and everything is there we really didn't incorporate any kind of any kind of magnet like some of the next generation but we are we're placing that inside the track and we're just gonna push it home just like that and that's that's about it so one okay you can't hear it but one thing Benny is you know kind of discovered and shared with myself over the years is the fact that these power supplies there's a real telltale sign if they're good or bad when heat when you apply the power I've got live 220 right here you know and great when you plug it in they make this distinct like real faint buzzing sound and typically if they don't make that sound then chances are you have a bad power supply and you have to read you this with whatever so we're gonna go ahead and power this up right now we're gonna apply it you can't really hear it cuz I I can hear it but I don't know if they'll be able to hear it on the radio okay I can hear that one that one already fired up and then we got this one so now the system should start to power on yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna exercise the power switch and then I'm gonna turn it back on and then we're gonna head on it you know how well they'll be able to see this but this is the system with its power on self test firing up right now okay now it's finished it's post-test or its power-on self-test also known as post and Andy's going to type a command here I probably show power and that should give us an output as to whether or not we were successful and now you can see as before you didn't see the video but it used to be power supply zero was bad and now you can see all three are good zero one and two it logged a previous event in the system log so we're just gonna go ahead go in there and as you can see you had power one power supply to failure whatever we're gonna clear these things that doesn't you know basically a little bit of housekeeping to show power again we're solid so you", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2012-03-13T15:28:07Z", "channelId": "UC0gpFNJzbJU323tMR8miIdQ", "title": "FrontierUS
