Please note that remote\\n\\ndevices will need this preshared key to access the Balance.\\n\\nDisabled Weak\\n\\nCiphers\\n\\nYou may click the \\xa0button to show in the Pre-shared key and enable this option.\\n\\nWhen checked, weak ciphers such as 3DES will be disabled.\\n\\nPlease note: Legacy and Android devices may not able to connect.\\n\\nConnection Security\\n\\nRefresh',\n",
