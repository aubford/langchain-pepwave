      "To resolve issues connecting to the UI of Verizon cell modems (MIFI 8800L and T1114) via a Peplink Balance 20, it is recommended to avoid overlapping network assignments to prevent connectivity issues. The MIFI 8800L should be configured to manage the 192.168.2.X subnet, while the T1114 should be set to 192.168.3.X. This configuration ensures clear management interface identification and proper routing. It is also important to note that the IP address reported in the Peplink router UI refers to the WAN interface of the Balance 20, not the modem's management interface, which can be accessed by checking the details for the default router.",
      "In a setup involving a Peplink Balance 20 router with two Verizon cell modems (MIFI 8800L via USB and T1114 via Ethernet), the user is unable to access the modems' UI through the wired network using the IP addresses reported by the Peplink router's Dashboard, although direct WiFi access is possible. The MIFI 8800L can be managed via USB, but the user notes that the information available from the WAN USB connection is less detailed compared to the Ethernet connection.",
      "The issue with accessing the Balance One router after a factory reset was resolved by identifying that the problem was related to IC2 and the WAN settings. This indicates that configuration settings in the InControl 2 (IC2) platform or WAN configuration may have affected the ability to log in to the router after the reset.",
      "In a scenario where a Peplink Balance is deployed in Drop-in Mode alongside an existing firewall, outside users can access hosted servers behind the firewall by utilizing NAT from the Peplink to the firewall's outside IP address. For the PeVPN tunnel to facilitate access between the head office (HO) and branch office (BO), static routes must be configured in the Peplink Balance for the HO internal networks, directing traffic to the firewall's outside interface. Additionally, the firewall should have NAT exemption policies in place to prevent NAT for traffic originating from the internal networks to the branch office LAN and vice versa.",
      "To deploy a Peplink Balance in drop-in mode with a /30 IP address configuration, the Shared IP option can be utilized. This option can be configured through the Drop In mode settings in the admin interface.",
      "To deploy a Peplink Balance in drop-in mode with a /30 IP address configuration, it is essential to ensure that the device is running the current firmware, as older firmware versions do not support this feature.",
      "After rebooting a Peplink router, if the status light turns red, it indicates a problem, and it should turn green upon successful reboot to its default IP address of 192.168.1.1. A connected PC should receive an IP address in the range of 192.168.1.X if the router is functioning correctly.",
      "When using a Peplink Balance 20 (Bal20) with two internet modems, if one connection goes down, the device should ideally switch to the other connection to maintain internet access. If this does not occur, it may indicate a configuration issue. Additionally, to access the Web Admin Interface at http://192.168.1.1, the device must be properly connected to the network, and the user should check the IP address assigned to their device to ensure it is on the same subnet as the Bal20.",
      "To troubleshoot a Peplink 20 that appears to be using a Vcenter web interface instead of the expected manual interface, a factory reset can be attempted by holding the pin reset button for 10-15 seconds while powered on. If this does not resolve the issue, it may indicate a hardware or software problem.",
      "To troubleshoot access issues with a Peplink 20, it is recommended to try accessing the device using a different PC at the IP address 192.168.1.1 and to ensure that the PC is receiving a DHCP address from the Peplink device.",
      "In a network topology where a Peplink device is used in conjunction with a firewall, the Peplink can handle NAT while the firewall manages filtering and controlling inbound and outbound traffic. For VPN tunnels that are configured on the firewall, it is necessary to use static NAT for the firewall's private IP. If there are multiple inbound services, it may be beneficial to retain the existing firewall configuration to facilitate the Peplink installation.",
      "The BR1 MK2 has been discontinued due to severe supply chain issues affecting its main System on Chip (SoC), which is linked to the global semiconductor chip shortage. A replacement product, the BR1 mini (HW3), is being launched and is expected to have a smooth transition for users migrating from the BR1 MK2, with most certifications either completed or in progress.",
      "The BR1 mini (HW3) is being launched as a replacement for the discontinued BR1 MK2. The BR1 mini operates at approximately 2W in normal operation, while the spec sheet for HW3 indicates a nominal power consumption of 13W, suggesting a significant increase in power usage that could impact applications such as small camper vans or RVs.",
      "The BR1 Mini HW3 has a similar Wi-Fi range to the BR1 MK2, with comparable transmission power levels. There have been no reported issues with the BR1 Mini HW3 when placed near a high power access point, although it is noted that the HW3 is built on a different platform, featuring a different CPU and Wi-Fi radio.",
      "To tether a phone or hotspot via USB to the WAN port of a Pepwave MAX Transit, any router that supports USB tethering can be used, ranging from inexpensive options to more costly devices.",
      "To tether a mobile phone to the WAN port of a Pepwave Max Transit, a modem is required to connect the USB phone on one end and route traffic to the WAN port on the other end. It is important to understand the differences between tethering and using a hotspot on mobile phones, as well as the implications for data plans. Additionally, managing Time To Live (TTL) settings can help prevent cellular ISPs from detecting VPN usage.",
      "To tether a phone or hotspot via USB to the WAN port of a Pepwave Max Transit, a specific small gateway device is needed. However, the suggested device does not work when connected to the Max Transit WAN port, indicating compatibility issues or limitations in functionality for this purpose.",
      "For connecting a phone or hotspot via USB to the WAN port of a Pepwave MAX Transit, a Google Ethernet Adapter can be used as it functions as both a charger and USB adapter. Additionally, an OTG hub, such as the one available on Amazon, can also be utilized for this purpose.",
      "Currently, there is no small and simple gateway device available that can be plugged into the Pepwave MAX Transit WAN port to tether a phone or hotspot via USB, aside from the USB MAX adapter. Any alternative would require additional components such as Linux and memory to convert to Ethernet. Future developments may include software that integrates cellular signal interfaces directly into devices like the Peplink Balance 20X, allowing for more seamless connectivity options.",
      "For connecting a phone or hotspot via USB to a Pepwave MAX Transit, the MAX adapter presents itself as a USB modem rather than a USB Ethernet device. An alternative solution is to use a MikroTik SXT LTE6 kit, which is a POE powered device that can be mounted outside and connects to the Peplink router via Ethernet. This device features a Cat6 modem and is effective in rural areas with distant towers, offering configurations for either bridging LTE directly or performing NAT. It is relatively inexpensive, with an MSRP of around $150 USD.",
      "The issue with the Max Transit Cat-18 router was resolved by replacing the unit, which was determined to be faulty. The new unit successfully worked with both AT&T and Verizon SIM cards, which are confirmed to be 5G compatible and functional with Max Transit devices. There is a suggestion that SIM cards may have restrictions based on the type of account, as indicated by previous tech support interactions with Verizon, which mentioned a potential requirement for a Business account for proper functionality in PepLink products.",
      "The Max Transit Cat-18 router was initially problematic, but after receiving a replacement unit, it successfully worked with both AT&T and Verizon SIM cards. AT&T confirmed that their SIM cards are 5G compatible, and these SIMs function correctly with Max Transit devices. The original issue involved difficulty obtaining an IP address with the Verizon SIM, which worked at the store but failed at home and further distances, suggesting potential tower limitations. The AT&T SIM card was not functional at either the AT&T store or the user's home, despite being in a location with acceptable RSSI levels around -70dBm.",
      "The Max Transit Cat-18 router is compatible with 5G SIM cards from AT&T, which can work with PepLink devices. If the router is stuck on 'Obtaining IP Address...' despite having a good signal strength, it is suggested to check the WAN quality in the IC2 interface to identify the band connected at a location where the router worked. Users can try unchecking all bands except the one that worked to see if it connects. Additionally, using a temporary Wi-Fi connection via tethering to a cell phone can facilitate opening a support ticket with PepLink for further assistance.",
      "The issue with the Max Transit Cat-18 router was resolved by replacing the faulty unit with a new one, which successfully worked with existing AT&T and Verizon SIM cards. The AT&T SIM cards were confirmed to be 5G compatible and are functional with Max Transit devices. There was a previous concern regarding the possibility of SIM cards being blocked for use in PepLink products, but the successful operation of the new unit suggests that the issue was not related to the SIM cards themselves.",
      "Peplink is expected to support band 71, which is part of T-Mobile's deployment of the 600 MHz spectrum, likely by late Q4.",
      "Peplink will soon support LTE-A Category 6 LTE. Additionally, Peplink routers have the capability to automatically switch cellular carriers when a new SIM card is inserted, provided the correct model is chosen based on the region (US or Europe/International) for the SIM card.",
      "Peplink is expected to have general availability of LTE-A Category 6 capabilities and automatic cellular carrier switching by January or the first quarter of the upcoming year. Currently, they are working with partners for early customer shipments.",
      "Peplink is expected to release LTE-A capabilities for most of its major product lines, including the BR1, Transit, HD2, and HD4 models. However, the conversation does not provide specific details about automatic cellular carrier switching or the method of manually flashing firmware for carrier changes.",
      "Currently, Peplink offers LTE-A models, but most of them do not support LTE-A Category 6, as their maximum throughput remains at 200 Mbps, which is not compliant with CAT. 6 specifications. There is no indication of when or if CAT. 6 models will be introduced in the future.",
      "Cradlepoint has introduced newer wireless technology earlier than some competitors, including AC wireless since 2014 and CAT 6 LTE-A modems since April 2016. Some Cradlepoint routers feature upgradeable modems, and their web UI is perceived as more modern. Additionally, Cradlepoint provides published pricing for all equipment, unlike some vendors that require a quote for products above a certain model. However, Cradlepoint lacks a community forum, which is seen as a disadvantage compared to other manufacturers like Pepwave.",
      "The Pepwave MAX On-the-Go (MOTG) is still a supported device and can be purchased. Alternatives include the Surf On the Go (SOTG) and the Surf SOHO, both of which require a USB modem. The SOTG has a similar form factor to the MOTG, while the SOHO offers more power and has a user interface that is the same as the MOTG.",
      "The BR1 Mini is experiencing issues obtaining an IP address despite having worked fine previously with the same setup. The user has attempted various troubleshooting steps including changing cellular settings between Sprint and generic, modifying the APN settings, updating the PRL, performing a full cellular reset, rebooting the device, and checking the SIM card status with Sprint support, which confirmed the SIM is in good standing. The user is unable to update the cellular modem firmware due to lack of connection and is considering using Wi-Fi as a LAN, although it may require a separate license.",
      "When a Pepwave BR1 Mini is stuck at obtaining IP, troubleshooting steps include changing cellular settings between the carrier and generic options, adjusting the APN settings, updating the PRL, performing a full cellular reset, and rebooting the device. If the SIM card works in another device, such as a hotspot, the issue may lie with the router or its connection to the cellular network rather than the SIM itself. Updating the cellular modem firmware may be necessary, but requires an internet connection, which is not available in this scenario.",
      "For exhibiting at events with multiple devices needing reliable internet, the B One 5G is recommended over the BR1 Mini 5G, as it can utilize a Peplink eSim for multi-carrier capability. The B One 5G can be managed locally without the need for Primecare, although opting out of Primecare results in losing features such as SpeedFusion, InControl, and InTouch. The effectiveness of the B One 5G with only the cellular connection active and client WiFi depends on the specific carrier and location."

    "query": "How does Drop-in Mode on Peplink Balance routers allow integration with existing firewalls and what are its technical limitations and configuration steps, as documented across multiple sources?",
    "answer": "Drop-in Mode on Peplink Balance routers enables seamless integration into an existing network by forwarding traffic transparently between LAN and WAN1 without performing IP address translation (NAT), allowing the existing firewall and network infrastructure to remain unchanged. In this mode, the firewall keeps its original gateway settings, and the Peplink router sits between the ISP modem and the firewall. If there are no spare public IP addresses available, the Peplink can share the existing WAN IP address to maintain transparency. Only one WAN port can be configured for Drop-in Mode, and High Availability (HA) is disabled if the LAN Bypass port is used as the WAN. The PPTP server is also automatically disabled when Drop-in Mode is active. Other WAN connections operate in NAT mode by default. Configuration involves connecting a computer to the Balance, accessing the web admin interface (usually at 192.168.1.1), setting the LAN IP, enabling Drop-in Mode, and configuring necessary parameters such as the default gateway and DNS servers. After saving settings and rebooting, routing should be verified before adding additional WANs. Drop-in Mode is especially useful for integrating load balancing and failover features without disrupting the current firewall or network setup, but it is limited to a single WAN in this mode and disables certain features such as PPTP server and HA.",

      "The issue with the MAX BR2 Wi-Fi as WAN configuration was resolved by switching from a 5 GHz connection to a 4.2 GHz connection. The local Wi-Fi AP was advertising 5 GHz but only functioning correctly on 4.2 GHz. Disabling the 5 GHz option on the BR2 and enabling the 4.2 GHz Wi-Fi as WAN allowed for reliable page loading. It was noted that Apple's Wi-Fi client automatically negotiates the Wi-Fi band, which is why another device connected to the local Wi-Fi AP did not experience the same issue.",
      "The Peplink Balance 310X does not support IP passthrough on WAN and cellular according to the firmware version 8.1.3 build 5162.",
      "The Peplink Balance 310X supports IP forwarding on the WAN side. To enable IP forwarding, users need to access the WAN connection settings and click on the question mark icon for guidance on the next steps.",
      "After installing firmware version 8.1.1 build 4994 on the Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3, users experienced issues with the 5 GHz Wi-Fi not broadcasting. One user noted that the router seemed to switch the 5 GHz channel but did not transmit, and there were also problems with the 2.4 GHz channels stopping transmission randomly. Reverting to firmware version 7.1.2 resolved these issues, allowing both 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz signals to function properly without interruptions. Users can switch between firmware versions using the active and other partitions on the router.",

    "query": "How does Peplink's SpeedFusion technology enable reliable live video streaming from remote locations, and what are the key setup considerations and best practices for maximizing bandwidth and minimizing latency in such deployments?",
    "answer": "Peplink's SpeedFusion technology enables reliable live video streaming from remote locations by bonding multiple WAN connections (such as 3G, 4G, LTE, ADSL, fiber, or satellite) into a single, higher-bandwidth, and more resilient link. This is accomplished by using two SpeedFusion-capable devices: one at the remote site (e.g., MAX On-The-Go, MAX 700, MAX HD2/HD4) and one at the headquarters or data center (e.g., Balance 210, Balance 380, FusionHub). The remote device aggregates the available WAN connections, sending video streams through a SpeedFusion VPN tunnel to the headquarters device, where the bonded traffic is reassembled and forwarded to the media server or streaming platform.\n\nTo maximize bandwidth and minimize latency, several best practices should be followed:\n- Use connections with similar latency and throughput for optimal bonding performance. Mixing high-latency (e.g., VSAT) and low-latency (e.g., fiber) links can reduce overall performance; in such cases, prioritize the faster/low-latency link and use the slower one as a failover.\n- WAN Smoothing can be enabled to send duplicate packets over multiple WANs, reducing the impact of packet loss and jitter, which is crucial for video streaming stability.\n- Employ Quality of Service (QoS) rules, prioritizing 'Audio Video Streaming' and RTP traffic on both the MAX and Balance devices to ensure video packets are transmitted with the highest priority.\n- The recommended hardware pairing is a MAX device (with built-in modems for reliability) at the remote site and a Balance 210 or higher at the headquarters. For cloud-based aggregation, FusionHub can be used on platforms like AWS.\n- Avoid USB dongles for extended bonding sessions, as they may be less reliable than built-in cellular modems with high-gain antennas.\n- Configure appropriate MTU sizes (e.g., 1300 for WAN, 1200 for UDP) to prevent packet fragmentation and loss.\n- The achievable bonded bandwidth is typically about 90% of the combined total, after accounting for VPN overhead.\n- For event streaming, pre-configure the headquarters router for automatic operation, minimizing the need for on-site technical staff.\n- Monitor the real-time status of each WAN link (bandwidth, latency, packet loss) to dynamically adjust routing and maintain optimal streaming quality.\n- Consider local regulations and available cellular bands; upcoming support for Cat6 LTE and wider channel widths can further improve bonding performance.\n- For large-scale or overseas deployments, use a hub-and-spoke topology with a Balance router as a VPN concentrator or FusionHub in the cloud.\n\nBy following these practices, Peplink's SpeedFusion technology delivers robust, high-bandwidth, low-latency video streaming from virtually any remote location.",

      "Peplink SpeedFusion technology supports various types of connections including Metro-E, leased lines, MPLS, private backhaul, dark fiber, wireless point-to-point, and microwave links at both Layer 2 and Layer 3. This allows for the bonding of different types of links for improved network performance and reliability.",
      "The antenna in question has a 1.25 inch pipe thread with a TPI of 11, although the exact length of the thread is not specified. A flat ground plane positioned immediately below the antenna can enhance the antenna's peak gain. Testing has shown that an aluminum ground plane is effective for this purpose. The size of the ground plane should ideally be 1.5 times the diameter of the antenna for optimal performance, as indicated in the gain and efficiency graphs available in the MB-42G datasheet.",
      "For a customer using a MAX-HD4-MBX-LTEA-K-T, SpeedFusion Cloud offers session reliability and bandwidth bonding without requiring additional Peplink hardware at the other end. If SpeedFusion Cloud is not used, a virtual or hardware appliance is necessary to enable bonding; otherwise, only load balancing can be utilized.

    "query": "How can a technician optimize bonded throughput using Peplink SpeedFusion, especially when combining links with different bandwidths and latencies, and what factors or configuration considerations from multiple documents affect the achievable throughput?",
    "answer": "To optimize bonded throughput using Peplink SpeedFusion, a technician must consider both the quality and configuration of WAN links. The achievable bonded throughput is limited by several factors: (1) the upload speed at the remote site, since SpeedFusion tunnels require symmetrical bandwidth for optimal results; (2) the overhead introduced by SpeedFusion bonding, which can be 15\u201330%, reducing the theoretical maximum throughput; (3) the lowest upload speed among all links, which acts as a bottleneck for download speeds at the receiving end; (4) the latency and packet loss characteristics of each link, as large differences (e.g., more than 150 ms) can degrade performance and prevent effective bonding; (5) the requirement that the slowest link should have at least 15% of the bandwidth of the fastest link for optimal results; (6) the use of features like WAN Smoothing and Forward Error Correction, which improve reliability but further reduce available bandwidth due to additional overhead; (7) the router models used, as each Peplink device has a maximum SpeedFusion throughput capability; and (8) the configuration of outbound policies, which can prioritize traffic and affect how bandwidth is distributed. To maximize throughput, all links should have low latency (preferably under 1000 ms), minimal packet loss, and comparable speeds. Technicians should monitor SpeedFusion graphs, adjust policies, and avoid including unstable links in the bonded group. For very high speeds, ensure both endpoints support the necessary encrypted throughput. Finally, always account for SpeedFusion overhead when estimating real-world throughput.",

      "The IMEI number for the Pepwave Max BR1 mini LTEA can be found through InControl2 by clicking on details under the cellular section, as well as directly in the web admin interface under the cellular details on the main page.",
      "To troubleshoot a non-working Verizon SIM card in a Pepwave BR1 mini, it is suggested to check the APN settings, which should default to vzwinternet for Verizon. If the router is stuck on obtaining IP, rebooting the entire unit may resolve the issue, as it did for another user who experienced a similar problem with their AT&T connection. Additionally, saving a diagnostic log can be helpful for further support from Peplink.",
      "When experiencing issues with a Pepwave Max Transit Duo obtaining an IP address while using an AT&T SIM in Canada, it is important to ensure that data roaming is enabled on the device. If the issue persists, it may be related to a provisioning problem with the carrier, and contacting AT&T for assistance is recommended.",
      "If a Pepwave device is stuck on 'obtaining IP address' after working for several months with a UK Contract SIM, it is advisable to troubleshoot by testing the device in a different location. This may help determine if the issue is related to the carrier's network changes, such as moving to new bands that are not supported by the hardware. Checking APN settings and ensuring they are correctly configured is also important.",
      "When troubleshooting a Pepwave device that is unable to obtain an IP address with a UK Contract SIM, it is advisable to test the SIM in another known working device to confirm its functionality. In the UK, while network operators generally do not impose strict limitations on SIM usage in Pepwave devices, it has been observed that PAYG and phone SIMs may face restrictions compared to SIMs designated for mobile broadband, particularly when using features like SpeedFusion.",
      "For optimal mounting of the Pepwave MAX BR1 Pro 5G in an RV, it is suggested that the WiFi antennas should be oriented upwards. The user has roof-mounted Panorama antennas, with one serving as the main antenna for WiFi WAN and the other providing client WiFi, with VLAN bridging between them to extend the client-side range.",
      "To manage DHCP lease time effectively on a Surf SOHO MK3, it is suggested to assign static IP addresses to devices instead of relying on a lease time of seven days. This approach can help reduce log clutter caused by frequent lease renewals from devices like the Dish Hopper 3.",
      "The device is compatible with both AT&T and Verizon networks, requiring only a SIM card and a data plan for operation.",
      "IP Passthrough is a feature supported only in a single cellular model and is not available in the BR2 Pro. This information has been updated to reflect the correct feature availability.",
      "The Pepwave BR1 Mini routers, particularly the Core model, have been reported to experience issues with SIM detection, leading to intermittent connectivity problems. Users have noted that these issues persist despite extensive troubleshooting, including swapping antennas, cables, routers, and SIMs, as well as re-provisioning SIMs with the carrier. In contrast, other models like the full-size MAX-BR1 have shown much higher reliability. There is a suggestion that there may have been bad batches of the Mini and Mini Core models, and users express a desire for better troubleshooting tools for end users, especially for devices that become unresponsive after firmware updates.",
      "The Pepwave MAX BR1 ENT is suitable for smaller events with a recommended user count of 25 to 150 devices, making it potentially effective for events with up to 150 attendees. For larger events with 250 to 500 users, the HD4 model in the multi-cellular devices section may be a better option. The specifications for WiFi range and user capacity should be considered when selecting a device, and consulting with a Peplink Certified Partner can provide tailored solutions for specific event needs.",
      "The Max BR1 device has a limitation on the number of MAC filter entries it can support, likely being one of the common maximum values such as 256, 512, or 1024 entries. The exact number is not specified, but it is not unlimited.",
      "To troubleshoot connectivity issues with a MAX BR1 Pro 5G on the Verizon network, it is essential to ensure that the SIM card plan is compatible with the device, as Verizon may lock the SIM's ICCID to the IMEI of the previous device (like a VZW 5G Gateway cube). If the SIM card is locked, it may not work in the BR1 Pro 5G. Users are advised to contact the partner from whom the device was purchased for support, as Peplink's policy assigns first-tier tech support to the selling partner. Additionally, searching forums for similar experiences can provide insights, as connectivity issues with Verizon have been discussed frequently, and visiting a Verizon store may also be necessary for resolution.",
      "The MAX BR1 Pro 5G is experiencing connectivity issues with the Verizon network despite the SIM card being active and recognized by Verizon. The device shows a green blinking light for Cellular and remains in a 'Connecting...' state without establishing a connection. The IMEI number of the SIM card is visible on the Peplink account, indicating that the device is communicating with the network at some level. Further investigation into the ICCID with Verizon and potential support from the vendor may be necessary to resolve the issue.",
      "The MAX BR1 Pro 5G device is experiencing connectivity issues with the Verizon network despite the SIM card being active and recognized by the network. The device shows a green blinking light for Cellular and remains in a 'Connecting...' state, indicating it is unable to establish a connection. The IMEI number of the SIM card is visible in the Peplink account, suggesting that the device is communicating with the Peplink system, but it is not successfully connecting to the Verizon network. Resellers may have access to wireless network performance tools and tier 3 engineers to assist with troubleshooting connectivity issues.",
      "When experiencing connectivity issues with a MAX BR1 Pro 5G on the VZW network, it is important to verify that the ICCID is properly tied to the IMEI number. Although the VZW customer service indicated that the APN does not need to be changed and that the MAX is a certified device, confirming these details can help resolve connectivity problems. Additionally, visiting a VZW corporate store may provide further assistance in troubleshooting the issue.",
      "The MAX-BR1-MINI-LTE-US has been discontinued, and the recommended replacement is the MAX-BR1-MINI-LTE-US-T-PRM model. Whether the -T-PRM model serves as a drop-in replacement depends on the configuration of the original device, and there is uncertainty regarding the compatibility of configuration files between the two models.",
      "The MAX BR1 Mini \"Core\" units and non-core MAX BR1 Mini units may utilize different cellular modules, which can result in variations in cellular firmware versions. Users can verify the specific cellular module at the device level to confirm this difference.",
      "To troubleshoot connectivity issues with an AT&T SIM card in a Pepwave device, it is important to verify that the plan is active and that the Access Point Name (APN) is set to 'broadband'. Ensuring that the device is running the latest firmware is also crucial.

      "SpeedFusion Connect is Peplink's public bonding service that allows for the management of connections through a router or the SpeedFusion Connect app. It supports client and relay modes, enabling users to stream content from their home network while traveling. Users can configure multiple locations for outbound access and create sub-tunnels with features like WAN smoothing and forward error correction. The system allows for the management of LAN settings and static routes, and it can utilize a home static IP address when in relay mode. Health checks can be configured to monitor connection quality, and bandwidth usage can be tracked with notifications for utilization thresholds. The router supports various WAN connection methods and can enable IP forwarding for public IP addresses, facilitating complex networking setups.",
      "When connecting a Peplink SOHO router directly to a Verizon Fios ONT, issues may arise due to the need for authentication and administrative tasks typically handled by the Fios router. The Fios router may be performing essential functions such as 802.1x authentication and firmware updates. It is recommended to keep the carrier-provided gateway in place and configure it to IP-passthrough mode to avoid connection issues while allowing the Peplink router to manage the network effectively. This setup can facilitate inbound connections, such as SpeedFusion tunnels, without losing connectivity.",
      "SpeedFusion requires a VPN connection because standard internet connections do not support features like hot failover, WAN smoothing, or bonding in a conventional manner. Peplink's implementation of SpeedFusion utilizes a VPN, which is not primarily for security but to facilitate these advanced features. Additionally, the VPN used for SpeedFusion can be configured to operate without encryption by default to reduce CPU overhead.",
      "SpeedFusion requires a VPN tunnel to route traffic to a server endpoint, such as a SpeedFusion Cloud (SFC) or another SpeedFusion-enabled device, where the data is processed and combined. Each WAN connection builds a VPN tunnel to the SpeedFusion endpoint. However, if encryption is not needed, it is possible to disable the encryption in the SpeedFusion configuration, which can reduce the bandwidth overhead associated with the VPN.",
      "SpeedFusion technology can be utilized with Layer-2 connections, such as Metro-E connections, allowing for the bonding of links including a Metro-E connection and a leased-line/internet connection. This enables communication between sites within the same broadcast domain, as long as the IP addresses are properly configured.",
      "For a work from home setup requiring multiple WAN connections, the Peplink Balance 20X is recommended as a suitable router. It features a built-in CAT4 modem and the option to add a pluggable CAT12 modem module for higher LTE speeds. The router supports one Ethernet WAN port and a USB WAN for additional connectivity. Utilizing SpeedFusion cloud profiles allows for directing VoIP and Zoom traffic through a bonded tunnel while managing other internet usage through the main WAN. Additionally, the Balance 20X includes a built-in AP controller for managing access points, with centralized management available through an inControl2 subscription included in the prime care license for the first year.",
      "For a work from home setup requiring reliable internet for VoIP and video calls, a Peplink Balance 20X is a suitable option, particularly for bonding multiple WAN connections such as Starlink, DSL, and AT&T LTE. The Balance 30 LTE and 580X are also considered, with the latter allowing for extensive WAN options including DSL, Starlink, and multiple cellular connections. The use of HD2 dome antennas is suggested for improved cellular signal, especially when mounted on the roof, to enhance connectivity and performance.",
      "For setting up a home office network with multiple users and bandwidth-heavy activities, the Balance 20X router is a strong candidate, particularly if integrated cellular options are needed. The Balance One and Balance Two are also viable options depending on specific requirements such as WAN bandwidth needs and integrated access points. The Balance 20X supports up to 1Gbps WAN speeds, while the Balance One is limited to 900Mbps and the Balance Two has a higher cost. SpeedFusion Cloud is capped at 100Mbps, which may not provide additional bandwidth benefits depending on ISP services, but setting up a SpeedFusion Solo Hub can allow for multi-WAN bonded internet access. It is advisable to consider future-proofing options and the reliability of the USB port for WAN connections.",
      "It is possible to combine two different speeds of internet connections in Peplink devices using load balancing or SpeedFusion bonding. However, the combined speed will not equal the sum of the two connections (e.g., 80 Mbps) for a single stream due to overhead involved in the process.",
      "When using SpeedFusion Cloud with a Peplink Balance One or Balance One Core, a SpeedFusion license is not required. However, if one intends to use SpeedFusion to connect to another Peplink device or FusionHub, then the SpeedFusion Bonding License Key would be necessary.",
      "When using a Peplink Balance One or Balance One Core with SpeedFusion Cloud, the additional SpeedFusion Bonding License Key is not required. Users can purchase bandwidth top-up packs for SpeedFusion Cloud without needing the bonding license. Additionally, a care plan such as EssentialCare may include a package of 500GB/100Mbps for SpeedFusion Cloud, which can be beneficial for users looking to bond multiple DSL connections.",
      "To combine two 1GB FIOS connections for increased bandwidth to a PC network, using a Peplink router with outbound policy is recommended. This allows traffic to be directed over both WAN connections based on set criteria, such as a least used policy, which sends new sessions over the WAN connection with the most available bandwidth. For scenarios with multiple sessions, SpeedFusion bonding can be utilized to allow a single session to use the combined bandwidth, though it incurs an overhead of approximately 20%.",
      "To utilize SpeedFusion with a Balance One device, a SpeedFusion license is required on each end of the connection, costing $900 each. The Balance One has two WAN ports by default, and to add a third WAN port, a software upgrade (BPL-ONE-LC-5WAN) is available for $100. The Balance One comes with two PepVPN licenses, which are determined by the number of Balance devices to connect rather than the number of WAN ports. If more than two devices need to be connected, an additional PepVPN license may be necessary, with an upgrade option available for up to five simultaneous connections.",
      "Using SpeedFusion or IPSEC VPN to connect two Peplink 380 devices at separate sites can provide an unbreakable connection if one of the WAN links goes down, ensuring that sessions remain established. Additionally, SpeedFusion allows for bonding multiple WAN links, enabling aggregate bandwidth between the sites.",
      "To aggregate WAN and cellular connections using a Peplink Balance 30 LTE with SpeedFusion Cloud, it is possible to bond the two links, although the success of this bonding depends on the quality of the connections. SpeedFusion is a VPN bonding technology that incurs overhead from additional headers, which can reduce the effective bandwidth. The theoretical bonded bandwidth calculation accounts for this overhead, estimating a combined throughput of approximately 32 Mbps under ideal conditions. Testing tools such as SpeedFusion graphs and speed tests can help diagnose performance issues, with packet loss being a significant factor affecting bandwidth performance.",
      "SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding can be used to combine the bandwidth of multiple WAN links, allowing one device behind the Peplink router to utilize the combined bandwidth of both connections, minus the bonding overhead. This technology can effectively increase overall throughput, as demonstrated by a user who combined two 15/1 DSL links to achieve a 25/1.5 connection, resulting in a noticeable improvement in performance.",
      "To combine a fiber DSL connection with a cable connection at packet level, a Peplink multi-WAN Balance router with a SpeedFusion license is necessary. This setup allows for channel bonding, effectively increasing download and upload speeds by aggregating the bandwidth from both connections. It is important to ensure that the SpeedFusion license is included with the router or accounted for in the overall cost, as it can be expensive if purchased separately. Additionally, the router should be compatible with the existing network setup to avoid issues like double NAT, which can affect device connectivity and security.",
      "To combine a fiber DSL connection with a cable connection for increased bandwidth, load balancing can be utilized for high bandwidth traffic, providing session level failover between WAN links. SpeedFusion should be reserved for real-time traffic sensitive to packet loss or latency, such as VoIP. Recommended devices for this setup include the Pepwave Balance Two or the SDX for future 5G integration.",
      "To combine two high-speed internet connections effectively, such as a fiber DSL line and a cable connection, bonding is necessary to create a virtual single pipe that aggregates the bandwidth of both connections. The Peplink Balance 2500 and the EPX modular chassis with appropriate expansion cards are capable of supporting over 800Mbps of bonded throughput. However, bonding can be expensive and requires a separate connection point to the internet. Alternatively, Peplink devices can utilize outbound policy for WAN load balancing, allowing for balanced use of both WAN connections for outbound traffic, while inbound traffic would typically be directed to one WAN unless DNS configurations are employed to manage inbound traffic across both connections. This setup can provide failover capabilities, ensuring continuity if one connection fails.",
      "To disable drop-in mode on a Peplink 210 balancer device, navigate to Network > LAN > Drop-In Mode Settings. This may help resolve issues related to internet access after saving configurations, as drop-in mode can affect routing behavior.",
      "The Balance One Core device does not support SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding without an optional license key (SKU: BPL-ONE-LC-SF). To bond two WAN connections, a SpeedFusion VPN tunnel must be established to a second Peplink device with SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding enabled or a FusionHub appliance. For instance, to bond two 30 Mbps WAN connections, a minimum WAN connection of 60 Mbps is required at the datacenter side.",
      "SpeedFusion technology uses the same number of ports for establishing connections as older bonding methods, meaning that for N WANs at site A and N WANs at site B, the total number of ports opened and established will be N x N. Additionally, SpeedFusion supports bonding two WANs that are on the same subnet, allowing for effective load sharing without requiring different subnets for each WAN connection.",
      "To improve upload and download speeds for data processing, utilizing a Peplink Balance 380 or higher can be beneficial. By implementing SpeedFusion technology, two ISP links can be bonded, allowing for seamless file transfers that utilize the combined bandwidth of both connections. If the second ISP performs comparably to the existing one, file transfer times could be significantly reduced, potentially halving the duration for uploads and downloads.",

      "SpeedFusion technology allows for the combination of multiple WAN connections to enhance internet speed and reliability. It operates on a hierarchy where PepVPN serves as the foundation, followed by SpeedFusion Hot Failover and then SpeedFusion Bonding. Traffic management approaches can be applied on top of bonding, including options such as Bonding, Lowest Latency, Weighted Round Robin, and Overflow. WAN Smoothing can be enabled to duplicate packets for reduced packet loss, consuming additional bandwidth. If WAN Smoothing is set to maximum, the SpeedFusion distribution algorithm is ignored, but at lower levels, duplicate packets are distributed according to the selected traffic distribution rules. In scenarios where the Lowest Latency distribution is used, SpeedFusion continuously selects the WAN with the lowest latency for outbound packets, adjusting as network conditions change.",
      "SpeedFusion technology allows the bonding of multiple WAN connections to achieve higher speeds and reliability. Traffic control algorithms can prioritize connections based on latency, while smoothing helps reduce packet loss by utilizing different connections to ensure a stable experience. However, if less stable connections are included in the mix, they may negatively affect overall performance, regardless of the Peplink technology. The persistence feature is useful for specific applications, but it may lead to load balancing rather than true bonding. The combination of these features should be carefully configured to achieve a reliable connection, especially for applications sensitive to packet loss, such as cloud software.",

    "query": "How does Peplink SpeedFusion technology enable packet-level bonding of multiple WAN connections for increased bandwidth and reliability, what are the key requirements and limitations for such bonding, and how do device models, licensing, and configuration (including encryption, cloud endpoints, and outbound policies) affect achievable throughput and use cases?",
    "answer": "Peplink SpeedFusion enables packet-level bonding by creating a VPN tunnel between two Peplink endpoints (physical routers or FusionHub virtual appliances). This tunnel splits and distributes traffic at the packet level across multiple WAN links, reassembling it at the remote end, thus aggregating bandwidth, providing seamless failover, and enhancing reliability. To implement SpeedFusion bonding, two compatible endpoints are required\u2014either two Peplink routers or a router and a FusionHub instance\u2014with sufficient bandwidth and public IP (only the hub needs a public IP). Device model selection is crucial, as each has rated SpeedFusion throughput limits (e.g., Balance 210: 80\u2013150 Mbps; 20X: 100 Mbps; 310X: 600 Mbps; 580X: 800 Mbps). Licensing is also important: some models require a SpeedFusion license (e.g., Balance One), while others include it (e.g., 20X with PrimeCare). SpeedFusion can be used with Peplink\u2019s SpeedFusion Cloud (limited to 100\u2013200 Mbps) or a self-hosted FusionHub (no artificial cap, only device limits). Encryption can be enabled or disabled; disabling it increases throughput by reducing overhead. Bandwidth overhead for bonding is typically 15\u201330%. Outbound policies control which traffic uses SpeedFusion, allowing for application-specific routing (e.g., VoIP, video calls). Features like WAN smoothing and Forward Error Correction further enhance reliability but increase bandwidth consumption. SpeedFusion supports both Layer 2 and Layer 3 connections and can bond links of different types and ISPs, provided their latency and bandwidth differences are within recommended parameters. True aggregation of bandwidth for a single session is only possible with SpeedFusion; standard load balancing distributes sessions but does not combine bandwidth for one flow. Use cases include remote work, VoIP, video streaming, failover, and applications requiring high availability and bandwidth. Limitations include device throughput caps, licensing costs, the need for two endpoints, and the overhead introduced by the bonding process and optional features. Proper configuration, especially of outbound policies and endpoint placement (cloud vs. physical), is essential for maximizing benefits and avoiding double NAT or performance bottlenecks.",

    "query": "When deploying a Peplink router to bond Starlink and cellular connections for reliable Zoom and Teams calls in a mobile or rural environment, what advanced SpeedFusion configuration techniques and settings should a technician consider to maximize performance, minimize interruptions, and efficiently manage bandwidth, especially when using SpeedFusion Cloud or FusionHub?",
    "answer": "To maximize performance and minimize interruptions when bonding Starlink and cellular connections with a Peplink router for real-time applications like Zoom and Teams, technicians should employ several advanced SpeedFusion techniques and settings. First, use SpeedFusion Bonding to aggregate both Starlink and cellular WANs, which enhances bandwidth and provides seamless failover. Enable WAN smoothing to duplicate packets across both connections, reducing packet loss and jitter\u2014critical for real-time voice and video\u2014but be aware it increases bandwidth consumption. For one-way audio/video, Forward Error Correction (FEC) can be used instead of full smoothing to minimize overhead while maintaining reliability. Dynamic Weighted Bonding (DWB) should be configured to optimize throughput by dynamically allocating traffic based on current link quality and latency, which is particularly effective when combining links with differing performance profiles like Starlink and LTE/5G. Outbound policies must be set to prioritize critical traffic (such as Zoom and Teams) through the SpeedFusion tunnel, while less critical or bulk traffic can be routed outside the tunnel to conserve bonded bandwidth and minimize data costs. When using SpeedFusion Cloud or FusionHub, ensure the router model and subscription/license can handle the expected throughput and data usage. Monitor connection health and adjust MTU and health check settings to account for Starlink\u2019s unique characteristics. Regularly review SpeedFusion statistics and use tools like WAN Analyzer to identify bottlenecks or packet loss. Finally, keep firmware updated to benefit from the latest SpeedFusion enhancements, such as improved DWB and application-based routing, which further refine bandwidth allocation and failover response.",

      "For high availability (HA) configurations with Peplink Balance 710 devices, using an active/active setup is recommended over an active/passive VRRP HA-pair due to the slow failover times associated with VRRP, which can exceed 30 seconds. In cases where compliance requires an active/passive configuration, VRRP may still be used, but it is considered cumbersome and outdated compared to active/active configurations that allow for faster failover and better resource utilization.",
      "Peplink's high availability (HA) feature operates on a master/slave architecture, where one router is designated as the master and the other as a backup. The backup router remains inactive while the master is operational, only becoming active if the master fails. This implementation does not support a peer-to-peer relationship where both routers can independently manage their own WANs and VLANs while providing backup for each other. The HA configuration requires synchronization of settings between the master and slave, which is optional but necessary for the slave to be prepared for activation in case of a master failure. If synchronization is not enabled, the slave must be manually configured to match the master.",
      "To configure two Peplink Balance 20X routers for redundancy, utilize the built-in High Availability (HA) features by designating one router as the master and the other as the slave, enabling configuration synchronization. Assign a virtual IP (VIP) to facilitate seamless failover, and connect a LAN port from one router to a LAN port on the other. For WAN connections, ensure symmetric configuration for upstream options, and if all four WANs need to be utilized simultaneously, consider using VLANs and policy routing, although this may require additional hardware or a virtual WAN license due to the limitations of the 20X's Ethernet WAN ports.",
      "In a high availability (HA) setup using Peplink Balance routers in NAT mode, VRRP is utilized for WAN as well as LAN configurations. When properly configured, VRRP allows for the transfer of WAN addresses from the master router to the slave router in the event of a failure. This means that only one public IP address is needed for the HA setup, as the slave router will take over the master router's public IP address upon failure, rather than requiring multiple public IP addresses for each router.",
      "In a high availability (HA) setup for Peplink Balance routers in NAT mode, the LAN configuration requires a Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) setup with a virtual IP (VIP) for the master and slave units. For the WAN configuration, two options are presented. Option 1 requires three VRRP groups: one for the LAN and one for each ISP, necessitating a total of six public IP addresses. Option 2 suggests a simpler configuration with only two public IP addresses, where the master unit handles both WAN connections and the slave unit takes over the WAN IP address upon failover. The WAN setup involves two ISPs, each with its own subnet and gateway.",
      "In a High Availability (HA) setup using two Peplink Balance 380 routers configured with VRRP, issues may arise when both routers compete for the master role, particularly during internet connectivity loss. This can lead to network downtime as the routers transition between master and slave roles. The VRRP protocol relies on periodic advertisement packets sent from the master device to maintain the master-slave relationship. If both routers remain connected to the LAN and are aware of each other's WAN connectivity, conflicts over the master role can occur, especially if one router fails to recognize the recovery of the other after a power cycle. Proper diagnostics and physical connection details are crucial for troubleshooting these issues effectively.",
      "Pepwave routers support high availability configurations using the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) as defined in RFC 3768, allowing for redundancy and failover in a master-slave arrangement. In this configuration, two Pepwave routers communicate over the LAN using VRRP, broadcasting heartbeat signals at a frequency of one per second. If the master router fails to send a heartbeat signal for 3 seconds or longer, the slave router activates, initiates WAN connections, and binds to a preconfigured LAN IP address. Upon recovery, the master router will regain its active status by default.",

The use of OSPF routes and path costs can also influence the failover time and network performance.",
      "The high availability feature of the Peplink Balance 20X can cause issues with cable modems, particularly those from Comcast, due to the changing of the Ethernet MAC address on the WAN port. This can lead to the modem becoming unresponsive, as it is sensitive to MAC address changes. The MAC address used during high availability is an unassigned IANA MAC address (00:00:5e:01:01:fa), which is not appropriate for this function. The expected virtual MAC address for VRRP should be 00:00:5e:00:01:fa. When high availability is enabled, the WAN port may show a private IP address instead of the public IP, and the WAN status may indicate down due to DNS test failures, suggesting that the modem is not passing traffic from the router. Packet captures during this time may yield unexpected results, such as capturing LAN traffic instead of WAN traffic.",

    "query": "How does failover operate in a Peplink High Availability (HA) configuration using VRRP, and what are the required configuration steps and considerations to ensure seamless LAN and WAN failover across models such as Balance, MAX, and BR1 devices?",
    "answer": "Failover in a Peplink High Availability (HA) configuration using VRRP operates by designating two routers as master and slave (or active-standby). The master handles all traffic, while the slave monitors the master via periodic VRRP advertisement packets (heartbeat). If the slave does not receive these packets within a defined interval (typically 3\u201315 seconds), it takes over the master\u2019s responsibilities, activating its WAN interfaces and binding to the shared virtual IP (VIP) used as the default gateway for LAN devices. Once the original master recovers, it can resume its role.\n\nTo ensure seamless failover, both devices must be on the same subnet and use the same unique HA group identifier. The configuration involves assigning individual LAN IP addresses to each device, setting a shared VIP as the LAN default gateway, and enabling Configuration Sync on the slave to automatically mirror settings from the master at intervals (usually every 5 minutes), or manually syncing configurations. In NAT mode, the VIP must be set as the default gateway for all LAN clients; in Drop-in mode, no additional configuration is required for LAN hosts. Both devices must be connected to the Internet in the same mode (NAT or Drop-in) for proper operation. Using separate Ethernet switches is recommended to prevent a single point of failure. Failover time is typically 10\u201315 seconds, but can be longer on some models or with VRRP limitations. These principles apply across Peplink Balance, MAX, and BR1 devices, with firmware and model-specific nuances (e.g., BR1 supports HA from Firmware 7).",

      "When experiencing connectivity issues with a Pepwave BR2 using Starlink antennas, one possible solution is to power cycle the Starlink unit if it shows 'Connecting...' without establishing a connection. Additionally, it is recommended to connect the BR2 directly to the Starlink dish rather than using the Starlink router and ethernet dongle, as this may affect connectivity.",
      "To access the factory settings of a Pepwave device after a reset, the default WiFi password can be found by using the last 8 digits of the LAN MAC address, which is located on the silver label on the bottom of the device. The password should be entered without colons.",
      "In the context of a Pepwave 20X device using Dynamic Weighted Bonding (DWB), it has been observed that even without WAN Smoothing configured, the device shows a consistent low rate of packets being sent for WAN smoothing in the detailed graphs. This behavior is attributed to TCP ACK optimization, which is a feature of DWB. In version 8.2.0, users will have the option to disable TCP ACK optimization if desired.",
      "When selecting an external antenna for the Pepwave 310 5G, users must decide between omni-directional and directional antennas. Directional antennas require aiming at the cell tower for optimal performance. Additionally, when mounting an antenna on a mast, considerations for lightning protection should be taken into account. Users should also research the MHz and dB loss per foot for the antenna wire they plan to use, as this can affect signal quality.",
      "When using SpeedFusion Cloud with a Pepwave MBX and multiple tunnels, the Default tunnel routes traffic through cellular connections with ISP-provided IP addresses, which may not be subject to Netflix's proxy filter black-list. In contrast, traffic routed through the FEC tunnel may be blocked by Netflix due to the different break-out IP addresses provided by the SpeedFusion Cloud service. This distinction can affect the ability to stream content on platforms like Netflix when using specific tunnels.",
      "The availability of LTE-A on a Pepwave MAX BR1Mk2 can be influenced by the SIM card or data plan being used. If the SIM card is part of a specific tablet plan, it may not support LTE-A, which could explain why only LTE is being observed in certain locations. Additionally, issues with connectivity may arise if the SIM card is not functioning properly or if there are network restrictions in place, such as AT&T auditing IMEIs.",
      "To regain access to a Pepwave Max BR1 after being locked out due to a username and password change, perform a hardware reset by holding the reset button for 20 seconds. After resetting, access the device by visiting http://192.168.50.1 on a connected device.",
      "The Balance MediaFast family of products supports 7 load balancing algorithms, while the BALANCE family supports 8. The missing algorithm is likely 'fastest response time', which was added most recently. However, it is also possible that the MediaFast reference and datasheets are outdated.",
      "The firmware version 3.6 does not include the WDS option in the AP tab, as noted in the release notes for that specific version. Users should be aware of this limitation when skipping firmware versions during updates.",
      "The Peplink Balance 20 has a throughput speed that can vary between 100 Mbps and 150 Mbps, which may depend on factors such as firmware or hardware configurations. To verify the actual throughput speed, it is recommended to test the connection directly to the WAN using a PC, rather than through a gigabit rated switch.",
      "The issue with the Pepwave Sure SOHO MK3's 2.4GHz SSID not allowing certain clients to connect after a period of time may be related to the WiFi connection between the affected clients and the router. While the 2.4GHz SSID is still visible, affected clients cannot connect to it after disconnection, although it reappears after some time. The problem does not affect all wireless clients simultaneously, suggesting it may not be a widespread issue with the MK3's WiFi functionality. Signal strength measurements of the affected clients may provide further insight into the problem.",
      "The Pepwave BR1 family of routers can function as a Wi-Fi Access Point (AP), Wi-Fi client, and bridge, with the ability to switch among these functions through configuration settings. Specific features can be found on the product specification page under the labels 'Wi-Fi AP', 'Wi-Fi WAN', and 'IP Passthrough'.",
      "To regain access to a Pepwave device after a password change error, one can either factory default the unit or use InControl2 (IC2) to change the password.",
      "To enable one POE port on a Pepwave B30 Pro while using a 24VDC input power, a voltage boost converter can be utilized to increase the voltage from 24V nominal to 48V, which is required for POE output.",
      "In firmware version 7.0.1 of the Pepwave Soho 3, VLAN functionality was included, but it appears to have been removed in subsequent versions. The router also has a security feature that temporarily blocks any IP address with too many failed login attempts.",
      "To resolve a SIM card that is not connecting and cannot be removed, it is advised to power off the device. If the SIM card is partially visible, using tweezers to gently pull it out may help. If the SIM card is not visible, removing the device covers will be necessary to access the SIM card slot directly.",
      "To configure Peplink VPN behind a NAT device, it is necessary to create port forwarding for TCP port 32015 and UDP port 4500. However, if UDP port 4500 is already in use by another IPSec VPN on the NAT device, it may not allow additional port forwarding for that port. It is possible to configure Peplink VPN using only TCP port 32105, but this requires consistent settings on both sites for proper functionality.",

      "Peplink devices have been discussed in terms of their support for 5G in both NSA (Non-Standalone) and SA (Standalone) modes. However, the specific availability of SA bands may not be reflected in the Band Selection dropdown menu for certain devices, such as the HD1 Dome 5G running firmware version 8.3.0 RC3.",
      "The Peplink Max 5G can spoof the IP addresses of multiple modems while uploading data to a streaming server, making it appear to the destination service that all data is coming from the same IP address. To achieve this, the Peplink device would need to round robin the packets, sending them out over each interface in turn.",
      "Peplink's SpeedFusion Bonding technology allows for the aggregation of multiple internet connections, enabling data uploads over several modems while presenting a single source IP address to the streaming server. However, IP spoofing is not a viable method for achieving this, as it does not manage the underlying application streams effectively.",
      "The Peplink Max 5G can aggregate bandwidth using SpeedFusion VPN, which is beneficial for managing multiple WAN links for reliability and bandwidth during live video streams. However, it is important to note that bandwidth over cellular connections fluctuates constantly, so it is not simply a matter of summing the total bandwidth from multiple modems.",
      "Carrier aggregation (CA) can drop from a maximum of 5 bands to just 2 bands on Peplink hardware, such as the MAX BR1 5G Pro and MAX BR2 5G Pro, after approximately an hour of use. This behavior has been observed across multiple carriers including Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile, and occurs regardless of whether the CA bands are set to Auto or manually selected. The drop in CA may be influenced by factors such as limitations of the Sierra Wireless modem or Peplink firmware, or external factors related to tower transmission. Stress tests indicate that once the CA drops to 2 bands, it does not increase beyond that level during repeated use.",
      "The Peplink MAX BR1 Pro 5G has been certified for compatibility with AT&T's FirstNet service.",
      "There is an upcoming release of a Peplink 5G Dome expected in June, which may be relevant for users considering upgrading their yacht's internet setup.",
      "For a sailing boat installation of multi modem LTE, the Peplink Max HD2 Dome mounted at the top of a 45m carbon mast and the Peplink MBX Mini with two Mobility 40G antennas on the first spreader (10m high) are being compared. The MBX Mini's 4x4 MIMO antennas with higher effective gain are expected to provide better performance in terms of bandwidth and range compared to the HD2 Dome, particularly within 2.5NM/5km from cell towers, while still achieving a minimum of 500kbit/s for applications like WhatsApp calls and basic surfing/email. Load balancing capabilities may require specific service plans from Peplink, which could incur additional costs.",
      "To purchase a spare power supply for a Peplink UBR modem, it is recommended to specify the exact model of the Peplink device to obtain the correct part number. Authorized Peplink partners can provide quotes and are able to sell the necessary components based on their authorized territory.",
      "To address WAN DNS faults from the VSAT input on WAN 1, it is suggested to change the health check method to ping, targeting either the terminal or an internet address such as google.com. DNS lookups on VSAT can fail due to higher latency, and in many cases, it is recommended to disable the health check on VSAT entirely, as it is typically used only as a last resort.",
      "Peplink products are favored for their SpeedFusion technology and load balancing capabilities across multiple WAN connections, which enhance network security and performance. Users appreciate the ability to stabilize livestream setups using SpeedFusion and FusionHub. However, Peplink devices are often considered too expensive and complex for the average consumer, who may prefer simpler, plug-and-play solutions available at retail stores.",
      "To successfully route a UDP SRT stream through a SpeedFusion connection on a Pepwave MAX Transit Duo, changing the destination port from 10000 to 9000 resolved the issue. It is unclear why port 10000 was problematic, and there may be other port numbers that could also cause similar issues.",
      "For bonding multiple cellular connections, the HD4 MBX supports four active cellular connections with 2x MIMO antennas using SpeedFusion technology, but it comes at a high cost of around $6000. An alternative approach discussed involves using two Max Transit DUO units, each with two different cellular connections, to potentially bond up to four active links, although it is unclear if this configuration is supported. Antenna requirements include high gain solutions for long-distance signal reception, with the Poynting 402 being noted as a good 2x2 option, while larger omni antennas with 4x4 configurations are lacking in the market. The Max Transit has a bonding limitation of significantly under 100 Mbps, which may not meet performance needs.",
      "To resolve issues with the HD2 Dome not detecting the SIM card when using a SIM Injector, it is important to ensure that the HD2 Dome is running firmware version 8.1.0 and the SIM Injector is on firmware version 1.1.68. If problems continue after updating to the latest firmware, it is recommended to open a support ticket for further assistance.",
      "The expiry date for licenses related to SpeedFusion Cloud is based on the Care plan (EssentialCare, PrimeCare, SmartCare, and TotalCare) rather than the date the license is issued or activated by the user.",
      "To achieve bandwidth bonding using multiple SIM cards with a SIM Injector, the router must support multiple active SIM cards. The Peplink MAX BR1 only supports a single active SIM card, while models like the HD2 MBX support two active SIM cards, and the HD4 MBX supports four active SIM cards. Additionally, not all Peplink products are compatible with the SIM Injector.",
      "The correct cable for the power port in question is identified by the part number ACW-638, which can be purchased through certified partners.",
      "VoIP services over a Peplink MAX modem with Verizon should theoretically work since modems are generally agnostic to the data stream, including voice data. However, specific issues may arise depending on the VoIP provider and codec used. There are users in the USA successfully operating VoIP services over Verizon's network, indicating that it is possible to achieve functionality with the right setup.",
      "The issue reported involves a recurring bug in firmware version 8.0.2, where SpeedFusion connections on B710 routers become stuck in an 'updating routes' state, particularly when the routers have a high number of connections. The problem is more prevalent on B710s with many connections, with instances of stuck connections increasing significantly as the number of connections rises. The only resolution is to reboot the router or disable and enable the profile on the affected end. Additionally, the setup involves route isolation, which should be enabled at the hub site to prevent inter-access between head offices, and the design includes OSPF Discontiguous Areas to manage route advertisement between different areas.",
      "The Peplink MAX-BR1 currently does not have Class 1 Division 2 (C1D2) certification, which limits its sales potential in oil and gas sectors that require this certification. There is an ongoing effort to request the necessary certification for the MAX-BR1, and updates regarding certified products will be provided on the forum.",
      "For a MAX-HD4-LTEA-W-T installed on a boat for worldwide travel, it is advised to consult with a knowledgeable Peplink supplier regarding compatibility and performance issues, especially since modem requirements can differ between Asia/Pacific and Europe/Americas. The HD4 model does not support modem upgrades, which may limit its effectiveness for global use. Alternatives such as the HD4 MBX, HD2 MBX, or BPL-SDX are recommended, as they allow for future upgrades of cellular modules. Specifications for the next generation Cat 18 modules in Hong Kong and Asia are currently unavailable.",
      "In a high availability (HA) setup with two Peplink devices configured in Drop-In mode, the Peplink A and Peplink B are assigned IP addresses 192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.3 respectively, with a virtual IP of 192.168.1.1. The failover process works initially, but after multiple tests, the internet becomes unavailable when the master Peplink recovers and resumes its role. It is suggested to ensure that the latest firmware is being used and to perform a trace route to identify any issues in the network path.",
      "TotalCare is a service plan available only in North America that provides telephone support and advanced replacement for devices, along with an IC2 subscription. SmartCare also offers defective device replacement with advanced replacement for Dead On Arrival devices and includes an IC2 subscription. PrimeCare is a new service plan that includes an IC2 subscription, enhanced FusionHub licensing, and hardware warranty, but is limited to specific devices such as the Transit Mini and MAX Transit.",

      "The virtual SIM for remote provisioning is available on the Peplink HD2 Dome, which utilizes a SIM injector. The SIM injector is populated with physical SIM cards and connects to the HD2 Dome via Ethernet.",
      "After upgrading a SpeedFusion Engine from firmware version 7.1 to 8.1.0, a \"No SIM card detected\" message appeared for both SIMs. A downgrade to 8.0.2 resolved the issue but resulted in an alert stating that the \"Remote SIM Component not supported on this Firmware.\" To troubleshoot the 8.1.0 issue, it is suggested to perform the firmware upgrade again from 8.0.2 to 8.1.0 and check if the alert persists, and to use the \"Reload SIM\" option to see if it resolves the SIM detection issue.",
      "After updating a SpeedFusion Engine from version 7.1 to 8.1.0, the dashboard displayed 'No SIM card detected' for both SIMs. A downgrade to version 8.0.2 resolved the detection issue but resulted in an alert stating 'Remote SIM Component not supported on this Firmware'. The standard SpeedFusion Engine has an integrated SIM, but the SIM card holders are on a separate internal board.",
      "After updating a SpeedFusion Engine to version 8.1.0, a \"No SIM card detected\" error appeared for both SIMs, while downgrading to version 8.0.2 resulted in an alert indicating that the Remote SIM Component is not supported on that firmware. A potential troubleshooting step is to clean the SIM card to address possible contact issues with the SIM slot.",
      "After updating a SpeedFusion Engine from version 7.1 to 8.1.0, the Dashboard displayed 'No SIM card detected' for both SIMs. A downgrade to version 8.0.2 resolved the issue but resulted in an alert stating 'Remote SIM Component not supported on this Firmware.' This indicates a potential compatibility issue with the firmware version 8.1.0 regarding SIM detection.",
      "To activate a SIM card for a new BR1 MAX MK2, the IMEI number can be found on the device's box or obtained from the Peplink Partner from whom the device was purchased, as Peplink provides a method for Partners to look up the IMEI by serial number.",
      "To troubleshoot poor signal strength on a MAX-BR1-LTE-US, it is suggested to compare the cellular bands that both the phone and the PepLink device are connecting to. It is important to select the PepLink device to connect to the same band as the phone, if available. Additionally, checking the actual signal strength readings on both devices, rather than just the bar indicators, can provide a clearer understanding of the connectivity issues.",
      "When attempting to import a firewall rule set from a configuration file on a PepWave MAX BR1 Mini, an error message indicating failure to extract firewall rules may occur. To manage firewall rules by group policy rather than by device, it is suggested to enable the 'Manage Firewall Rules on Balance and MAX devices' option at the group level in the InControl2 Web Portal before importing the configuration file. If issues persist, contacting the InControl2 team for support may be necessary.",
      "The Peplink ONE allows users to view the MAC addresses of devices connected to the network by mousing over the particular session, but this information is only available for active sessions. This capability can assist in identifying users engaging in specific activities, such as BitTorrent downloads, although the response does not explicitly confirm the ability to block such traffic.",
      "Using a Peplink device, it is possible to implement content filtering to block BitTorrent users, which can help reduce network data usage and demonstrate compliance with legal usage. This setup allows for fair usage among all users in a network, and it can assist in managing network activity effectively.",
      "After a router's warranty period, users can purchase an InControl2 (IC2) subscription for models like the Balance 20 and Surf SOHO, which provides access to IC2 but does not cover hardware warranty. An extended warranty can also be purchased for those who want both IC2 access and hardware coverage. The subscription is a more affordable option for IC2 manageability alone.",
      "The Pepwave MAX 700 can create IPsec tunnels to compatible devices such as Cisco, Juniper, or Peplink devices, allowing for one tunnel per WAN connection. It supports failover configurations to maintain IPsec connectivity if one WAN goes down. For enhanced bandwidth utilization, a Peplink Balance device (such as Balance 580 or above) can be used at the main office to create a Site-to-Site VPN with the MAX 700, utilizing VPN bonding technology to combine the bandwidth of all Internet links. The Pepwave MAX 700 has 2 Ethernet interfaces, supporting up to two DSL links, while the Peplink Balance 310 or above supports at least three Ethernet interfaces and one USB port for additional 3G/4G connectivity.",
      "In a Peplink One setup with multiple WANs, if devices assigned to a primary WAN are not failing over to secondary WANs during an outage, it may be due to priority settings on the dashboard that override outbound policy configurations. For the outbound policy priorities to function correctly, all WANs must be set to priority #1. Updating the firmware from version 8.1.3 to 8.2.0 did not resolve the issue of devices not switching to alternative WANs during an outage.",
      "For a Peplink One with multiple WANs, if devices configured with a priority order are not failing over to secondary WANs during an outage, it is essential to ensure that a Health Check is configured on the affected WAN. Without a health check, the router will not detect the outage and will not initiate failover to other WANs, resulting in a loss of internet connectivity for those devices.",
      "The Balance 305 device has a CMOS battery that may cause issues if it dies. It is recommended to keep the device under warranty with Peplink, as they can replace the battery through a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) process.",
      "In a SpeedFusion tunnel configuration with two LTE connections of differing performance, the overall speed may be slower than the fastest bonded connection, resulting in only the average speed being reported rather than the total speed minus overhead. The upload limit may contribute to packet loss, and it is important to identify the source of any limits causing this issue, especially when no limits are configured.",
      "The Standard Hardware/Software Warranty Policy indicates that if a device experiences problems within 14 days of purchase, a better arrangement should be made for replacement. However, if the device is reported after 14 days, the replacement may not be a new unit unless smart care was ordered at the time of purchase. It is also suggested that the device may not yet be registered with Peplink, which could affect warranty claims.",
      "The Balance One Core router can use both WAN connections simultaneously through load balancing, which allows for seamless internet access without noticeable interruptions for most applications. However, if a conference call is in progress over WAN 1 and that connection fails, the call would drop unless SpeedFusion is enabled, which allows for uninterrupted transitions to WAN 2. SpeedFusion is a VPN technology that can be implemented between Peplink devices, and it can be set up in three ways: connecting Peplink hardware to another Peplink hardware, connecting Peplink hardware to FusionHub, or connecting to SpeedFusion Cloud. The latter is the simplest method for testing SpeedFusion. Users can create outbound policies and VLANs to manage traffic routing effectively, allowing specific traffic to utilize SpeedFusion while other traffic continues to use load balancing.",
      "To troubleshoot issues with Windows 10 computers synchronizing clocks with time.windows.com while using a SpeedFusion connection to a FusionHub, it is important to ensure that UDP Port 123 is open, as it is required for NTP (Network Time Protocol). Testing with another NTP server outside of the country may also help identify the issue, which could potentially be related to firewall settings.",
      "When experiencing issues with Windows 10 computers synchronizing clocks with time.windows.com over a SpeedFusion connection to a FusionHub, it is important to ensure that outbound traffic is allowed and that no outbound ports are blocked. The stateful firewall should permit the response to outbound NTP requests without requiring a specific inbound rule for NTP.",
      "To prevent internet traffic from stopping when one WAN connection fails on a Balance One router, it is important to configure health check settings properly. The health check method should be set up to accurately detect when a WAN is down, as the current settings may still be receiving replies even when the WAN is not functioning. Additionally, WAN failures will be logged in the system log for further analysis.",
      "Firmware upgrades for Peplink devices are provided for free regardless of the warranty status of the device, meaning users can continue to receive firmware updates beyond the initial one-year period without needing to purchase a support license.",
      "The management of Peplink devices can be done through InControl2, which is a cloud-based management platform. It allows for the management of multiple devices, providing a centralized interface for configuration and monitoring.",
      "To troubleshoot SpeedFusion connectivity problems, it is important to ensure that TCP port 32015 is open, as it is used for the 'handshake' necessary to establish the tunnel.",
      "To regain web-based control of devices through InControl2 after the warranty period has expired, one can purchase an InControl subscription for 12 or 24 months (SKU: ICS-012, ICS-024).

Power cycling the device temporarily restores functionality for varying durations. Troubleshooting steps taken include changing the MTU settings to auto from 1440, upgrading firmware from 7.01 to 7.02, modifying the LAN IP address, and blocking all inbound connections. No new configurations were made prior to the issue arising, and the device is still under warranty until 2019.",
      "TotalCare is a support policy offered by Peplink that is only available in North America.",
      "SpeedFusion VPN is a suitable solution for aggregating multiple internet connections to enhance stability and reduce disconnects. It includes features such as Hot Failover, which automatically switches to another available connection during a failure, ensuring no downtime. WAN Smoothing addresses packet loss by sending extra packets that can be reconstructed, while also optimizing traffic to the connection with the lowest latency. Bandwidth Bonding combines multiple connections into a single high-speed connection, though it may not be necessary for all setups. It is important to note that SpeedFusion VPN requires Peplink devices on both ends of the tunnel for operation.",
      "To establish remote access to a server through a Peplink modem using an L2TP VPN connection, the user should connect to the modem and then access the server by entering its LAN IP address. It is also important to ensure that the Mac is configured to route all traffic over the VPN connection to successfully reach the server.",

      "To address speed issues with a SpeedFusion tunnel using two LTE connections, it is important to manage the performance of each connection, particularly when one is degraded. A suggested approach is to adjust settings based on Latency Difference Cutoff to prevent the degraded connection from lowering the overall speed of the tunnel. Additionally, the performance of each cellular connection can vary significantly, with one connection (LTE12) having a better external antenna than the other (LTE4), which may affect overall performance. It is also noted that using SIM cards from different providers without splitters or amplifiers should not cause interference, but further investigation into potential anomalies is encouraged.",
      "In a SpeedFusion tunnel setup with two LTE connections, the overall speed may be slower than the fastest bonded connection due to the averaging of speeds rather than a total aggregation, which can be affected by overhead. Latency measurements with different cutoff values (30 ms and 150 ms) were tested, revealing that both links exhibit similar latencies when active. Troubleshooting packet loss may involve investigating whether the Fusion Hub is dropping packets, as both endpoints show separate latency and packet loss values. Signal quality for the LTE connections is also a factor, with one connection being LTE4 and the other LTE12.",
      "In a SpeedFusion tunnel configuration with two LTE connections from different ISPs and towers, the overall speed may be slower than the fastest individual connection due to averaging effects and overhead. Issues such as bufferbloat can affect performance, with packet loss observed in one of the LTE connections. To diagnose the cause of the speed limitation, one can test whether the tunnel or the individual LTE connection is the bottleneck. If the tunnel is limited to 50 MBit, it may indicate tower bufferbloat, suggesting the need to cap the connection speed in the router. If the LTE connection itself is limited, other components like the Peplink 20X or SpeedFusion Solo may be contributing to the issue.",
      "The user is experiencing slower speeds on their SpeedFusion tunnel compared to the bonded fastest connection, indicating that the performance is only averaging the speeds of two LTE connections rather than combining them effectively. The user has two LTE connections with different performance levels, and the result reflects the average speed rather than the total speed, which suggests overhead is impacting the performance. A test conducted with a MikroTik LTE12 modem and a MikroTik server in AWS showed zero packet loss, leading to the conclusion that the modem, AWS, and ISP are not responsible for the packet loss observed on Cellular 1.",
      "When experiencing slower speeds in a SpeedFusion tunnel compared to the bonded fastest connection, it is suggested to test the configuration using Peplink's 'Experimental' TCP mode instead of the standard TCP mode. This may help in achieving better performance, as the average speed of bonded connections can be affected by the type of protocol used during testing.",
      "In a SpeedFusion tunnel configuration with two LTE connections of different performance levels, the overall speed may be slower than the fastest bonded connection, resulting in only the average speed being reported rather than the total speed minus overhead. WAN analysis shows zero packet loss at 50 Mbps upload, with occasional packet loss observed at 50 Mbps under certain conditions, and significant packet loss at 60 Mbps. The LTE/LTE-A (CAT4/CAT6) provider subscription officially supports up to 50 Mbps upload, which is being achieved effectively.",
      "In a SpeedFusion tunnel configuration with two LTE connections, the overall speed may be slower than the bonded fastest connection due to the limitation of the tunnel bandwidth, which is capped at 100 MBps.

Adding an external antenna to Cell 2 significantly reduced latency, and replacing Cell 2 with a CAT6 modem enabled carrier aggregation of primary band 3 (1800 MHz) and secondary band 7 (2600 MHz). It was noted that Weighted Dynamic Bonding provided better maximum bandwidth compared to standard bonding, but SpeedFusion did not fully utilize the available bandwidth of a single WAN connection when only one was active.",
      "In a SpeedFusion tunnel setup with two LTE connections, the overall speed may be slower than the fastest bonded connection due to averaging speeds and overhead. Users have noted that older bonding methods may perform better than new dynamic weighted algorithms.

Additionally, the latency difference cutoff can significantly affect performance, with optimal settings found between 50ms and 75ms. Specific connection performance details include T-Mobile with high latency and variable speeds, and AT&T with lower latency and more stable speeds, achieving up to 120Mbps inside the tunnel and over 200Mbps outside.",
      "In a SpeedFusion tunnel setup with two LTE connections of differing performance, the overall speed may be slower than the fastest bonded connection due to averaging effects and overhead. If one connection experiences degradation, it can negatively impact the entire tunnel's performance. Adjusting latency cutoffs to 150 ms can help optimize performance. Dynamic Weighted Bonding may provide better results than standard bonding by allowing for more efficient use of bandwidth, especially when one connection is underperforming.",
      "In a SpeedFusion tunnel setup with two LTE connections of different performance, the overall speed may be slower than the fastest bonded connection due to averaging speeds rather than achieving the total of both connections, minus overhead. Testing configurations include WAN Smoothing, Bonded with low Forward Error Correction (FEC) and a cutoff differential, and Dynamic WAN Balancing (DWB). DWB has shown to achieve higher burst speeds compared to bonded connections, while bonded configurations are better for balancing traffic across both connections.",

    "query": "Why might a SpeedFusion tunnel with two LTE connections deliver slower speeds than the fastest individual link, and what steps can be taken to optimize throughput, based on real-world deployments and troubleshooting examples?",
    "answer": "A SpeedFusion tunnel using two LTE connections can deliver slower speeds than the fastest individual link because bonded throughput is often limited by the slowest or most latent connection, resulting in average or lower-than-expected speeds rather than a simple sum. This occurs due to the way SpeedFusion handles packet distribution, overhead, and the need to manage differing latencies and packet loss across links. Real-world deployments show that if one LTE link is degraded (e.g., higher latency, packet loss, or lower bandwidth), it can drag down the overall tunnel performance. To optimize throughput, several steps should be taken: (1) ensure both LTE connections have good signal quality and minimal interference, (2) use high-quality, properly positioned antennas to reduce cross-talk and maximize signal, (3) adjust SpeedFusion settings such as latency cutoff and dynamic weighted bonding to favor the better-performing link, (4) update to the latest firmware to benefit from recent improvements in bonding algorithms, (5) avoid including high-latency or unstable links in the bond, and (6) test with different protocol modes (such as experimental TCP) to identify the mode that best suits the connection characteristics. Monitoring WAN statistics, packet loss, latency, and firmware version is essential to fine-tune the configuration and achieve the best possible performance.",

The MAX HD2 supports this technology, allowing for the aggregation of WAN connections into a single high-throughput connection. The maximum throughput for SpeedFusion on the MAX HD2 is 100 Mbps without encryption and 60 Mbps with encryption. It is necessary to connect the MAX HD2 to a Peplink Balance 210, which should be located in a datacenter with a WAN connection speed that meets or exceeds the total bandwidth being bonded. Care should be taken to avoid including high latency connections in the bonding process, as they can negatively impact performance.",
      "To aggregate and bond multiple SIM cards and a USB modem for a single high-capacity connection using a Pepwave Max HD2, SpeedFusion Bonding technology is required. This involves using two SpeedFusion VPN appliances, with one being a FusionHub Appliance hosted in the cloud. This setup allows for continuous connectivity necessary for streaming applications like Wirecast to Facebook Live. A trial license for the FusionHub virtual appliance is available for testing purposes.",
      "To aggregate and bond multiple SIM cards and a USB modem for a stable connection suitable for streaming with Wirecast, it is essential to have a stable public-facing IP address on SpeedFusion, which can be achieved using a physical Balance router or a virtual appliance like FusionHub. A MAX router may also be suitable depending on the licensing and connection requirements. This setup is necessary to ensure a continuous connection for streaming purposes.",
      "The current firmware for the Pepwave MAX-BR1-LTE-E-T does not display the connected frequency band information for the cellular connection. However, there is a band selection function available that can be enabled, allowing users to manually assign a frequency band in the BR1."

    "query": "What are the key technical differences and considerations when choosing between the Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini (HW3), MAX BR1 Pro LTE-A, and MAX BR1 Pro 5G for high-throughput, multi-carrier, and future-proof deployments?",
    "answer": "When selecting between the Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini (HW3), MAX BR1 Pro LTE-A, and MAX BR1 Pro 5G for high-throughput, multi-carrier, and future-proof deployments, it is important to consider several technical factors:\n\nThe MAX BR1 Mini (HW3) has a rated throughput of 300 Mbps, even though its WAN port is 1 Gbps; real-world TCP throughput is typically about 270\u2013300 Mbps. Enabling additional features on the Mini can further reduce throughput, sometimes as low as 50 Mbps. The Mini uses Wi-Fi 5, supports nano SIM cards, and requires a failover license for Wi-Fi WAN. It is compatible with both AT&T and Verizon, and supports LTE and LTE-A variants for band compatibility, but does not support the latest bands such as T-Mobile's Band 71 or FirstNet Band 14. The LTE-A version is recommended for faster speeds and better band support.\n\nThe MAX BR1 Pro LTE-A offers up to 200 Mbps router throughput and provides a better LTE-A experience compared to the Mini. It supports more advanced LTE-A features and is certified for FirstNet (Band 14), making it suitable for public safety and advanced carrier deployments. The Pro LTE-A is also more future-proof than the Mini due to its expanded band support.\n\nThe MAX BR1 Pro 5G is the most advanced, featuring a Cat 20 5G modem, 2.5 Gbps WAN/LAN port, up to 1 Gbps throughput, and 5G/4G LTE compatibility. It supports band 71 (T-Mobile) and FirstNet (Band 14), offers five-band carrier aggregation for downloads, and uses Wi-Fi 6 for improved wireless performance. It is backwards compatible with 4G LTE, supports dual nano SIMs, and is designed for maximum future-proofing and multi-carrier deployments. It also features enhanced antenna options, GPS, and accessories for installation flexibility.\n\nIn summary, the BR1 Mini is cost-effective for basic LTE/LTE-A needs, the BR1 Pro LTE-A suits higher performance and public safety, while the BR1 Pro 5G is the optimal choice for highest throughput, latest band support, and future-proofing in demanding, multi-carrier environments.",

      "To troubleshoot lower than expected download speeds on a Peplink Balance One, it is suggested to test the device using a Linux operating system, as it has shown consistent throughput in testing. In contrast, testing on macOS and Windows operating systems may yield less reliable results.",
      "The Peplink Balance One is rated for 600Mbps throughput, but users are experiencing download speeds between 260Mbps and 303Mbps, which is significantly lower than expected. In contrast, the same device connected to a pfSense box achieves over 500Mbps download speeds, suggesting that there may be an issue with the Peplink device itself or its configuration.",
      "To enable automatic configuration synchronization between two Peplink 710 units in a High Availability (HA) setup, the Config Sync feature must be enabled. Once this feature is activated, all changes made on the Master unit will automatically be applied to the Slave unit without requiring manual synchronization.",
      "In a high availability (HA) setup between two Peplink 710 units, configuration synchronization from the master to the slave unit is not fully automatic. Manual synchronization is required after changes are made on the master unit, indicating a limitation in the Peplink Balance regarding automatic updates between units."

    "query": "How does the Peplink Balance 20X router achieve reliable, high-throughput, redundant internet connectivity for branch or home office deployments, and what are the key configuration options and limitations to consider when using multiple WAN and cellular connections, including SpeedFusion bonding, hardware expansion, power supply, and firmware version impacts?",
    "answer": "The Peplink Balance 20X router is designed for branch and home office use, providing high-throughput (up to 900 Mbps) and reliable connectivity through a combination of Ethernet WAN, built-in LTE modem, USB WAN, and expansion modules. It supports redundant internet connectivity by allowing connections to multiple WAN sources, including Starlink, DSL, and up to three cellular links (via embedded modem, FlexModule Mini slot, and USB port), making it suitable for failover and load balancing. SpeedFusion technology enables bonding and seamless failover across WAN and cellular connections, enhancing reliability for critical applications like VoIP and video calls. The Balance 20X includes features like dual-band Wi-Fi, VLAN support, centralized management through InControl2, and captive portal options. For the best performance and reliability, using a DC-DC buck-boost regulator is recommended in DC-only environments. Hardware expansion is possible with additional modem modules (Cat 6, 12, 18, and future 5G), but the USB WAN port is limited to 100 Mbps. Firmware version impacts throughput: firmware 8.0.1 achieves near 900 Mbps, while 8.0.2 and some later versions may reduce throughput to around 550 Mbps, so firmware selection is crucial. PrimeCare subscription is necessary for SpeedFusion Cloud, and care should be taken when configuring outbound policies and failover. The router does not support Wi-Fi WAN, and for maximum reliability, the choice of cellular module (Cat 4, 6, or higher) may affect stability, especially for continuous streaming or backup scenarios.",

      "To make a USB enclosure available to everyone on a network when using a MAX Transit, one can repurpose an old laptop by reinstalling the operating system and connecting the USB drive or printer to it. The laptop can then be configured to share the USB device over the network, providing a simple solution for network-wide access.",
      "To achieve better bandwidth for live streaming, using a Pepwave Max On-The-Go 3G/4G Router with Load Balancing and SpeedFusion is recommended. The traffic should be routed across the SpeedFusion VPN tunnel to a Peplink device located at a headquarters or datacenter, which will then connect to streaming services like Dacast or Livestream.",
      "For live streaming business requiring more bandwidth than a single USB modem can provide, a balancing and bonding router is recommended. The Pepwave Max On-The-Go 3G/4G Router with Load Balancing and SpeedFusion technology is suitable for achieving throughput of 35 to 50 Mbps. Further information can be found in the provided article link."

    "query": "How does SpeedFusion technology enable bandwidth bonding across multiple WAN connections, what are the hardware requirements and firmware considerations, and how does it compare to traditional bonding methods such as IPsec and LACP?",
    "answer": "SpeedFusion technology is Peplink\u2019s proprietary solution for bandwidth bonding, allowing multiple WAN connections\u2014including DSL, cable, 4G/5G, and satellite\u2014to be aggregated into a single, reliable, high-throughput connection. To achieve this, at least two SpeedFusion-capable devices (such as Balance 210, 310, or higher, or FusionHub as a virtual appliance) are required, with one device typically deployed at the branch and another at a datacenter or cloud. The devices must have SpeedFusion licenses, and the correct firmware version for the hardware revision; compatibility between different firmware versions should be checked to ensure seamless operation. Unlike traditional bonding methods such as IPsec and LACP, SpeedFusion does not require identical circuits; it dynamically adapts to latency, packet loss, or bandwidth fluctuations, making it more versatile and robust. SpeedFusion tunnels can be used for both point-to-point and hub-and-spoke topologies, provide seamless failover, and maintain session persistence even during WAN outages. In contrast, IPsec is sensitive to WAN disruptions and does not support session persistence, while LACP requires identical physical circuits and is not tolerant of variable internet conditions. SpeedFusion also offers enhanced security by creating separate encryption keys for each WAN link. Overall, SpeedFusion enables organizations to maximize internet reliability and performance beyond what is possible with legacy bonding technologies.",

      "The video discusses advanced networking features related to Peplink's SpeedFusion technology, including dynamic weighted bonding and traffic management. Users can configure outbound policies based on source IP, MAC address, or SSID, allowing for tailored traffic shaping and prioritization. The system supports Wi-Fi management, enabling users to turn off Wi-Fi for specific devices or on a schedule, and to set minimum signal strength for fast transitions between access points. Firewall rules can be created to manage inbound and outbound traffic based on application type, destination regions, and internal VLANs, allowing for granular control over network access. Additionally, DHCP guarding is mentioned as a method to manage trusted and untrusted zones within the network.",
      "To manage WAN connections effectively, one can use various outbound policies on Pepwave routers. The user is currently using the Least Used policy, which prioritizes connections based on download bandwidth, but is experiencing issues with upload saturation affecting web browsing. The Overflow policy routes traffic through the highest priority healthy WAN connection that is not in full load, but it is defined by download bandwidth. The user suggests that an ideal setting would allow Overflow to be triggered by upload bandwidth instead. Firmware 8.4 introduces an option for the Least Used policy to be set by uplink, but this still defaults to the Fiber connection due to its higher uplink capacity, which is not desired for the user's needs.",
      "When comparing router throughput for home use, the PepLink Balance 20X offers a throughput of 900Mbps, which is a suitable option for handling multiple devices including 4 PCs, NAS, and additional smart devices.

      "To create a VPN connection between two Peplink units, such as the BPL 305 and BPL 310, it is important to refer to the user manual for detailed instructions. Additionally, if there is a router or firewall in front of the Peplink devices, port forwarding must be configured for the default protocols TCP 32015 and UDP 4500 to ensure proper connectivity.",
      "To improve performance on a Peplink Balance 30 with multiple connections, it is recommended to adjust the Outbound policy to custom rules. For services like Netflix and Hulu that require consistent IP addresses, create a rule for HTTPS traffic (TCP, port 443) with persistence by source and adjust the WAN speed bias. Additionally, for services using HTTP, identify their IP addresses and create a rule that directs traffic to those IPs with persistence by source, allowing for better management of bandwidth and session stability.",
      "To direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on the Peplink Balance 20/30 series, outbound policy can be utilized to control which server or type of traffic exits through which link. This ensures that return traffic comes back on the same link it was sent out on, maintaining the integrity of sessions such as FTP. If an FTP session is established on WAN1, Peplink will consistently route that FTP traffic through WAN1.",
      "To direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on a Peplink Balance 20/30 series router, an outbound policy rule can be created. This allows for the configuration of traffic routing, ensuring that certain types of traffic, such as FTP, are directed through a designated WAN connection without round-robin switching between multiple WANs.",

However, while Peplink appliances are primarily SD-WAN devices with reliable firewall capabilities, they may not fully replace the functionality of existing SRX firewalls. It is recommended to conduct thorough testing and refer to technical documentation for deployment guidance.",
      "To verify the functionality of a PEPVPN connection between two Peplink Balance 20 routers, one can perform a ping test from a PC on one network to the LAN IP of the other router. If the ping is successful, it indicates that the VPN is operational. Additionally, users can log into the web UI of Balance Router A, navigate to System -> Tools, and use the ping feature to test connectivity to the LAN of Balance Router B. This process can be repeated from the B network to confirm the VPN connection.",
      "To optimize WAN performance on a Peplink Balance 20, users should configure outbound policies to manage traffic effectively. Setting the default weighted balance to 1 for both WAN connections can help in balancing TCP connections across the two WANs. This configuration allows for better utilization of available bandwidth from both xDSL and 4G connections.",
      "To manage outbound policies for devices using streaming services like Netflix and Hulu on a Peplink Balance 30, it is suggested to create rules based on the source IP of the devices rather than relying solely on destination domains, especially for complex domains like those associated with Amazon Web Services. This can be achieved by setting the source to the specific IP address of the device, allowing for more precise control over the outbound connection used for those devices.",
      "To set up a Peplink 30 with WAN1 configured for Bell Canada fiber and multiple static IPs, ensure that the outside Gateway is defined correctly on the Peplink. For WAN1, the static IP is 66.x.x.148 with a subnet of 255.255.255.252/30 and a Gateway of 66.x.x.147. The usable static IPs for WAN1 are 204.x.x.129 with a subnet of 255.255.255.240/28 and a Gateway of 204.x.x.129, allowing for static IPs ranging from 204.x.x.130 to 142. For WAN2, which is connected to Videotron, only one static IP is obtained since the Gateway is set on a Videotron router. NAT configuration may be necessary for proper routing and IP management.",
      "In a Peplink setup using session-based load balancing, if WAN2 and WAN3 fail, active sessions will not persist due to the IP change, and all packets will not route through WAN1 without loss. SpeedFusion technology can bond all WAN connections, allowing for seamless packet routing to other links if one WAN fails, thus preventing loss of active sessions. For the Overflow load balancing algorithm, Peplink considers only the downstream bandwidth utilization of each WAN link to determine routing according to the configured Overflow priority.",
      "A Peplink Balance 20 or 30 can combine both DSL and cable internet connections for load balancing and automatic failover, ensuring continuous connectivity. The AP One access points are suitable for enhancing wireless coverage in larger homes, utilizing TruePower RF technology for increased signal strength.

For higher throughput needs, upgrading to a Peplink Balance 380, which supports up to 170Mbps, is recommended. The Peplink Balance can provide benefits such as traffic prioritization through load balancing, quality of service (QoS) assignment on an application or port level, and hardware firewall capabilities, enhancing overall network performance and flexibility.",
      "To optimize internet speed on a Peplink Balance 310 with multiple WAN connections, it is recommended to create a weighted balance rule for all protocols, adjusting the weights according to the bandwidth of each connection. For example, a ratio of 7 for the 2Mbps connection and 10 for the 3Mbps connections may be effective. Specific outbound rules for individual protocols should be prioritized by placing them at the top of the rule list, as higher rules take precedence. This setup allows the Peplink router to distribute traffic effectively across all WAN links, potentially improving overall speed as all connections are utilized simultaneously.",
      "On a Peplink Balance 20, outbound requests can be configured to utilize all WAN connections through the custom rules option. Aggregation of bandwidth occurs when the server supports multiple sessions, which is often the case with speed testing services like speedtest.net. This explains the difference in performance between two Balance 20 devices when using identical 25 Mbps ADSL2+ lines, where one is aggregating and the other is load balancing.",
      "To configure a Peplink PEP20 with multiple WAN connections and static IPs, it is recommended to change the outbound policy to 'Managed by Custom Rules' for better control over traffic balancing. It is important to retain the default rules, such as HTTPS Persistence and the default weighted balance rule, which are based on the upstream and downstream bandwidth values set for each WAN connection.",

The classic Balance 30 LTE retains its CAT3 LTE configuration, while the new Balance 30 Pro offers enhanced capabilities with LTE-Advanced technology.",
      "In a Peplink Balance Two setup, if outbound policy is not directing traffic as expected, it may be due to the order of rules. The HTTPS Persistence rule is processed before the default priority rule, leading to traffic being sent to WAN2. To resolve this, one can either set the outbound policy to custom and adjust the ratio for WAN2 to zero, or create a higher priority HTTPS rule for WAN1 that allows fall-through to the next rule if it fails, ensuring that WAN1 is prioritized for HTTPS traffic.",
      "The Peplink Balance 20 has a throughput of 150Mbps, which is less than the combined total of the user's WAN connections (100/5M, 150/6M, and 35/5M). For users with 20-30 connections, particularly for applications like Zoom, upgrading to a Peplink Balance 305 is recommended due to its higher capacity and performance, supporting up to 1Gbps throughput. Alternatively, the Balance 210 with an additional license can provide a maximum throughput of 350Mbps, but it is not as capable as the Balance 305.",

In such cases, contacting the carrier's technical support may be necessary to resolve the activation problem.",
      "SpeedFusion operates at the packet level, while Outbound Policy functions at the session level. The bonding algorithm can effectively fill both links equally with proper tweaks to cutoffs. The Dynamic Weighted Balance (DWB) algorithm is noted for its throughput but can be unpredictable, sometimes favoring one link significantly over another. The Lowest Latency option may alternate between links rapidly if they have similar performance. The Overflow option is based on defined bandwidth for connections, but it cannot be applied to cellular links, as it is designed for wired connections only. Users can attempt to set bandwidth on a wired connection to manage overflow to cellular links.",
      "A Peplink balance router can perform session-based load balancing, where a single session is limited by the WAN link it is using, but users will see combined bandwidth across all their sessions. For higher bandwidth utilization, SpeedFusion Bonding allows a single session to be distributed at a packet level across multiple WAN links simultaneously.

      "In a Peplink Balance One setup with two WAN connections, the Overflow load balancing algorithm allows traffic to be routed through the primary WAN connection (WAN2) until it reaches full capacity, at which point new sessions can be routed through the secondary WAN connection (WAN1) if it is not saturated. However, load balancing can lead to unexpected behavior, such as when a task is split into batches, resulting in one WAN connection finishing its tasks while the other continues to process, potentially leading to inefficiencies in overall upload times.",
      "The Peplink 20 utilizes outbound policies for user requests to websites hosted on the Internet, allowing for return traffic via different WAN connections based on the configured policy. Inbound connections, such as an Internet user accessing a website hosted behind the Peplink, depend on the IP address provided by the DNS server, which determines the specific WAN through which the connection will be established.",
      "The Peplink 20 does not support inbound load balancing, meaning inbound traffic is handled on a first-come, first-served basis without prioritization based on connection speed or bandwidth. For outbound traffic, users can select from different policies: 'High Application Compatibility' routes all outbound traffic from the same LAN host to the same WAN connection regardless of destination, while 'Normal Application Compatibility' routes traffic from the same LAN host to the same WAN connection for the same destination IP, allowing for WAN link load balancing when accessing multiple servers.",
      "To achieve desired traffic distribution on a Peplink Balance 305 with multiple WAN connections, changing the Outbound Policy algorithm from 'HTTPS Persistence' to 'Priority' is recommended. This adjustment will ensure that traffic primarily utilizes WAN 1, while also enabling the 'Terminate Sessions on Link Recovery' option to maintain connection on WAN 1 when it recovers from a failure. The current configuration with HTTPS Persistence causes traffic to be distributed across all WANs, leading to an unintended 60/30/10 traffic split.",
      "To manage traffic on a Peplink Balance 20 router and prevent Netflix and torrent traffic from using a satellite connection, outbound policies can be applied based on source IP, destination IP, domain, or application ports. It is suggested to identify the source IP of devices like a smart TV for Netflix and route its traffic through WAN2 (microwave connection) using enforced outbound policies.

It is suggested that compatibility may depend on the availability of drivers for these newer dongles.",
      "With Peplink routers running firmware version 6.2, users can utilize seven different load balancing algorithms. For a scenario where ADSL is the primary connection, the Overflow algorithm can be employed to manage traffic effectively. Additionally, users can create specific rules using the enforced or priority algorithm to direct certain traffic, such as streaming services, over the satellite connection. It is important to note that the order of rules in the outbound policy list matters, with more defined rules taking precedence over the Overflow algorithm, which should be placed at the bottom.",
      "To manage internet connectivity on a Peplink Balance One router with two WAN connections, it is suggested to use the Priority Algorithm instead of the Overflow rule. The Overflow rule only reroutes new sessions to the next WAN connection when the primary WAN is saturated, which may not address issues caused by external factors affecting WAN1. Therefore, if WAN1 becomes sluggish due to external interference, the Priority Algorithm can help ensure that WAN2 is utilized more effectively during such conditions.",
      "When experiencing low internet throughput with a Peplink Balance 50 connected to multiple internet connections, it is important to check the router's specifications, particularly the 'Router Throughput' which includes both download and upload speeds.

      "The Pepwave routers utilize various load balancing algorithms to manage WAN connections effectively. The Weighted Balance algorithm distributes traffic based on the specified weights of each WAN connection. The Persistence algorithm ensures that traffic from a client computer maintains the same WAN connection for secure services, with modes available for source and destination persistence. The Enforced algorithm routes traffic through a specified WAN connection regardless of its health status. The Priority algorithm uses the highest priority WAN connection available for routing, while the Overflow algorithm routes traffic through the healthiest connection that is not fully loaded. The Least Used algorithm selects the WAN connection with the most available download bandwidth, and the Lowest Latency algorithm routes traffic through the connection with the lowest latency, determined by periodic latency checks.",
      "The Outbound Policy feature in Peplink routers allows users to define how LAN-to-Internet traffic is routed using various algorithms such as Weighted Balance, Persistence, Enforced, Priority, Overflow, Least Used, Lowest Latency, and Fastest Response Time. Each algorithm serves different purposes, such as distributing traffic based on bandwidth, ensuring consistent routing for specific traffic types, or prioritizing connections based on availability. The Fastest Response Time algorithm duplicates traffic across all healthy connections at the start of a session and routes it based on the first response received, making it suitable for time-sensitive applications like VoIP. The configuration of Outbound Policy rules is done through the Peplink UI, where users can specify service names, source and destination metrics, protocols, and algorithms, with options for session termination on link recovery and expert mode for routing outside of SpeedFusion tunnels.",

IP persistence ensures that once a connection is established, all traffic remains on that WAN until the session ends, which is crucial for maintaining reliable SSL sessions. Enforced traffic routing allows specific applications, such as Windows updates or guest networks, to use designated internet connections, preventing them from failing over to more expensive options. Priority routing enables the selection of preferred connections based on performance, allowing for failover to backup connections only if the primary fails. The video also touches on the overflow method, which allows for dynamic bandwidth allocation by utilizing a slower connection until it reaches capacity, at which point it can overflow into a faster connection. Lastly, the least used algorithm distributes new sessions across connections based on their current bandwidth usage, optimizing overall throughput.",
      "The video discusses the configuration of outbound policies for managing multiple WAN connections, particularly in a maritime context. It explains the use of priority settings for SIM cards, where a primary SIM card is used first, followed by secondary cards if the primary fails. The three main outbound policies covered are weighted balance, priority, and enforced. Weighted balance allows traffic to be distributed across multiple connections based on defined ratios, which is particularly useful for load balancing in dynamic environments like maritime. Priority routes traffic through the preferred connection as long as it is healthy, while enforced restricts specific traffic to a single defined connection. The video also demonstrates how to create VLANs and outbound policies to manage traffic effectively, ensuring that the best available connection is utilized, whether it be port Wi-Fi, cellular, or satellite, with provisions for failover and load balancing based on connection availability.",

The video also covers the importance of managing outbound policies in relation to routing protocols like BGP and OSPF, and the use of InControl2 for managing traffic based on destination regions and applications. SpeedFusion requires two compatible units for bonding and offers various configurations such as point-to-point, mesh, and star. Additionally, it details features like bandwidth bonding, WAN smoothing, hot failover, and PepVPN for enhanced connectivity and reliability.",
      "Outbound policies in Peplink are used for traffic shaping and routing, allowing for the configuration of how traffic is directed through WAN connections. These policies operate on a top-down basis, meaning that the order of the policies affects their application. If a default route is being pushed via BGP or OSPF, it can override user-defined traffic shaping protocols unless the policies are reordered appropriately. Peplink's InControl adds features such as priority routing and dynamically updated definitions for cloud applications, which are not available outside of this management platform. The system supports multiple load balancing algorithms, including weighted balance, enforced priority, and least used, with the latter now considering both downlink and uplink bandwidth. Troubleshooting involves monitoring status lights and dashboard indicators to assess device health and connectivity, with specific light patterns indicating various states of operation. If a device fails to connect, it may indicate issues with SIM card detection or account activation, which can be diagnosed through the dashboard's WAN status indicators.",

    "query": "How can outbound policy rules on Peplink Balance 20/30 series routers be used to direct specific types of traffic or devices to designated WAN connections, and what are the key algorithms, configuration steps, and best practices for optimizing performance and session integrity in multi-WAN environments?",
    "answer": "Outbound policy rules on Peplink Balance 20/30 series routers allow administrators to direct specific types of traffic or devices to designated WAN connections, optimizing performance and maintaining session integrity in multi-WAN environments. The process involves configuring the outbound policy manager to use custom rules, where algorithms such as Weighted Balance, Persistence, Enforced, Priority, Overflow, Least Used, and Lowest Latency can be applied based on the desired outcome. For example, rules can be set to route all HTTPS traffic (TCP port 443) from a particular device or IP through a specific WAN using the Persistence or Enforced algorithm, ensuring that return traffic follows the same path and sessions remain stable (critical for services like FTP or SSL). Weighted Balance can distribute traffic proportionally to link speeds, while Priority and Overflow can ensure backup or failover behaviors. Best practices include retaining default rules like HTTPS Persistence, prioritizing rules in the correct order (top-down), and adjusting bandwidth values for each WAN to ensure algorithms function as intended. After creating or modifying rules, changes must be saved and applied. Using outbound policies in this way allows for granular traffic management, prevents session drops caused by IP changes, and ensures optimal use of available bandwidth.",
