This behavior has been observed across multiple carriers including Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile, and occurs regardless of whether the CA bands are set to Auto or manually selected. The drop in CA may be influenced by factors such as limitations of the Sierra Wireless modem or Peplink firmware, or external factors related to tower transmission. Stress tests indicate that once the CA drops to 2 bands, it does not increase beyond that level during repeated use.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe Peplink MAX BR1 Pro 5G has been certified for compatibility with AT&T's FirstNet service.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe IMEI number for the Pepwave Max BR1 mini LTEA can be found through InControl2 by clicking on details under the cellular section, as well as directly in the web admin interface under the cellular details on the main page.\n\n## Document_4\n\nTo find the IMEI number for the Pepwave Max BR1 Mini LTE-US-T, it can be located on the white sticker inside the original packaging box. Alternatively, the IMEI number can be accessed by logging into the router and navigating to the Cellular Details tab.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe Pepwave MAX Transit Duo requires a high current supply of 2.4 Amps to operate properly on USB power. If using multiple lower current supplies, it is important to utilize both USB connectors to meet the necessary power requirements.\n\n## Document_6\n\nTo activate a SIM card for a new BR1 MAX MK2, the IMEI number can be found on the device's box or obtained from the Peplink Partner from whom the device was purchased, as Peplink provides a method for Partners to look up the IMEI by serial number.\n\n## Document_7\n\nAn expired warranty on an AP managed by InControl 2 (IC2) does not affect the ability to push configurations to the AP. Users can purchase IC2 subscriptions even after the warranty period has ended to maintain management capabilities.\n\n## Document_8\n\nWhen using a 24 port switch with two power supplies, it is possible to connect each power supply to a separate UPS battery backup. However, the power usage will not be sequential; instead, it will be load shared, meaning both UPS power sources will be utilized simultaneously rather than one after the other.\n\n## Document_9\n\nTo successfully delete a VLAN network that is showing as 'Used by', it is important to check if the VLAN is set as a named VLAN on a specific physical port. Additionally, verify if a SpeedFusion Layer 2 profile is utilizing the VLAN, as this could prevent deletion.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Peplink Balance 210 supports up to 10,000 concurrent NAT sessions. For detailed specifications, it is advisable to contact a local Peplink partner.\n\n## Document_11\n\nFor the Pepwave Max BR1 Mini HW3 variant, a compatible adapter plug for the 4-pin DC power block can be found from Cradlepoint, specifically model 170665-000, which is readily available.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe new Pepwave Max BR1 Mini HW3 variant uses a 4 pin DC power block with a center pin positive configuration for the DC barrel. An adapter plug compatible with this configuration can be found on Amazon, as suggested in the conversation.\n\n## Document_13\n\nTo manage access to different SSIDs on a Pepwave Max BR1 5G, you can define a schedule and set that schedule per SSID, allowing you to turn off the personal AP during work hours when the connection is less than ideal.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo connect a Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini Cat 7 to a DC barrel connector, it is advisable to use an adapter rather than cutting or replacing the barrel connector. The power pin-outs for the Molex 4-pin adapter can be found in the user manual, which specifies which pins correspond to DC+ and DC- wires.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Winegard 360+ antenna system is not suitable for use with the Pepwave Max BR1 Pro 5G due to its insufficient number of antenna elements and its design primarily for 4G/LTE frequencies. It is recommended to use a dedicated 5G antenna, such as the Peplink 42G antenna, which is 5G ready and includes GPS and WiFi capabilities for accessing public WiFi networks.\n\n## Document_16\n\nWhen attempting to access the login page of a Peplink Max BR1 MK2 router at 192.168.50.1, it is important to verify the IP address assigned to the device connected to the LAN. If the IP address is in the range of 192.168.50.x, users should also check if the HTTPS protocol is required by trying https://192.168.50.1.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo access the login page of a Peplink Max BR1 MK2, if the standard IP address 192.168.50.1 does not respond, it may be necessary to use the reset button located in a small hole on the device to restore functionality.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Pepwave MAX BR1 router has a default IP address of 192.168.50.1 and uses DHCP to assign IP addresses to connected clients starting from 192.168.50.10. If the SAT TV device is using DHCP, it will receive a new IP address within the 192.168.50.10-100 range. If the SAT TV does not use DHCP, the BR1's network settings can be changed to use the 192.168.1.0/24 network instead of the default 192.168.50.0/24. An advanced IP scanner can be used to identify devices on the network.\n\n## Document_19\n\nIf a connection is refused when trying to access a PepLink Max BR1 router at the IP address 192.168.25.1, it is important to verify that the default IP has been changed from 192.168.50.1 to 192.168.25.1. Additionally, checking the IP address of the connected laptop or PC is crucial to ensure it is on the same subnet as the router for successful connectivity.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe Pepwave MAX BR1 Pro does not support converting the WAN port to a LAN port, which means it cannot be configured to provide additional LAN ports beyond the default number available.\n\n## Document_21\n\nIn IP passthrough mode, the Pepwave MAX BR1 will retain its default management IP address of 192.168.50.1, but it will not have an IP scheme for routing. To access the BR1 for management, a PC must be assigned a static IP address within the 192.168.50.x subnet. The Linksys router can use its default subnet for DHCP settings to facilitate communication between the devices.\n\n## Document_22\n\nFor the MAX HD2 LTE IP67, the power connector part number is ACW-636. Additionally, the PoE injector for this device has a different part number, which is ACW-107.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe default IP address for configuring the Pepwave MAX BR1 router is 192.168.50.1. To access the configuration page wirelessly, one must connect to the built-in access point (AP) of the BR1.\n\n## Document_24\n\nFor configuring multiple Pepwave Max BR1 devices, the InControl2 cloud management platform can be used to store configurations in the cloud and push them to all devices, facilitating pre-staging of configurations.\n\n## Document_25\n\nTo add users in InControl2, once a person is added, they will receive an email with a unique link. If the email is not received, the user can go to the InControl2 login page and select the 'Reset' option next to 'Forgot your password?' to receive a password reset email by entering their email address and clicking the Send button.\n\n## Document_26\n\nTo unregister a router from an InControl2 account, one should remove the device from its current group within the existing organization. After this, the router can be added to a new organization or account.\n\n## Document_27\n\nCurrently, InControl 2 (IC2) requires devices to be under warranty for management. If a device goes out of warranty, users must either renew the warranty or purchase an IC2 subscription to continue utilizing the management features. The subscription is considered affordable given the extensive capabilities that IC2 offers.\n\n## Document_28\n\nCarrier aggregation (CA) performance can vary based on the carrier's implementation rather than the limitations of the Peplink hardware or Sierra Wireless modem. In the USA, major carriers like Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile manage CA differently, which can affect the number of bands utilized. The user has observed that while they can achieve up to 5 band CA initially, it tends to drop to 2 bands after about an hour, impacting speeds. The user has not experienced CA dropping below 2 bands, and the response suggests that the carrier's management of CA may be influenced by network conditions and usage patterns.\n\n## Document_29\n\nThe Peplink MAX BR1 5G Pro supports band 14, which is used by FirstNet, suggesting potential compatibility with the network. However, it is not explicitly listed on the FirstNet page, so confirmation from Peplink support may be necessary for definitive compatibility information.\n\n## Document_30\n\nThe IMEI number for the Pepwave Max BR1 Mini LTE-US-T can be found in two locations: physically on a sticker on the bottom of the unit, where it is labeled after 'IMEA:' followed by a 15-digit number, and digitally through the device's GUI by navigating to Dashboard -> WAN Connection Status -> [name of your connection] -> Details, where it will be listed under 'WAN Connection Status.'\n\n## Document_31\n\nThe Pepwave MAX Transit Duo may not operate correctly on 5V USB power if the USB cable is faulty or if the device requires more power due to the installation of two SIM cards and the creation of a tunnel. Insufficient voltage can cause the battery light to flash red every 10 seconds, indicating a power issue.\n\n## Document_32\n\nTo activate a SIM card for a BR1 MAX MK2, the IMEI number can be found on the box rather than the device itself. If the admin password is not recognized after changing it, one option is to reset the router using a paperclip, which will allow logging back in. Alternatively, connecting a wired WAN cable and adding the device to InControl2 can bring it online.\n\n## Document_33\n\nOnce the warranty of an access point (AP) managed by IC2 expires, new configurations cannot be pushed to the device from IC2. However, the expiration of the warranty does not impact the configurations that have already been applied to the device.\n\n## Document_34\n\nTo connect a Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini Cat 7 to a pre-wired DC barrel connector in an Airstream, a specific adapter is required to convert the male barrel connector to a Molex 4-pin. The adapter can be purchased from a specified online retailer in the US.\n\n## Document_35\n\nTo access the Sat TV interface after switching to a Max BR1 router, it may be necessary to adjust the IP address settings of the Max BR1 to match the existing network configuration, specifically ensuring it is within the same subnet as the Sat TV device, which is at 192.168.1.11. Additionally, if other devices such as an access point are not accessible, their IP addresses should also be checked to ensure they are correctly configured within the network.\n\n## Document_36\n\nIf a connection is refused when trying to access a PepLink Max BR1 router at its IP address 192.168.25.1, one possible cause could be that the web admin port has been changed from the default port 80 to another port. This would result in an inability to connect using the standard URL format.\n\n## Document_37\n\nWhen attempting to connect to a PepLink Max BR1 router at the IP address 192.168.25.1, users may encounter a 'connection refused' error. Possible causes include incorrect network configuration, such as improper DNS settings or IP address conflicts. In this case, the main DNS was set to the router's IP, which could lead to issues. Additionally, while pinging the router from within the network shows some success, traceroute fails to return results, indicating potential routing issues. SSH connection attempts to port 22 also time out, suggesting that the SSH service may not be running or accessible on the router.\n\n## Document_38\n\nWhen attempting to connect to a PepLink Max BR1 router at the IP address 192.168.25.1, a connection refused error may occur. This could be due to issues with the router's configuration or network settings. The user is trying to ping the ISP allocated to the cellular modem on the BR1 and aims to remotely access a server on the LAN using SSH. It is noted that public IP addresses are being used on the cellular connection.\n\n## Document_39\n\nThe IP address 192.168.25.1 is not accessible from the outside due to being in the 100.64.0.0/10 IP address block, which is used for carrier grade NAT. To access the router from an external network, one can obtain a static public IP address from the carrier or set up a PepVPN or IPSEC connection to a router that has a public IP address.\n\n## Document_40\n\nIf a connection is refused when attempting to connect to a PepLink Max BR1 router at the IP address 192.168.25.1, one potential solution is to use the website http://whatsmyrouterip.com/ to help establish a connection through a web browser. This may assist in accessing the router's settings and performing a reset if necessary.\n\n## Document_41\n\nTo successfully connect a Pepwave MAX BR1 in bridged mode to a Linksys WRT1900ACS v2 router, it is important to disable IP forwarding on the BR1. After making this change, reboot both devices to allow the Linksys router to obtain the cellular IP address from the BR1.\n\n",

    "query": "What troubleshooting steps and considerations should a technician take when experiencing a drop in carrier aggregation (CA) bands on a Peplink MAX BR1 5G Pro or BR2 5G Pro across multiple carriers, and what factors could be responsible for this behavior?",
    "answer": "When experiencing a drop in carrier aggregation (CA) bands from a maximum of 5 bands to just 2 on Peplink MAX BR1 5G Pro or BR2 5G Pro routers—even after about an hour of use and regardless of whether bands are set to Auto or manual selection—the technician should be aware that this is a known behavior observed across major US carriers (Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile). Stress testing shows that once the CA drops to 2 bands, it does not increase again during the session. This reduction in CA is not necessarily due to Peplink firmware or Sierra Wireless modem limitations but may be primarily influenced by how the carrier manages CA in response to network conditions and usage patterns. The drop is not observed to go below 2 bands. Additionally, hardware like the MAX BR1 5G Pro supports relevant bands (e.g., band 14 for FirstNet), but for specific compatibility (such as FirstNet), confirmation with Peplink is advised. Technicians should consider both carrier-side management and hardware/firmware factors in their troubleshooting, but the most likely cause is carrier-specific CA management.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nThe maximum throughput for the Pepwave Surf SOHO T router is 120 Mbps, which explains why a speed test through the SOHO shows 95 Mbps, as it is operating within its specified limits. The difference in speed between the internet router and the SOHO is not indicative of a malfunction but rather a result of the router's maximum capacity.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 can successfully ping and trace the printer, indicating it is reachable on the network. However, the printer does not consistently appear on the client list and is unresponsive to Wake-on-LAN requests, which may suggest that the printer does not support this function. The client list may not accurately reflect all connected devices, especially if they are only communicating on the local area network without Internet access. Restarting the router temporarily allows the printer to appear on the client list, but it subsequently disappears after a few minutes, indicating potential connectivity issues.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 router is experiencing issues with a wired printer that intermittently appears on the client list but is marked as inactive. The printer can be pinged from a PC and is visible in traceroute results, but it does not respond to Wake-on-LAN requests and disappears from the client list after a few minutes. Wired PCs can print to the printer, but Wi-Fi devices, including a phone, cannot detect it. The printer lacks a web UI, and there are no VLANs configured on the network. The issue persists despite the router being powered by a UPS during a power outage, and it is suggested that pressing the router's reset button might resolve the issue.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput of 120 Mbps, which is typically measured under optimal lab conditions. Users may experience lower speeds in real-world scenarios, and if a user has upgraded their internet service to 200 Mbps but is only achieving speeds around 100 Mbps, it may be necessary to consider upgrading to a faster router to fully utilize the increased WAN speed.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe Peplink Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput of 120 Mbps, which may limit connection speeds to around 100 Mbps, even if the internet service is upgraded to 200 Mbps. For higher throughput needs, considering a Peplink Balance 20X or other devices that support closer to 200 Mbps is advisable.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput limit of 120 Mbps, which means it cannot achieve higher speeds regardless of the internet plan. For users needing higher speeds, upgrading to a more powerful unit such as the Balance One, which supports up to 600 Mbps, or the Balance 20X, which supports up to 900 Mbps, is recommended. These speeds are under optimal conditions, and actual speeds may vary based on factors like Wi-Fi signal strength and channel congestion.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe Pepwave Surf Soho MK3 Router is compatible with Spectrum, and it is advisable to minimize the hardware used from Spectrum for better performance. The Surf Soho MK3 is expected to come with the latest firmware version 8.1.1, but if it does not, the user has a downloaded version of firmware 7.1.2 that can be used for replacement. There are concerns regarding the firmware update practices of Spectrum, particularly with third-party modems like Netgear.\n\n## Document_8\n\nWhen considering extending wireless coverage with a Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3, it is confirmed that connecting two SOHOs over Ethernet to operate one as an access point (AP) is not feasible, as DHCP cannot be handled by the primary SOHO in that configuration. However, connecting an AP One Mini to the SOHO via Ethernet is possible, allowing both devices to be configured with the same SSIDs and passwords, enabling seamless connectivity for devices transitioning between the two based on signal strength.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe Pepwave SOHO router has a combined bandwidth limit of 120Mbps for both upload and download speeds. This means that users can expect speeds around 70Mbps down and 50Mbps up, which aligns with the observed performance during speed tests.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Peplink Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput specification of 120 Mbps, which explains why the speed at the workstation via network cable is lower than the modem test speed of 350 Mbps. Users should refer to Peplink's website for detailed specifications regarding the device's performance limits.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Surf SOHO router has a WAN port and LAN ports that support speeds of 1000Mbps; however, its throughput is limited to 100-120Mbps. This means that while the physical ports can handle high-speed connections, the router's processing capacity restricts the actual data transmission rate to a maximum of 120Mbps, which aligns with the specifications provided in the Surf SOHO spec sheet.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe Surf SOHO router supports Gigabit Ethernet on the LAN side, but it is limited to a maximum Internet connection speed of 100Mbps. This means that while the LAN ports can handle Gigabit speeds, the overall Internet throughput is capped at 100Mbps.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe throughput of a Pepwave Surf SOHO router can be influenced by several factors including the number of configured rules and the use of special features. Peplink tends to be conservative in their bandwidth specifications. WiFi performance can vary significantly due to factors such as frequency band, channel interference, signal strength, channel width, number of streams, and the WiFi generation of both the router and the client device.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput of 120 Mbps, which is significantly lower than the gigabit speeds available from fiber optic connections. Users may experience lower speeds on different connection types, such as 190 Mbps on a gigabit Ethernet USB dongle and 45 Mbps on 5GHz WiFi, indicating that the router's limitations are affecting overall performance.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 has a specified throughput capability of 120 Mbps. Users may experience lower speeds when connected through the router compared to a direct connection to the modem, which can be attributed to the router's limitations.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 may not be able to handle the upgraded internet speed of 400 Mbps, as indicated by the user's experience of only achieving 110 Mbps when connected through the router. Other models, such as the Balance One Core and three additional models, support throughput ranging from 350 to 600 Mbps, which may be more suitable for higher speed internet connections.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 can be configured to use a different subnet, such as a /23, which allows for up to 510 device IPs. This configuration can support a larger number of devices compared to the default DHCP settings. However, managing 250 devices on the SOHO may depend on the required bandwidth and the number of sessions that need to be supported.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe throughput rating of the Pepwave Surf SOHO (MK3) at 120 Mbps is determined by the hardware capabilities of the device, rather than being artificially limited by software. Future models are expected to have higher throughput due to the use of more powerful internal components, which may also result in an increase in selling price.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 has a rated WAN throughput of 120Mbps, which can lead to reduced speeds based on network traffic and router load. For users requiring higher throughput, the Balance One with WiFi is recommended as a more suitable device for high-speed connections.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe throughput of the Pepwave SOHO MK 3 router is rated at 120Mbps, which means that regardless of the ISP plan providing 1Gbps, the maximum internet speed available to clients connected to the router will be limited to 120Mbps due to the router's specifications.\n\n## Document_21\n\nFor tethering with the Pepwave Surf, users should refer to the full list of currently supported modems available on the Peplink website. If a modem is unsupported, there are steps provided for users to follow, which may lead to engineering creating drivers for that modem.\n\n## Document_22\n\nThe Surf SOHO router has a maximum throughput of 100 Mbps and is designed primarily for residential applications. It features one Ethernet WAN port, which limits its capability for failover to a second Ethernet WAN connection. For setups requiring support for more than 15 devices, such as 30 devices in this case, it may be advisable to consider the Balance 20 or higher for better performance and reliability.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe Peplink Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput of around 120 Mbps, which may not be sufficient for high-speed internet plans like 1000 Mbps. Users experiencing buffering issues while streaming may need to consider upgrading to a different router that can handle higher speeds, as the current setup may not be compatible with the desired internet performance.\n\n## Document_24\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 Router is compatible with Spectrum as long as it is connected to a standards-compliant Ethernet WAN port. A common configuration involves connecting the internet to Spectrum, then to a cable modem, and finally to the Surf SOHO. It is recommended to use a personal cable modem instead of a gateway provided by Spectrum for better implementation. Firmware version 7.1.2 is stable, and version 8.0.2 has also shown good results with Peplink products.\n\n## Document_25\n\nThe Pepwave Surf Soho MK3 Router can work with Spectrum, but it is suggested to use firmware 7.1.2 due to reported bugs in firmware 8. Users have experienced sluggish performance with firmware 8 on the Surf SOHO, and it is recommended to avoid new software until after the first couple of bug fix releases. The Surf SOHO is considered a low-end device, and may struggle with more than 20 connected devices. Additionally, using third-party modems like Netgear with Spectrum is advised, as Spectrum's firmware updates for their hardware can be unreliable.\n\n## Document_26\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 and the AP One Mini can be used together to improve wireless coverage. When connecting two SOHOs over Ethernet, it is possible to configure one SOHO to operate solely as an access point (AP), with DHCP managed by the primary SOHO, allowing devices connected to the secondary SOHO to be on the same VLAN and subnet. Additionally, when connecting an AP One Mini to the SOHO via Ethernet, both devices can be configured to use the same SSIDs and passwords for seamless connectivity, although ensuring the SSID appears only once may require specific channel configurations.\n\n## Document_27\n\nThe Surf SOHO has a WAN port and LAN ports that support 1000Mbps, but the overall router throughput is limited to 100-120Mbps due to a balance of hardware and software capabilities. While LAN port speeds allow for fast file transfers between connected devices, this does not affect the routing throughput, which is a separate function from switching capabilities.\n\n## Document_28\n\nThe Surf SOHO has a WAN port and four LAN ports that support 1000Mbps, but the router's throughput is limited to 100-120Mbps. This limitation affects the total throughput of the device, meaning that while the hardware can handle higher speeds, the actual data transfer rate is capped by the router's processing capabilities, which may lead to underutilization of higher-speed internet connections.\n\n## Document_29\n\nThe Surf SOHO router supports Gigabit Ethernet speeds, but due to a user interface bug, the option for 1000Mbps is not displayed in the drop-down list; users should select the Auto option to utilize Gigabit speeds. This issue is acknowledged and will be addressed in a future update.\n\n## Document_30\n\nThe Surf SOHO router, specifically Hardware Revision 2, has a maximum throughput of 100Mbps for Internet bandwidth, which may lead to confusion regarding its Ethernet port speeds. While the router supports Gigabit Ethernet, the actual Internet bandwidth throughput is limited to 100Mbps.\n\n## Document_31\n\nThe current version of the Pepwave Surf SOHO has a maximum router throughput of 120 Mbps, which explains the lower speed test results observed when connected to a fiber optic connection. Users should not expect to achieve gigabit speeds with this device, as its specifications limit the throughput significantly below that level.\n\n## Document_32\n\nThe recommended user capacity for the Peplink Balance 20/30 and Surf SOHO devices is about 25 users simultaneously, with a maximum throughput of 100Mbps. The Surf SOHO is a fail-over only device, allowing only one active connection at a time, while the Balance series supports multiple connections and load balancing. For scenarios involving growth and higher demand, it is advisable to consider the Balance 210/310 or Balance 305 models, which can accommodate future needs more effectively.\n\n",

      "The Surf SOHO has a WAN port and LAN ports that support 1000Mbps, but the overall router throughput is limited to 100-120Mbps due to a balance of hardware and software capabilities. While LAN port speeds allow for fast file transfers between connected devices, this does not affect the routing throughput, which is a separate function from switching capabilities.",
      "The Surf SOHO has a WAN port and four LAN ports that support 1000Mbps, but the router's throughput is limited to 100-120Mbps. This limitation affects the total throughput of the device, meaning that while the hardware can handle higher speeds, the actual data transfer rate is capped by the router's processing capabilities, which may lead to underutilization of higher-speed internet connections.",
      "The Surf SOHO router supports Gigabit Ethernet speeds, but due to a user interface bug, the option for 1000Mbps is not displayed in the drop-down list; users should select the Auto option to utilize Gigabit speeds. This issue is acknowledged and will be addressed in a future update.",
      "The Surf SOHO router, specifically Hardware Revision 2, has a maximum throughput of 100Mbps for Internet bandwidth, which may lead to confusion regarding its Ethernet port speeds. While the router supports Gigabit Ethernet, the actual Internet bandwidth throughput is limited to 100Mbps.",
      "The current version of the Pepwave Surf SOHO has a maximum router throughput of 120 Mbps, which explains the lower speed test results observed when connected to a fiber optic connection. Users should not expect to achieve gigabit speeds with this device, as its specifications limit the throughput significantly below that level.",
      "The recommended user capacity for the Peplink Balance 20/30 and Surf SOHO devices is about 25 users simultaneously, with a maximum throughput of 100Mbps. The Surf SOHO is a fail-over only device, allowing only one active connection at a time, while the Balance series supports multiple connections and load balancing. For scenarios involving growth and higher demand, it is advisable to consider the Balance 210/310 or Balance 305 models, which can accommodate future needs more effectively."

    "query": "How does the Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3's throughput limitation affect users upgrading to high-speed internet plans (e.g., 200 Mbps or higher), and what alternative router models are recommended for users needing higher throughput?",
    "answer": "The Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 router has a maximum WAN throughput of 120 Mbps, which is a hardware limitation. This means that even if a user upgrades their internet plan to 200 Mbps, 400 Mbps, or even 1 Gbps, the router will only deliver up to 120 Mbps to connected devices. Users may see actual speeds lower than this depending on real-world conditions and router load. The router's LAN and WAN ports support Gigabit Ethernet (1000 Mbps), but the routing throughput is capped by the device's processing capabilities, which leads to underutilization of higher-speed internet connections. For those needing to fully utilize higher-speed plans, upgrading to a more powerful router is necessary. Recommended alternatives include the Peplink Balance One (up to 600 Mbps), Peplink Balance 20X (up to 900 Mbps), and Balance One Core (350–600 Mbps), which are better suited for high-speed internet and larger user capacity.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nTo configure the GPIO interface on Peplink routers, users can refer to the Router API documentation available from Peplink. The documentation provides commands for querying the status of GPIO pins, although specific commands were not detailed in the conversation. Additionally, there is a possibility to query the power supply input voltage via the API, but further specifics were not provided in the response.\n\n## Document_2\n\nTo reset the password on a Peplink device, smaller models typically have a reset button located in a hole that requires a paperclip to access. Larger models may feature an LCD with buttons for resetting.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe maximum MTU sizes supported on Peplink routers are as follows: Wired WAN has a maximum MTU of 1440 bytes, Cellular WAN has 1428 bytes, Mobile Internet supports 1492 bytes, and Wifi WAN has a maximum MTU of 1500 bytes.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe GPS route history for devices using the PepLink API is retained for a period of 1 year.\n\n## Document_5\n\nTo change the master and slave roles in a 1+1 Backup High Availability pair without shutting down the master device, the following steps should be followed: First, log into the Master Device and uncheck 'Resume Master Role after Recovery' in the settings under high availability. Then, reboot the Master Device. Next, log into the previously Slave device, which will now assume the master role, and disable sync configuration. Set the preferred HA role as master. After that, log into the previously Master device, which will now be the slave, and set its preferred HA role as slave, entering the serial number of the new master device. Finally, reboot the slave device to complete the process.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe issue of a unit restarting multiple times may be related to changes made to outbound policy rules, particularly when switching the order of WAN connections, such as changing from WAN4 to WAN2. This problem reportedly began after upgrading to the latest firmware, suggesting a potential compatibility or stability issue with the new firmware when modifying outbound policies.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe ports in question are Micro USB ports, not USB-C, and are used solely for powering the device from a power brick during portable testing. These ports are wired only to the DC power bus and do not support data transmission, meaning they cannot be used to connect a Max Adapter or add another cellular modem.\n\n## Document_8\n\nLayer 2 VPN profiles can only include one VLAN or LAN segment on each device, meaning that a single profile cannot be shared across multiple VLANs.\n\n## Document_9\n\nTo resolve the issue of a Pepwave device being registered to another organization in InControl, it is necessary to open a support ticket with Peplink. The support team will require a diagnostic report from the device and a picture showing the silver label as proof of ownership.\n\n## Document_10\n\nIn the context of DHCP, the process involves DORA (Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge), where a client obtains an IP address. During the Discover and Request stages, clients send options to the DHCP server. The Peplink DHCP server will send all configured options during both the Offer and Acknowledge phases. A DHCP NACK (Negative Acknowledgment) is sent by the Peplink DHCP server only if it refuses to lease the requested IP address to the client.\n\n## Document_11\n\nOn 24 May 2023, a maintenance fix was deployed to all InControl \"planets\" simultaneously, leading to an overload of the device communication cluster due to a high volume of incoming report data. This caused devices to initiate re-authentication, but the cluster was unable to process all requests in time, resulting in devices being incorrectly treated as offline. The system ceased requesting report data at 00:30, allowing the cluster load to decrease and re-authentication requests to be processed gradually. By 01:45, all devices were back online. To prevent future occurrences, fixes will be applied to only one planet at a time, additional resources have been added to the communications cluster, and the system will stop identifying devices as offline during high authentication volumes to avoid false alarms.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo delete an organization in InControl that was created with a personal email and is empty of devices, log in using that email, navigate to Organization Settings, and delete all devices on the device management page. The organization will be removed automatically after 28 days.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe InControl 2 Mars and Earth systems will undergo scheduled maintenance on November 14 and 28, 2022, at 00:30 GMT+0, lasting 60 minutes each, during which access to the system, Find My Peplink service, and captive portals may be less responsive or intermittently unavailable. The systems will be upgraded to version 2.12.0. The maintenance for the Earth system has been rescheduled to November 28 due to a potential performance issue identified in the release, and no maintenance was carried out on November 21.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe IC2 platform allows for tracking data usage by IMSI or ICCID per SIM card or across groups of SIMs when using Data pools from MVNOs. Partners have successfully built in-house systems utilizing the IC2 API to extract necessary data for monitoring and reporting purposes.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe InControl 2 Mars system will be upgraded to version 2.9.2 on September 27, 2021, at 00:30 GMT+0, with scheduled maintenance lasting 60 minutes. During this time, access to the system, Find My Peplink service, and captive portals may be less responsive or intermittently unavailable. The WAN quality reports in version 2.9.2 are noted to be easier to read, with improved chart intelligibility and hover functionality.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe InControl Mars and Mercury systems are undergoing scheduled maintenance on June 9, 2021, at 00:30 GMT+0, lasting 60 minutes. During this time, access to the systems and captive portals may be less responsive or intermittently unavailable. The upgrade will merge the Mercury system into Mars, with organizations on Mercury appearing on Mars after the upgrade.\n\n## Document_17\n\nInControl version 2.8.6 was deployed to the Mercury system, during which an issue with PepVPN configuration was identified. However, due to a configuration protection mechanism, no impact was made to any devices. The deployment to the Mars system has been postponed to September 8 at 00:30 GMT+0.\n\n## Document_18\n\nCurrently, there is no report available that shows SIM ID, IMEI, and MDN together for data usage. However, there is a SIM data usage export tool under 'Sim Pool Reports' that is IMSI based. Additionally, SIM usage data can be accessed through Peplink's API services, which also operates on an IMSI basis, with endpoints available for hourly, daily, and monthly SIM usages.\n\n## Document_19\n\nDocumentation and tutorials for InControl 2, including information on the Ads module and advertisement reports, can be found at the Ad Delivery Service Portal and the Ad Delivery Service Evaluation Guide. These resources provide insights into the capabilities of the Ads module and the types of reports available.\n\n## Document_20\n\nAfter scheduled maintenance on April 16 at 03:00 GMT+0, some Peplink and Pepwave client units were reported offline in IC2, affecting the Captive Portal functionality. Service was restored at 04:30 GMT+0.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo add users in InControl2, once a person is added, they will receive an email with a unique link. If the email is not received, the user can go to the InControl2 login page and select the 'Reset' option next to 'Forgot your password?' to receive a password reset email by entering their email address and clicking the Send button.\n\n## Document_22\n\nTo set up email notifications for WAN connection status on a Peplink Balance, users can navigate to Group > Settings > Notifications to create multiple notification profiles for various purposes. This allows for more reliable notification management compared to using the CE device for sending alerts.\n\n## Document_23\n\nTo move a device from one group to another within InControl, navigate to the Group Dashboard page, click on Manage, select the device by ticking the corresponding box, and then use the Actions pull-down menu to select Move.\n\n## Document_24\n\nCurrently, InControl 2 (IC2) requires devices to be under warranty for management. If a device goes out of warranty, users must either renew the warranty or purchase an IC2 subscription to continue utilizing the management features. The subscription is considered affordable given the extensive capabilities that IC2 offers.\n\n## Document_25\n\nTo query the status of a GPIO pin on Peplink routers, you can use the API endpoint 'https://192.168.50.1/api/status.gpio.input?list', which returns the status including voltage and type of the GPIO pin. For example, the response indicates the voltage level and whether the GPIO is enabled. This allows for monitoring the input voltage of the router.\n\n## Document_26\n\nTo change the Master and Slave roles in a 1+1 Backup High Availability pair, the following steps should be followed: log into the Master device and uncheck 'Resume Master Role after Recovery' in the High Availability settings, then reboot the Master device. Next, log into the previously Slave device, disable configuration sync, set its preferred HA role to Master, and then log into the previously Master device to set its preferred HA role to Slave, entering the serial number of the new Master device. Finally, reboot the Slave device. This procedure allows for a successful role change without issues, provided both devices are connected to the same switch.\n\n## Document_27\n\nThe Balance 710 HW1 experiences issues where it loses outbound WAN connection upon saving changes made to the unit. This problem occurs not only when changing outbound policies but also when modifications are made in the firewall section and inbound access services section. After applying changes, the unit may restart or fail to accept outbound/inbound WAN connections.\n\n## Document_28\n\nThe Peplink BA310v2 experienced spontaneous restarts, which were suspected to be hardware related. After replacing the original power supply unit (PSU) with a different make and model, the reboot issues were resolved. When replacing a PSU, it is crucial to ensure that the voltage is identical, the polarity matches, and that the PSU can supply sufficient power to avoid damage or stability issues.\n\n## Document_29\n\nTo inform DHCP clients that they are on a metered connection, one approach involves using DHCP option 43, which can be configured on Peplink routers. Additionally, Windows may utilize vendor extensions to convey network cost information through a specific packet format, where the cost level indicates the type of connection (e.g., unrestricted, fixed, variable) and cost flags provide details about usage conditions (e.g., over data limit, congested, roaming).\n\n## Document_30\n\nIn Peplink routers, while it is possible to set various DHCP options, including option 43, there is no configuration option available to force the sending of option 43 in DHCP replies without it being specifically requested by the client. This behavior is noted as potentially necessary for clients to recognize a connection as metered, similar to how Android devices handle metered connections. However, testing indicates that simply setting option 43 does not achieve the desired outcome of clients automatically recognizing the connection as metered, suggesting that a more complex or vendor-specific approach may be required.\n\n## Document_31\n\nOn January 2, 2024, the InControl system experienced an issue where many devices were falsely marked as offline due to a system component generating high CPU load on a memory database, which became overloaded. The issue was resolved by 07:12 UTC, with devices gradually appearing online again, and the system was fully recovered by 07:48 UTC.\n\n## Document_32\n\nFollowing the scheduled maintenance of the InControl 2 Mars system on September 27, 2021, users reported that Device Reports were missing most data on all units, and MediaFast Reports did not function with the SDX Pro.\n\n",

    "query": "How can a technician monitor and interpret the power supply input voltage and GPIO status on a Peplink router, and what steps should they take if voltage-related instability or restarts occur?",
    "answer": "A technician can monitor the power supply input voltage and GPIO status on a Peplink router by using the Router API. The API provides endpoints (such as '/api/status.gpio.input?list') that return the voltage and status (including type and enabled state) of GPIO pins, allowing the technician to check the input voltage remotely. If the router experiences instability or restarts that are suspected to be related to the power supply, the technician should ensure that any replacement power supply matches the required voltage and polarity, and that it can supply sufficient power. Using a power supply with incorrect voltage, polarity, or insufficient current capacity can cause reboot issues or damage the unit. Therefore, proper monitoring and correct PSU selection are both critical for stable operation.",

This capability can assist in identifying users engaging in specific activities, such as BitTorrent downloads, although the response does not explicitly confirm the ability to block such traffic.\n\n## Document_7\n\nTo resolve the issue of Peplink routers being unable to send emails through Google GMail services due to the disabling of less secure mail clients, users can generate an app password in their Google account. This app password should then be used as the credentials in the Peplink email settings to enable email alerts and text messages from the routers.\n\n## Document_8\n\nWhen using a Peplink ONE, if the health-check reports 'down', the route to the provider router is deleted, preventing access. To resolve this, an enforced route for that network should be added to the WAN port to maintain connectivity even when the health-check fails.\n\n## Document_9\n\nTo troubleshoot connection issues with an IPSec VPN setup between a Peplink device and a Fortigate, it is important to verify NAT policies applied to the IPSec VPN profile. Although the connection is established, if pings cannot be sent from the Peplink side to the vendor's network, further investigation is needed. Providing a traceroute result from the Peplink LAN to the Fortigate LAN, along with the source and destination subnets, can assist in diagnosing the problem.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo configure two active VPN profiles on a Pepwave MAX700 connected to two data centers, it is necessary to adjust the cost of the PepVPN profile for the second data center from the default value of 10 to a higher number, such as 20. This adjustment allows for the establishment of both VPN connections, enabling an active/stand-by configuration.\n\n## Document_11\n\nVersion 7.0.2 includes a fix for the IPSec VPN tunnel issue that was present in version 7.0.1, which required a special firmware to address.\n\n## Document_12\n\nIn a network design where a PepVPN client traffic is forwarded through a firewall, there may be issues accessing devices within an IPSec tunnel if the Balance router recognizes the destination IP range as part of that tunnel. Adding a 0.0.0.0 route to the firewall is intended to forward all PepVPN traffic, but exceptions may occur if the destination is within the IP range of an existing IPSec tunnel, potentially preventing the firewall from seeing that traffic.\n\n## Document_13\n\nTo set up an IPSEC VPN on a Pepwave device, GRE must be enabled through the device's management interface. The tunnel destination on the Cisco router should be configured to the WAN IP of the Pepwave device. Additionally, the GRE configuration must be properly set up to facilitate the VPN connection.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe Peplink One is a sealed unit and does not support external antenna attachments. A triple-WAN gateway like the Peplink Balance One requires a connection to a cable modem and cannot eliminate the need for network cables, regardless of its placement in the house. Power over Ethernet (PoE) may be a consideration for simplifying power requirements when adding additional access points.\n\n## Document_15\n\nIt is not possible to convert a configuration backup file from a Pepwave B710 to upload it to a Pepwave B300.\n\n## Document_16\n\nFor connecting antennas to a Pepwave router, it is recommended to use either Cellular 1 (1A-1D) or Cellular 2 (2A-2D) for the four antenna connections, rather than splitting them across both cellular inputs. The successful connection configuration involves connecting antenna 1 to port A, antenna 2 to port C, antenna 3 to port B, and antenna 4 to port D on the router.\n\n## Document_17\n\nModels with LTE-A Category 6 support are expected to be available in 4-6 weeks.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe MAX series routers can support two IPsec VPN tunnels.\n\n## Document_19\n\nTo create more than two IPSEC VPN links from a PepWave Max700 device, an additional PepVPN license is required. This license can be purchased from a Peplink Partner or through the Peplink Store.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe modem compatibility list for currently supported Pepwave products, such as the MAX 700 and MAX OTG, does not apply to legacy products like the MAX 600. While there is a possibility that a newer LTE modem could work with older models, it is unlikely.\n\n## Document_21\n\nThe Pepwave Max 600 is currently working on supporting LTE functionality with the U313 modem, which is not yet available but is in development.\n\n## Document_22\n\nWhen using VLAN pooling on Peplink AP products, clients are randomly assigned to one of the available VLAN pools, which helps ensure an even distribution of clients across all configured VLANs. This means that if multiple /24 VLANs are set up, the AP will allocate IP addresses to clients in a manner that balances the load across the VLANs in the pool.\n\n## Document_23\n\nTo bond multiple SIMs together in a Pepwave MAX-HD2 or MAX-HD4 for a single fast connection, a SpeedFusion Bonding license is required. However, the HD series devices come with the SpeedFusion Bonding license included. Product comparison pages provide information on which SpeedFusion features are supported natively and which require additional licensing or subscriptions.\n\n## Document_24\n\nSpeedFusion Cloud connections are unencrypted by default to maximize throughput, as enabling encryption requires additional hardware resources. This may explain why the InControl interface indicates that the link is insecure, especially if no devices have been connected yet.\n\n## Document_25\n\nTo access a Peplink switch that is offline in INcontrol, it may be possible to use INTouch on the 20X router to connect to the LAN side IP of the switch. Additionally, changing the switch settings to auto for INcontrol instead of using a specific VLAN can help resolve connectivity issues with INcontrol.\n\n## Document_26\n\nTo resolve issues with establishing a SpeedFusion tunnel on a Pepwave MAX BR2, ensure that UDP port 4500 is open in the AWS security group and allowed in the BR2's WAN network. If problems persist, consider trying a different UDP port and adding that port to the AWS security group as well.\n\n## Document_27\n\nThe Peplink B-One router offers superior remote administration capabilities and a wider range of features compared to the Orbi system. The built-in WiFi of the Peplink B-One has been reported to perform exceptionally well, making it a strong contender for home office use, especially when managing multiple devices such as servers, workstations, phones, tablets, and IoT devices.\n\n## Document_28\n\nThe performance of 4G and 5G speeds on the Pepwave 310X can be influenced by various factors including the time of day, geographical location, the level of 5G support in that area, the type of antennas used (indoor vs outdoor), and the specific configuration of the 310X device. In some locations, 5G may have limited support, resulting in speeds that do not surpass those of 4G. Testing with a 5G enabled phone in the intended usage area can provide a better estimate of expected speeds.\n\n## Document_29\n\nThe Peplink ONE allows users to view MAC addresses of connected devices and monitor active sessions under the Status > Active Sessions section. Additionally, there are guides available for blocking BitTorrent traffic, which can help in managing unauthorized downloads within a network.\n\n## Document_30\n\nWith a Pepwave device, it is possible to see the MAC addresses of users connected to the network and to block BitTorrent traffic using the Content Blocking feature.\n\n## Document_31\n\nUsing a Peplink device, it is possible to implement content filtering to block BitTorrent users, which can help reduce network data usage and demonstrate compliance with legal usage. This setup allows for fair usage among all users in a network, and it can assist in managing network activity effectively.\n\n## Document_32\n\nA Peplink ONE device can be used to monitor network activity, including the ability to see MAC addresses of connected users. It is possible to block BitTorrent traffic, which can help prevent copyright infringement issues. However, the ability to view MAC addresses and user activity prior to blocking specific traffic depends on the configuration and capabilities of the Peplink device in use.\n\n## Document_33\n\nA Peplink router can be used to manage internet access in a mobile home park, including the ability to set up a Captive Portal for user authentication and data management. This can help in identifying users and controlling access. Content filtering features can also be utilized to block specific applications like BitTorrent. However, tracking MAC addresses and user activity may require ongoing administrative effort, especially as users change devices. Keeping the router firmware updated is recommended for optimal performance.\n\n## Document_34\n\nA Peplink device can provide visibility into the MAC addresses of devices connected to its network, including those behind a Ubiquiti Nano Station that is rebroadcasting the Wi-Fi signal. However, the ability to block BitTorrent traffic specifically may depend on the capabilities of the Peplink device and its configuration. To monitor traffic and potentially block specific users, the MAC address of the Ubiquiti Nano Station may need to be added to the Peplink controller for proper management and oversight of the network traffic.\n\n## Document_35\n\nTo monitor individual user activity and MAC addresses in a network setup, the device should be configured in station (Bridge) mode. In this mode, individual IP and MAC addresses can be seen. However, if the device is in routed (NAT) mode, only the traffic from a single IP and MAC address belonging to the WAN of the device will be visible, limiting visibility into individual user activity.\n\n## Document_36\n\nTo send emails from Peplink routers after Google disabled support for less secure mail clients, one option is to use the restricted domain aspmx.l.google.com on port 25 for SMTP, specifically if emailing within your own domain.\n\n## Document_37\n\nWhen using a Pepwave Balance router with both PepVPN and IPSec tunnels, traffic destined for devices inside the IPSec VPN may not be seen by the firewall due to the expected behavior of interbranch communication. Even with a static route configured for 0.0.0.0/0, the Balance router does not forward this traffic to another hop. The number of SpeedFusion and IPSec peers connected to the Balance 580 may influence potential alternative solutions.\n\n## Document_38\n\nThe provided configuration is for setting up a GRE tunnel with IP address 34.184.253.169 and a corresponding loopback IP address of 34.184.255.45. The configuration includes settings for the tunnel interface, such as MTU size, TCP MSS adjustment, and keepalive settings. Additionally, it specifies a crypto map for IPsec with a transform set of 3DES-SHA, and includes access control lists to permit GRE traffic between specified hosts. However, there is no IPSec phase 1 proposal included in the configuration, which is necessary for establishing an IPSec tunnel.\n\n## Document_39\n\nPeplink will soon support LTE-A Category 6 LTE. Additionally, Peplink routers have the capability to automatically switch cellular carriers when a new SIM card is inserted, provided the correct model is chosen based on the region (US or Europe/International) for the SIM card.\n\n## Document_40\n\nPeplink is expected to have general availability of LTE-A Category 6 capabilities and automatic cellular carrier switching by January or the first quarter of the upcoming year. Currently, they are working with partners for early customer shipments.\n\n## Document_41\n\nPeplink is expected to release LTE-A capabilities for most of its major product lines, including the BR1, Transit, HD2, and HD4 models. However, the conversation does not provide specific details about automatic cellular carrier switching or the method of manually flashing firmware for carrier changes.\n\n",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nTo create a VPN connection between two Peplink units, such as the BPL 305 and BPL 310, it is important to refer to the user manual for detailed instructions. Additionally, if there is a router or firewall in front of the Peplink devices, port forwarding must be configured for the default protocols TCP 32015 and UDP 4500 to ensure proper connectivity.\n\n## Document_2\n\nTo create a VPN connection between two Peplink units, specifically the BPL 305 and BPL 310, users can refer to the Balance and MediaFast User Manual for Firmware 7, which is available for download on the Peplink website under the Support section.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe Max HotSpot supports Virtual WAN (VWAN) as it is compatible with firmware version 8.3, which includes this feature.\n\n## Document_4\n\nPeplink devices currently have limited IPv6 support, primarily allowing basic pass-through of IPv6 traffic from the WAN to the LAN without advanced configuration options. Users can enable IPv6 support on the WAN side, but there is no control over IPv6 traffic routing, LAN configuration, or firewall settings. Additionally, PepVPN does not support native IPv6. While enabling IPv6 may allow devices to access it, this can lead to issues where devices prefer IPv6 over IPv4, potentially bypassing Peplink's traffic control features for services like Google and Netflix.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe Peplink Balance 380 supports up to 50 L2TP users in a VPN Site-Client scheme, while the Balance 710 supports up to 200 L2TP users.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Peplink B-380 with firmware version 8.0.1 has implemented features that may resolve issues related to establishing GRE tunnels when a Peplink device is included in the network. The previous configuration required for GRE tunnels may no longer be necessary with this updated firmware.\n\n## Document_7\n\nFor load balancing with different WAN technologies such as DSL, Fiber, and Vsat, with a throughput requirement of more than 2GB, the Peplink BPL-710 or BPL-1350 Max models are suitable options. These models support NAT for all WAN ports and can reroute traffic from a congested or failed link to other WAN links with different NAT configurations. However, specific information regarding failover for WAN links and NAT resolution for users when one of the WAN links goes down is not provided.\n\n## Document_8\n\nFor Peplink B2500, NAT loopback functionality is available without requiring additional configuration, provided that proper inbound NAT rules are defined. This allows devices on the local network to access services using the public IP address of the router.\n\n## Document_9\n\nPeplink devices support IPv6 passthrough, which can be enabled in the WAN settings. For this feature to work, the WAN router must respond to Stateless Address Autoconfiguration advertisements and DHCPv6 requests. IPv6 clients on the LAN will obtain their IPv6 addresses, gateway, and DNS server addresses from the router, and the device will also acquire an IPv6 address for ping/traceroute checks and web admin access.\n\n## Document_10\n\nPeplink devices support IPv6 in pass-through mode, which allows IPv6 traffic to pass from the LAN to the WAN. However, Peplink does not handle IP address assignment or routing for IPv6; this must be managed by the IPv6 device connected to the WAN.\n\n## Document_11\n\nFor a High Availability (HA) setup with Peplink routers, it is necessary to use the same model for the failover configuration. This means that a BPL-380 or BPL-580 should not be paired with a smaller model like the BPL-210 for failover purposes.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe Balance routers BPL-310, BPL-380, and BPL-580 are supported by InControl2, allowing for remote management. To manage these routers remotely, it is necessary to register them in InControl2 and ensure that the WAN connection method is correctly configured using default settings for optimal functionality.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Peplink BPL 210 and BPL 30 can establish a site-to-site VPN, indicated by a green VPN icon, allowing successful pings between the routers' LAN IPs. However, issues arise when attempting to ping hosts within the respective networks, suggesting potential configuration problems related to LAN subnets, VLANs, or WAN connections.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo resolve issues with pinging hosts across a site-to-site VPN between two Peplink devices (BPL 210 and BPL 30), it is necessary to adjust the firewall settings. By default, the firewall may block traffic, so an inbound rule should be added to allow traffic from the LAN (e.g., 192.168.0.0/24) to any destination. This rule needs to be configured on both devices to enable communication between the networks.\n\n## Document_15\n\nWhen using a Peplink B580 for load balancing in a WISP setup, issues with IPTV may arise, particularly with the RTP protocol. The user reports that IPTV worked well with a previous TP-Link balancer under the same configuration, suggesting that the Peplink device may be interfering with RTP traffic, which is essential for IPTV functionality. The setup involves routing internet through the Peplink B580 to the IPTV service, but it fails to function correctly.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo issue public IPs to clients using a Peplink router, it is important to configure the router to allow the billing gateway to handle 1:1 NAT. If the internet fails on WAN1, the public IPs on the LAN will NAT to the public IPs on WAN2. However, IP forwarding cannot be used on more than one WAN with public IPs. Load balancing and failover can be managed through outbound policy rules in the Peplink Balance router.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo address the issue of not being able to view Active Sessions on a PepLink 310 after a hard reboot, it is recommended to ensure that the device is running the most current firmware version 5.4.9. If the problem persists, opening a support ticket with Peplink is advisable for further assistance. Additionally, if Internet Explorer is being used as the web browser, switching to Firefox or Chrome may resolve the issue.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Peplink Balance models and Pepwave MAX 700 support IPv6 on a single Ethernet WAN port. When IPv6 support is enabled on a WAN, the WAN router must respond to Stateless Address Autoconfiguration advertisements and DHCPv6 requests. IPv6 clients on the LAN side will obtain their IPv6 address, gateway, and DNS server addresses from the router, which will also acquire an IPv6 address for ping/traceroute checks and web admin access.\n\n## Document_19\n\nPeplink devices have supported IPv6 since firmware version 5.4. The current implementation allows IPv6 support on one of the Ethernet WAN ports, requiring the connected router to respond to Stateless Address Auto Configuration advertisements and DHCPv6 requests. IPv6 clients on the Peplink LAN can acquire their IPv6 addresses, gateway, and DNS server addresses from the WAN. Additionally, the device can obtain an IPv6 address for ping/traceroute checks and web admin access. For devices out of warranty, users can upgrade to the latest firmware for IPv6 support by contacting their local distributor or Peplink directly to discuss warranty extension options if the device is in good condition.\n\n## Document_20\n\nPeplink devices that have an embedded cellular modem support IPv6 WAN IP with cellular service providers, allowing users to utilize IPv6 addresses for their internet connectivity needs.\n\n## Document_21\n\nPeplink routers currently have limited support for IPv6, specifically on Balance-series routers where IPv6 can be enabled under Network>WAN settings. This allows the router to respond to Stateless Address Autoconfiguration advertisements and DHCPv6 requests, enabling IPv6 clients on the LAN to acquire necessary addresses. However, this feature is not available on non-Balance routers like the MAX-series BR1. Future firmware updates, specifically version 9, are expected to improve IPv6 support.\n\n## Document_22\n\nWhen using a Peplink Balance 20X with Starlink, enabling IPv6 support in the WAN configuration may lead to MAC address conflicts, as experienced by some users. In one case, the conflicts were resolved by completely disabling IPv6, which was initially running with default settings. After disabling IPv6, the issue did not return for over a month.\n\n## Document_23\n\nTo configure a Peplink router to issue public IPs to clients, the upstream provider must route a network of public IPs to the Peplink device, which should be set with a public IP address on WAN1 and a /30 subnet mask. The Peplink's LAN must also be in the public IP network, using one of the public IPs for its LAN interface. The DHCP server on the Peplink can then distribute the remaining public IP addresses to the billing gateway. Enabling IP forwarding on WAN1 ensures that public IP addresses from the billing gateway are sent out without NAT, maintaining their original public IPs, while traffic going out through other WANs will be NATed.\n\n## Document_24\n\nPeplink devices currently do not fully support IPv6, and the implementation of full support will occur in phases. Users are advised to continue using IPv4 addresses for the time being.\n\n## Document_25\n\nTo configure a Gateway/Router, specifically the BR1, for dual stack operation with T-Mobile Internet at Home, it is possible to set up the WAN link to use IPv6 while having the capability to fail back to IPv4 if issues arise. There is a mention of T-Mobile being able to announce a /64 IPv6 Prefix, which could be beneficial for the configuration.\n\n",

While traditional setups involve hardwired connections between APs for optimal performance, meshing provides flexibility in scenarios where running cables is impractical or too costly. Peplink supports both Wi-Fi meshing and roaming, allowing users to configure multiple APs to work together either through wired connections or wirelessly. The setup process for meshing can be done via the Peplink user interface or through InControl for zero-touch configuration. Users must create a wireless mesh network and assign it to a profile to ensure proper functionality. The technology also includes considerations for performance limitations, emphasizing that wired connections are preferable when possible.\n\n## Document_26\n\nThe log indicates that clients are experiencing authentication failures with the SSID 'Audhumbla', leading to temporary disconnections. The reason code 2 signifies that the previous authentication is no longer valid, which may point to client configuration issues or unsupported features by the clients. It is suggested to check if the configuration has worked reliably on older firmware versions, test clients against another access point with identical settings, and consider disabling WPA3 if enabled, as well as turning off features like PMF (802.11w) or other extensions such as 802.11k/r/v that may be causing connectivity issues.\n\n## Document_27\n\nTo regain access to a Soho mk3 router after losing the username and password, users can utilize the Remote Web Admin feature through the InControl2 central management platform. If InControl2 is not available, a factory reset is necessary, which will erase all current configurations on the router.\n\n## Document_28\n\nTo reset the username and password for a Soho mk3 router without losing the current configuration, access the device dashboard in InControl2 and navigate to the settings for remote web admin.\n\n## Document_29\n\nTo resolve authentication issues with the PEPWAVE_SOHO Wi-Fi network, ensure that the security policy is set to WPA/WPA2 - Personal in the security settings. Additionally, reset the wireless SSID pre-shared key and delete any related Wi-Fi profiles on the mobile device before re-associating with the Surf Soho Wi-Fi access point.\n\n## Document_30\n\nTo import settings from an old Peplink Balance 380 to a new one, it is essential to have a backup of the configuration file, which can be downloaded from the router's admin interface under System > Configuration > Download Active Configurations. If a backup is available, it can be imported into the new device. However, swapping the internal card between devices is not a viable option. Regularly backing up the configuration after changes is recommended for ease of recovery.\n\n## Document_31\n\nSwapping the card from an old Balance 380 to a new Balance 380 is a viable method to transfer settings, and it successfully powered on and functioned correctly. However, it is necessary to upgrade the firmware from version 5.4 to a newer version for optimal performance.\n\n## Document_32\n\nTo transfer settings from an old Peplink Balance 380 to a new one, it is possible to back up the configuration file from the old device and then import it into the new device.\n\n## Document_33\n\nAggregating multiple SIM cards in a Pepwave HD4 router can potentially increase overall bandwidth, but actual speeds may be limited by the bandwidth pool of the cellular tower being used. The performance can vary depending on the provider and the specific tower's capacity. While the theoretical expectation is to achieve higher speeds by using multiple SIMs, practical limitations may prevent reaching the desired aggregate speed due to network constraints.\n\n## Document_34\n\nTo aggregate the speed of multiple SIM cards using Pepwave MAX HD2 or HD4 models, it is important to choose suitable frequency-specific antennas and align narrow beam width directional antennas towards different towers. Splitting SIMs across multiple carriers is recommended, ensuring they are not part of a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO). Conducting detailed surveys of the area, including carrier back-haul and population density, is crucial. Additionally, utilizing the latest firmware features to select specific frequencies for each SIM can enhance performance.\n\n## Document_35\n\nThe Pepwave MAX series includes LTE-A models that can combine multiple frequency bands to enhance speed. To achieve bandwidth bonding with models like the Pepwave MAX-HD2 LTE-A or HD4 LTE-A, it is necessary to utilize both primary and secondary signal strengths from multiple SIM cards to aggregate their speeds effectively.\n\n## Document_36\n\nTo achieve an aggregated speed of 80 Mbps using four SIM cards in a router with four slots, it is necessary to utilize a device that supports such aggregation, like the Pepwave HD4. The Load-Balance feature can be used for distributing traffic across multiple connections, but it may require routing adjustments if users are behind a NAT, depending on the specific network configuration.\n\n## Document_37\n\nTo achieve speed aggregation from multiple SIM cards in a Pepwave device, it is feasible to aggregate 4 SIMs to potentially reach a combined speed of 80 Mbps. However, specific details on the implementation or configuration steps were not provided in the response.\n\n## Document_38\n\nTo mesh two PepLink Surf SOHO Mk3 routers wirelessly and broadcast the same network, the first Surf SOHO can create two SSIDs: \"Network1\" and \"AcrossTheStreet\". The second Surf SOHO should then use WiFi as WAN connected to the \"AcrossTheStreet\" network, allowing it to also broadcast \"Network1\". It is recommended to limit the \"AcrossTheStreet\" network to one frequency band, using 2.4GHz for better range over longer distances or 5GHz for faster speeds and reduced interference over shorter distances.\n\n",

    "query": "How should a technician troubleshoot persistent WiFi authentication failures on a Pepwave Surf Soho Mk3 network using WPA2-Personal, and what steps should be taken regarding firmware and client device settings?",
    "answer": "To troubleshoot persistent WiFi authentication failures on a Pepwave Surf Soho Mk3 network configured with WPA2-Personal, the technician should first ensure that the WiFi security setting is explicitly set to WPA/WPA2-Personal and that the correct pre-shared key is applied on both the router and client devices. If issues persist, reset the wireless SSID pre-shared key and delete any saved WiFi profiles on the affected client devices before reconnecting. The technician should also verify that the router is running the latest compatible firmware (at least version 6.2.0 or newer), as older firmware may have unresolved compatibility or stability issues. If authentication failures continue, check client device compatibility with WPA2 and consider disabling advanced features such as WPA3, PMF (802.11w), or 802.11k/r/v extensions on the AP, as these may cause connectivity problems. Testing with another access point configured identically can help isolate whether the issue is specific to the Soho Mk3 or the client devices.",

Users have reported achieving speeds of 75-80 Mbps on the 5 GHz band when in close proximity to the router. Factors affecting Wi-Fi performance include channel saturation from other networks, environmental noise, and router placement. It is recommended to separate IoT devices onto their own VLAN and SSID, and to enable only the 5 GHz band for main usage to improve overall performance. Quality of Service (QoS) settings may impact performance negatively, although this has not been tested by all users.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Surf SOHO has a WAN port and LAN ports that support 1000Mbps, but the overall router throughput is limited to 100-120Mbps due to a balance of hardware and software capabilities. While LAN port speeds allow for fast file transfers between connected devices, this does not affect the routing throughput, which is a separate function from switching capabilities.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe Surf SOHO has a WAN port and four LAN ports that support 1000Mbps, but the router's throughput is limited to 100-120Mbps. This limitation affects the total throughput of the device, meaning that while the hardware can handle higher speeds, the actual data transfer rate is capped by the router's processing capabilities, which may lead to underutilization of higher-speed internet connections.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Surf SOHO router supports Gigabit Ethernet on the LAN side, but it is limited to a maximum Internet connection speed of 100Mbps. This means that while the LAN ports can handle Gigabit speeds, the overall Internet throughput is capped at 100Mbps.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe current version of the Pepwave Surf SOHO has a maximum router throughput of 120 Mbps, which explains the lower speed test results observed when connected to a fiber optic connection. Users should not expect to achieve gigabit speeds with this device, as its specifications limit the throughput significantly below that level.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput of 120 Mbps, which is significantly lower than the gigabit speeds available from fiber optic connections. Users may experience lower speeds on different connection types, such as 190 Mbps on a gigabit Ethernet USB dongle and 45 Mbps on 5GHz WiFi, indicating that the router's limitations are affecting overall performance.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 has a specified throughput capability of 120 Mbps. Users may experience lower speeds when connected through the router compared to a direct connection to the modem, which can be attributed to the router's limitations.\n\n## Document_17\n\nWhen using a Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 with an ARRIS SB6141 Cable Modem, users may experience reduced throughput compared to direct modem connections. The Surf SOHO MK3 is confirmed to operate at 1000Base-T mode, but users have reported download speeds between 50-57 Mbps despite having a 160 Mbps service. Testing on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands may yield different performance results, as indicated by a user who experienced 44 Mbps on 2.4 GHz and 62 Mbps on 5 GHz with a similar setup.\n\n## Document_18\n\nWhen using a Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 with an ARRIS SB6141 Cable Modem, users may experience reduced throughput, achieving only 50-57 Mbps compared to direct connections to the modem that yield 160-170 Mbps. The Surf SOHO MK3 is running firmware version 7.1.0 and has been tested with various port speed settings, including 1000Mbps duplex and Auto, but these adjustments did not improve speeds. The router's advertised aggregate throughput is 120 Mbps, which may be a limiting factor in achieving higher speeds through the router.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 has a rated WAN throughput of 120Mbps, which can lead to reduced speeds based on network traffic and router load. For users requiring higher throughput, the Balance One with WiFi is recommended as a more suitable device for high-speed connections.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe throughput of the Pepwave SOHO MK 3 router is rated at 120Mbps, which means that regardless of the ISP plan providing 1Gbps, the maximum internet speed available to clients connected to the router will be limited to 120Mbps due to the router's specifications.\n\n## Document_21\n\nThe Surf SOHO router has a maximum throughput of 100 Mbps and is designed primarily for residential applications. It features one Ethernet WAN port, which limits its capability for failover to a second Ethernet WAN connection. For setups requiring support for more than 15 devices, such as 30 devices in this case, it may be advisable to consider the Balance 20 or higher for better performance and reliability.\n\n## Document_22\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput limit of 120 Mbps, which means it cannot achieve higher speeds regardless of the internet plan. For users needing higher speeds, upgrading to a more powerful unit such as the Balance One, which supports up to 600 Mbps, or the Balance 20X, which supports up to 900 Mbps, is recommended. These speeds are under optimal conditions, and actual speeds may vary based on factors like Wi-Fi signal strength and channel congestion.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe Surf SOHO MK3 is expected to provide better Wi-Fi performance than the reported speeds of 5-8 Mbps, which are not typical for this device. Users have experienced speeds of 32 Mbps on the 2.4GHz band with a standard 20MHz channel width. To improve Wi-Fi performance, it is suggested to switch channels, adjust channel width, and change Wi-Fi bands. Additionally, using a Wi-Fi analyzer can help identify network issues, and testing the router in different physical locations may yield better results.\n\n## Document_24\n\nTo address poor Wi-Fi performance on the Surf SOHO MK3, it is important to consider potential interference from other devices operating on the 2.4GHz band, such as baby monitors, microwaves, and cordless phones. Users can access a support page specific to the Surf SOHO that provides Ethernet details to help identify interference issues. Additionally, the router has a feature for Ethernet packet capture, which can assist in diagnosing network problems by pinpointing where issues may arise.\n\n## Document_25\n\nWi-Fi performance issues with the Surf SOHO MK3 may be related to devices using a random MAC address, particularly Android 10 devices, which can appear with a blank MAC address in the client list. This could affect the router's ability to manage connections effectively, potentially leading to lower Wi-Fi speeds.\n\n## Document_26\n\nThe Surf SOHO router has a WAN port and LAN ports that support speeds of 1000Mbps; however, its throughput is limited to 100-120Mbps. This means that while the physical ports can handle high-speed connections, the router's processing capacity restricts the actual data transmission rate to a maximum of 120Mbps, which aligns with the specifications provided in the Surf SOHO spec sheet.\n\n## Document_27\n\nThe Surf SOHO router supports Gigabit Ethernet speeds, but due to a user interface bug, the option for 1000Mbps is not displayed in the drop-down list; users should select the Auto option to utilize Gigabit speeds. This issue is acknowledged and will be addressed in a future update.\n\n## Document_28\n\nThe Surf SOHO router, specifically Hardware Revision 2, has a maximum throughput of 100Mbps for Internet bandwidth, which may lead to confusion regarding its Ethernet port speeds. While the router supports Gigabit Ethernet, the actual Internet bandwidth throughput is limited to 100Mbps.\n\n## Document_29\n\nThe throughput of a Pepwave Surf SOHO router can be influenced by several factors including the number of configured rules and the use of special features. Peplink tends to be conservative in their bandwidth specifications. WiFi performance can vary significantly due to factors such as frequency band, channel interference, signal strength, channel width, number of streams, and the WiFi generation of both the router and the client device.\n\n## Document_30\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 may not be able to handle the upgraded internet speed of 400 Mbps, as indicated by the user's experience of only achieving 110 Mbps when connected through the router. Other models, such as the Balance One Core and three additional models, support throughput ranging from 350 to 600 Mbps, which may be more suitable for higher speed internet connections.\n\n## Document_31\n\nWhen using a Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 with an ARRIS SB6141 Cable Modem, users may experience reduced download speeds compared to direct connections to the modem. The Surf SOHO MK3 is confirmed to operate at 1000Base-T mode, and settings such as port speed and upload/download bandwidth are set to 1 Gbps. Initial CPU usage during boot may affect speed test results, suggesting that waiting for the router to stabilize before testing could yield better performance.\n\n## Document_32\n\nThe recommended user capacity for the Peplink Balance 20/30 and Surf SOHO devices is about 25 users simultaneously, with a maximum throughput of 100Mbps. The Surf SOHO is a fail-over only device, allowing only one active connection at a time, while the Balance series supports multiple connections and load balancing. For scenarios involving growth and higher demand, it is advisable to consider the Balance 210/310 or Balance 305 models, which can accommodate future needs more effectively.\n\n",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nWhen a Pepwave BR1 Mini is stuck at obtaining IP, troubleshooting steps include changing cellular settings between the carrier and generic options, adjusting the APN settings, updating the PRL, performing a full cellular reset, and rebooting the device. If the SIM card works in another device, such as a hotspot, the issue may lie with the router or its connection to the cellular network rather than the SIM itself. Updating the cellular modem firmware may be necessary, but requires an internet connection, which is not available in this scenario.\n\n## Document_2\n\nTo determine the approximate speeds achievable with the Pepwave 310X 5G/4G modem, it is advised to consult a local Peplink Partner who may have experience deploying in the area. Testing performance with a rented router could also provide insights into expected speeds, as actual performance can vary significantly due to numerous factors.\n\n## Document_3\n\nWhen installing a SIM card, it is important to consider the size of the SIM card required for the device. A SIM adapter kit can be used to fit a nano SIM into a mini or standard SIM slot, which is useful if the SIM needs to be moved between devices with different slot sizes. This adapter is relatively inexpensive and allows for flexibility in using the SIM with various devices in the future.\n\n## Document_4\n\nAfter a hard reset of the Peplink router, access to the web interface is possible via the default IP address 192.168.50.1 with the credentials admin/admin. However, once the router establishes a data connection, the login credentials become invalid. This may indicate that the device is registered to another account, potentially requiring an InControl2 account for management. The device may also need additional licensing for certain features, including the addition of a second SIM card from another carrier.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe device in the photo is identified as the Pepwave HDX, which has not yet been publicly released and was previously seen only in development stages.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe device is compatible with both AT&T and Verizon networks, requiring only a SIM card and a data plan for operation.\n\n## Document_7\n\nTo find the latest firmware for the SIM Injector, users should refer to the specific support thread linked in the forum. To change the login username and password on the SIM Injector, users can navigate to the Settings menu and select Reset Settings, although the specifics of changing the credentials are not detailed in the response.\n\n## Document_8\n\nTo resolve connectivity issues with a Pepwave HD2 mini after swapping modems, it may be necessary to remove the internal battery for a couple of minutes before replacing it. This action can help restore functionality to both modems, allowing them to connect properly with a known good SIM card.\n\n## Document_9\n\nWhen using a Pepwave Max Transit with both SIMs enabled, a health check failure will trigger an active SIM swap, allowing the device to attempt a connection using the alternate SIM. If only one SIM is selected, the health check will not initiate a swap, as it relies on the active SIM only.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Pepwave HD4 MAX LTE modems up to CAT12 have a MAIN and AUX connection per modem, where the MAIN is used for both transmit and receive, while the AUX is for receive only. In contrast, Peplink routers with modems that are CAT18 and above feature four antenna connections per modem, typically with two connections designated for transmit/receive and the other two for receive only, effectively providing two MAIN and two AUX connections per modem.\n\n## Document_11\n\nCellular operators can track whether a SIM card has been used in different devices by monitoring the IMEI number, which is a unique identifier for each device. If a SIM card is moved to another device and then reinserted into a Pepwave Max Transit Cat 18, the operator may be able to detect this change, potentially leading to compatibility issues with the service provider.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe MAX BR-1 MK2 router is not recognizing the activated SIM card inserted in Slot A, as indicated by the WAN settings showing 'No SIM Card detected' and the cellular LED being off. The user has confirmed that the SIM card is activated and functional in a mobile phone, has the correct form factor (mini SIM), and has been inserted correctly with contacts facing down. The user has also attempted using Slot B and different SIM cards from various providers without success. There is a question regarding whether the cellular feature might be disabled on the device and how to enable it if so.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe SIM Injector PEPXIM is currently compatible with several devices, including the HD4 MBX, HD2 IP67 (HW4), HD2 Dome, SFE, and SFE Cam. More models are expected to support the SIM Injector in the future.\n\n## Document_14\n\nWhen using Sprint Data SIM cards with Pepwave devices, it is essential to register the SIM card to the specific IMEI number of the device for proper connectivity. Users have reported issues with obtaining an IP address despite the SIM card being recognized by the device. In some cases, other carriers' SIM cards have connected without issues, indicating potential compatibility problems with Sprint SIM cards. Factory resetting the router may be suggested by the carrier, but users are often hesitant due to the need to reconfigure settings.\n\n## Document_15\n\nPeplink devices, including the Pepwave HD4 Max, support the creation of IPsec tunnels with non-Peplink devices, such as Palo Alto firewalls, under standard conditions.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe MAX BR1 MK2 LTEA experiences sporadic failures where the LAN port does not respond to pings, and the device fails to ping its own IP address. This issue also affects the ability to ping external addresses, causing new connections through the Cellular interface to fail while existing connections remain active. The problem persists across different firmware versions and SIM providers, and the only resolution is to reboot the device. The health check settings for the Cellular interface can impact connectivity, with Ping mode causing failures while Smart Check maintains active connections.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe Pepwave Max BR1 Mini utilizes a Mini sized 2FF SIM card form factor.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Pepwave MAX Transit Duo supports simultaneous WAN links and outbound policy routing, while the non-Duo version does not. The next models that support outbound policy routing are the HD2 Mini and HD2 LTE, which are more expensive than the Transit Duo.\n\n## Document_19\n\nTo insert a SIM card into the Max BR1 LTE, it should be oriented with the gold contacts facing down and the notched side going in first. The SIM card will click into place when inserted correctly. To eject the SIM card, push it inward until it clicks out.\n\n## Document_20\n\nTo resolve the issue of a Pepwave HD2 LTE displaying 'No SIM Card Detected', ensure that the correct size SIM card is being used, specifically a full size 2FF SIM card. Additionally, verify that the SIM card is inserted correctly into the slot.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo resolve the issue of a Pepwave device not detecting a SIM card, it is important to ensure that the SIM card is the correct size. If the SIM card is a Micro SIM (3FF), an adapter may be needed to fit it into the device that requires a Mini SIM (2FF). Verifying the type of JetPack the SIM was pulled from can also assist in confirming compatibility.\n\n## Document_22\n\nAn AT&T SIM card may not function properly on the Pepwave MAX Transit 5G, as indicated by a user experiencing issues with their SIM on this device, while the same SIM works on a Pepwave HD1.\n\n## Document_23\n\nTo resolve issues with a MAX Transit Cat 18 modem that is stuck on obtaining an IP address despite having a strong signal, it is crucial to verify that the Access Point Name (APN) assigned by AT&T is exactly correct, as this can affect connectivity.\n\n## Document_24\n\nThe BR1 Mini is experiencing issues obtaining an IP address despite previous successful operation. The user has attempted various troubleshooting steps including changing cellular settings, updating the PRL, performing a full cellular reset, and rebooting the device. The carrier, Sprint, confirmed the SIM is in good standing and that there are no tower issues. The user is unable to update the cellular modem firmware due to lack of connection and does not have access to another wired network or SIM for updates. The SIM card is restricted from being moved to a third-party device, complicating further troubleshooting options.\n\n## Document_25\n\nTo bond multiple SIMs together in a Pepwave MAX-HD2 or MAX-HD4 for a single fast connection, a SpeedFusion Bonding license is required. However, the HD series devices come with the SpeedFusion Bonding license included. Product comparison pages provide information on which SpeedFusion features are supported natively and which require additional licensing or subscriptions.\n\n## Document_26\n\nWhen setting up a T-Mobile SIM card in a Pepwave BR1 Mini, if it is stuck on obtaining an IP address, it may be due to the SIM card being limited to certain IMEI numbers. To resolve this, it is recommended to first insert the SIM card into a phone, complete the activation process, ensure it receives a phone number, and use data for a few minutes before reinserting it into the Pepwave device.\n\n## Document_27\n\nThe performance of 4G and 5G speeds on the Pepwave 310X can be influenced by various factors including the time of day, geographical location, the level of 5G support in that area, the type of antennas used (indoor vs outdoor), and the specific configuration of the 310X device. In some locations, 5G may have limited support, resulting in speeds that do not surpass those of 4G. Testing with a 5G enabled phone in the intended usage area can provide a better estimate of expected speeds.\n\n## Document_28\n\nIf a Peplink device is purchased used and is locked out after connecting to the internet, it may be due to the device being registered in another user's InControl2 account. To regain access, the user should remove the SIM cards, perform a hard reset, log in with the default credentials, and disable InControl2 communication in the system settings. It is also advisable to contact the seller to have the device removed from their InControl2 organization for full functionality and management capabilities.\n\n## Document_29\n\nIf a Peplink device is locked to a previous IC2 subscription, the current owner must provide proof of ownership and possession to Peplink support to have the device removed from the previous account. This can be done by submitting a photo of the device's silver label and a diagnostic report from the device. Accessing the web interface may be affected by the device's previous configuration, and a hard reset can restore access to the default login credentials.\n\n## Document_30\n\nThe latest firmware for the SIM Injector can be found on the Peplink support downloads page. However, there is no information provided on how to change the login username/password for the SIM Injector, as the settings are not available in the web interface.\n\n## Document_31\n\nThe PepLink HD4 MAX features cellular modems with a configuration of one MAIN port and one AUX (diversity) antenna port for each of its four modems, as indicated on the product page. This configuration is standard in many 4G/LTE modems, allowing for improved signal reception and redundancy.\n\n## Document_32\n\nWhen using a Pepwave Max Transit Cat 18 with a Cricket SIM card, it is important to note that carriers track the IMEI of the device that registers on their network. If the SIM card is moved to another device and then back to the Pepwave, there is a risk that the Pepwave may be blocked from the network. However, if the SIM remains in the Pepwave, it should be grandfathered for a year. SIM cards generally stay in place well, but there is a slight chance they could be dislodged during relocation.\n\n## Document_33\n\nWhen using a Pepwave Max Transit Cat 18 with a Cricket SIM, it is generally safe to eject and reinsert the SIM card into the same device without affecting its compatibility, as long as the SIM is not placed into a different device with a different IMEI. The device should remain functional and not be flagged by Cricket if the SIM is only removed and reinserted in the same Pepwave device, even if it is powered off during the process.\n\n## Document_34\n\nWhen using a Pepwave Max Transit Cat 18 with a Cricket SIM, inserting and removing the SIM card from the same device is equivalent to powering the device off and back on. There is a concern that moving the SIM to another device and back could result in the Pepwave being blocked, but if the SIM is only removed and reinserted into the same Pepwave device, it should not trigger any incompatibility issues with Cricket's network.\n\n## Document_35\n\nWhen experiencing issues with Sprint Data SIM cards not connecting to the network on a Pepwave device, it is crucial to ensure that the correct type of SIM is being used. LTE devices require SIMGLW106R SIMs, while LTEA devices require SIMGLW106Q SIMs. Using an incompatible SIM could be the reason for the failure to obtain an IP address.\n\n## Document_36\n\nThe issue with the Sprint Data SIM cards not connecting to the network and displaying 'Obtaining IP Address' may be due to a bad batch of SIM cards, as indicated by the SIM provider. They confirmed that while the SIMs were labeled correctly, the internal chip was not functioning as expected, leading to connectivity problems.\n\n## Document_37\n\nWhen experiencing issues with a Pepwave BR1 router not detecting a SIM card, it is important to ensure that the SIM card size is compatible, as the BR1 requires a standard SIM while some Jetpack models may use a micro SIM. Checking the physical installation of the SIM card is also crucial to ensure it is properly seated in the slot.\n\n## Document_38\n\nWhen using AT&T SIMs on the Pepwave MAX Transit 5G, it may be necessary to manually set the APN to establish a connection, but even after doing so, traffic may not pass. In contrast, the device works fine with Verizon and T-Mobile networks.\n\n",

    "query": "When troubleshooting a Pepwave device that is stuck at 'Obtaining IP Address' with a cellular SIM, what multi-step process—covering SIM compatibility, carrier restrictions, and device settings—should a technician follow to isolate the issue?",
    "answer": "A technician should first confirm that the SIM card is the correct size and type for the device, as Pepwave models require specific SIM form factors and LTE/LTEA variants may require different SIM types. If the SIM card is recognized but still stuck at 'Obtaining IP Address,' the technician should check for carrier-specific restrictions, such as whether the SIM is locked to certain IMEI numbers or registered to the device (as is the case with some Sprint and T-Mobile SIMs). The APN settings should be verified for accuracy, as incorrect APNs can prevent IP assignment. The technician should also try the SIM in another device, if permitted, to rule out a SIM fault—but note that moving the SIM to a device with a different IMEI may cause the carrier to block it from the Pepwave in the future. If the SIM works elsewhere, the issue likely lies with the Pepwave device, requiring checks of cellular settings (carrier/generic mode), PRL updates, resets, and possibly a firmware update—although the latter requires an alternate internet connection. Throughout, the technician should be cautious about carrier practices that track SIM use by IMEI, as this can cause compatibility issues if the SIM is swapped between devices.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nTo activate a Verizon SIM card for a Peplink Max Transit Pro E router, it is recommended to initially activate the SIM using a generic IMEI from a different device, such as a Nighthawk, before inserting it into the Peplink router. This workaround is necessary due to issues with the IMEI match tool used by Verizon, which may be overly restrictive or malfunctioning.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe MAX-BR1-LTE-US is designed to support LTE connections, but users have reported issues connecting to 4G LTE networks after moving SIM cards between devices. In some cases, the router defaults to 2G or 3G connections despite the SIM card being capable of 4G. Users have noted that setting the SIM slot option to 'LTE Only' does not prompt the device to search for 4G networks. Additionally, firmware updates have not resolved the connectivity issues, leading to speculation about potential warranty-related restrictions affecting the device's functionality, such as disabling remote management and GPS tracking.\n\n## Document_3\n\nTo activate a Pepwave BR1 Pro 5G on Verizon's network, users have reported success by utilizing the IMEI of a 5G Verizon jetpack to submit the order and activate the device, even if the IMEI initially caused issues with plan creation. Once activated, the new SIM card worked immediately in the Pepwave device, which was identified as a Pepwave Max BR1 on Verizon's portal.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe MAX-BR1-MINI-LTEA-W-T-PRM has both Industry Canada (IC) and FCC certifications as indicated on its label. However, the certification status for the MAX-BR1-MINI-LTE-US-T-PRM is not confirmed as it is not currently in stock.\n\n## Document_5\n\nTo resolve the issue of a Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini not obtaining an IP address when using a Verizon SIM card from an old iPhone, it is important to ensure that the device is certified for use on the Verizon network. Generally, a voice-capable SIM from Verizon will not work in a data-only device like the Pepwave. Obtaining a data-only plan with a new SIM and number is recommended for proper activation. Users have reported that a previously activated Verizon data-only SIM may work in non-certified devices, but success can vary. For unresolved issues, contacting Verizon's second-level support is advisable for better assistance.\n\n## Document_6\n\nTo get a Pepwave Max-BR1-LTE-V-T operational on Verizon's network, an activated SIM card from Verizon is required. Users have noted that Verizon customer support may not be well-versed in these devices, which can lead to confusion. Additionally, the IMEI number of the device can be found in the configuration settings rather than on the physical label, which may be useful when contacting support for assistance.\n\n## Document_7\n\nWhen activating a Pepwave MAX-BR1-Mini-LTEA-W-T with a Verizon BYOD SIM, users may encounter issues with the IMEI recognition. The Verizon system may not recognize the device, even when the correct 15-character IMEI is used. A workaround involves activating a Verizon Jetpack first, then transferring the SIM to the Pepwave MAX, although the account page may still not recognize the MAX device.\n\n## Document_8\n\nTo activate a Verizon BYOD SIM in a Pepwave MAX-BR1-Mini-LTEA-W-T, it is important to note that Verizon and other carriers can be selective about which data plans are compatible with commercial routers. If activation fails using the 15 character IMEI, it may be necessary to try using a 14 character IMEI, which is the 15 character IMEI without the last digit. If issues persist, activating the SIM with a different IMEI before transferring it to the BR1 may be required.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe MAX-BR1-MINI-LTEA-W-T and MAX-BR1-MINI-LTE-US-T models are both certified on Verizon. Issues with obtaining an IP address on the LTEA-W-T may be related to authentication problems, as the SIM card works in the older LTE-US-T model but only connects as 3G. The custom Verizon APN for static IPs has been entered, but the SIM still fails to connect in the LTEA-W-T model.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo activate SIM cards for the Pepwave MAX-HD2-LTE-US-T router with Verizon, it is necessary to provide the IMEI numbers of the device to Verizon. If there are issues with activation, it is recommended to verify with Peplink that the IMEI numbers have been correctly uploaded into Verizon's database, as they can sometimes be overlooked.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Pepwave Max-Br1-Mini-LTE-US-T is experiencing compatibility issues with the Verizon network, as it is not GPS compatible, which is required for activation. Users in North America need the model MAX-BR1-LTE-V-T for compatibility with Verizon. The MAX-BR1-Mini-LTE-A is available but is not certified for use on Verizon. A pre-activated SIM card from Verizon may be necessary for successful activation.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo activate a Pepwave MAX-BR1-Mini-LTE-US-T on the Verizon network, it is essential to register the IMEI number with Verizon. Issues may arise if there are existing devices on the account that conflict with the activation process, such as a 3G air card. Once the device is registered and any billing conflicts are resolved, the Pepwave can come online and function correctly. The Pepwave MAX-BR1 is noted for its advanced features and ease of configuration, particularly for applications like security systems and messaging.\n\n## Document_13\n\nFor a stable internet connection in South Korea for P2P live videostreaming, it is recommended to use a Pepwave MAX-HD2-Mini-LTE-E-T, MAX-HD2-LTE-E-T, or MAX-HD4-LTE-E-T, as the MAX-On-The-Go and MAX-BR1-LTE-E-T do not support bandwidth bonding. Utilizing Peplink's SpeedFusion VPN with the existing Balance 310 can significantly improve the chances of achieving the required stable speed of 12 MBits for several hours of transmission.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo use a Pepwave MAX BR1 with Verizon, the correct model is MAX-BR1-LTE-V-T, and it requires a pre-activated SIM card. The IMEI of the MAX-BR1-LTE-US-T cannot be activated on Verizon's network.\n\n## Document_15\n\nTo troubleshoot a Pepwave Max BR1 not recognizing a Verizon SIM card, ensure the SIM is properly inserted and active on the Verizon network. If the SIM card is not provisioned, it is necessary to contact Verizon and provide the IMEI of the BR1 for activation.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo resolve issues with activating a SIM card for a Peplink MAX-BR1-MINI-LTEA-US-T-PRM on Verizon, users have found success by first activating the SIM in a Verizon device and then transferring it to the Peplink router. This workaround suggests that there may be internal restrictions or policies at Verizon affecting direct activation on Peplink devices.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo activate a Verizon prepaid plan for use with a Pepwave Max BR1 LTE-A, one effective strategy is to first activate the SIM card using a Verizon jetpack, which can be purchased used or refurbished. After activation, the SIM can then be transferred to the BR1. This method not only facilitates the activation process but also provides a backup device for troubleshooting, as there may be instances where SMS verification is required for account access.\n\n## Document_18\n\nTo activate a MAX-BR1-MINI-LTE-US-T on Verizon, it is noted that Verizon may have difficulties with activating commercial devices for residential customers, particularly on prepaid plans. If the device shows as not compatible when attempting to add it to an existing account, calling Verizon support can help validate the device and obtain a SIM for activation. A method to successfully enter the IMEI involves using a fresh browser with cleared cookies, navigating to Verizon's website, selecting single device plans under the Bring Your Own option, and entering the IMEI. The device is confirmed to work on a prepaid plan if activated with a SIM from a supported Jetpack first.\n\n## Document_19\n\nWhen considering the Max BR1 Mini with an LTEA (Cat 6) radio for Verizon service, it is important to note that activation issues may arise depending on the plan type. A user experienced difficulties activating the device on a prepaid plan, while it was confirmed to be compatible with postpaid plans. There may be a separate database for prepaid services that Peplink needs to update. An alternative suggestion for activation includes ordering a Jetpack device and swapping the SIM after activation.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThere are issues reported with activating Verizon Prepay service on commercial routers like the BR1 Mini. Users have experienced difficulties adding data when the plan runs out, and there are indications that Verizon may not activate Prepay service with such routers. The Verizon 700 MHz band is noted as a potential solution for connectivity issues, although the overall business aspect of the service appears to be problematic.\n\n## Document_21\n\nThe Pepwave Max Transit LTEA with the CAT-18 modem is currently undergoing Verizon certification, which is causing compatibility issues for activation on their network. It is suggested that users can temporarily use an active SIM card from a different device to bypass this issue. Additionally, IMEI checkers on carrier websites are noted to be unreliable, particularly for devices other than smartphones.\n\n## Document_22\n\nTo bond multiple SIMs together in a Pepwave MAX-HD2 or MAX-HD4 for a single fast connection, a SpeedFusion Bonding license is required. However, the HD series devices come with the SpeedFusion Bonding license included. Product comparison pages provide information on which SpeedFusion features are supported natively and which require additional licensing or subscriptions.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe AT&T Annual prepaid plan referred to as the \"Tablet Plan\" may not be suitable for use with the Pepwave BR1 Mini, particularly if it is causing issues with obtaining an IP address. The APN setting is automatically set to \"broadband,\" which is typical for such plans, but if the cellular status remains stuck at \"Obtaining an IP,\" there may be compatibility issues or misconfigurations. Users should consider alternative carriers for better coverage and compatibility with mobile routers like the BR1 Mini.\n\n## Document_24\n\nThe Peplink Max Transit Pro E router is compatible with Verizon services, as indicated by both Verizon's website and their phone support. However, there seems to be confusion regarding its performance, with a Verizon tech incorrectly stating that the device operates at a level comparable to 3G, which is no longer supported on new plans. The user is currently utilizing LTE-A on T-Mobile, suggesting that the router is capable of supporting LTE-A connections.\n\n## Document_25\n\nThe Peplink Max Transit Pro E router is not a 3G-only device, as Peplink has not manufactured such products for a long time. Issues with obtaining a Verizon SIM card may stem from the cellular company's policies rather than the capabilities of the Peplink router itself, which is designed to support LTE-A and should not be classified as 'barely better than 3G.'\n\n## Document_26\n\nThe IMSI number refers to the SIM card information rather than the cellular modem type. To determine if the device is capable of LTE, it is important to confirm with the service provider whether the SIM card being used is an LTE SIM card, as some IoT SIMs may only support 3G connections.\n\n## Document_27\n\nThe connection issue with the MAX-BR1-LTE-US only allowing 3G on Verizon may be due to the type of SIM card being used. Some operators lock their SIM cards to work only with smartphones or tablets, which can result in speed capping or limited connectivity when used in a router. It is recommended to use a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) SIM or a SIM with a data plan that permits use in a router for better performance.\n\n## Document_28\n\nThe MAX-BR1-LTE-US is designed for LTE connectivity, but if it is only connecting to 3G on Verizon, it may indicate that the modem is not functioning as intended or that there are compatibility issues with the SIM card or network settings. The mention of an IMSI number suggests that the device is recognized as a 3G modem, which raises questions about whether the device is indeed an LTE model or if it is a different version, such as the mk2 model.\n\n## Document_29\n\nTo resolve the issue of a Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini not obtaining an IP address when using a Verizon SIM card that was previously activated on an iPhone, it is important to ensure that the SIM card is associated with a proper data plan that is compatible with the router. Not all SIM cards that work in smartphones will function correctly in a router, as they may require specific configurations or plans for data usage.\n\n## Document_30\n\nWhen using a SIM card from an old iPhone activated on Verizon in a Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini, issues may arise if there is a mismatch between the hardware and the data plan. Some phone plans may not be compatible with routers, which can lead to problems such as the device being stuck on 'Obtaining IP Address.'\n\n## Document_31\n\nWhen using a SIM card from an old iPhone activated on Verizon in a Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini, if the device is stuck on 'Obtaining IP Address', it may indicate an issue with the SIM card compatibility or the data plan settings. It is common for cell carriers' customer support to lack knowledge about setting up accounts for such devices, leading users to attempt using phone SIM cards directly. Proper configuration and compatibility with the carrier's data plan are essential for successful operation.\n\n## Document_32\n\nTo get the Max-BR1-LTE-V-T operational on Verizon's network, it is necessary to acquire an activated SIM card from Verizon. The activation process requires providing Verizon with the IMEI number of the device, which can be found on the label of the router.\n\n## Document_33\n\nTo get the Max-BR1-LTE-V-T operational on Verizon's network, an activated SIM card is required, and Verizon will need the IMEI number for LTE units or the MEID number for 3G units during the activation process. It is important to ensure that the correct SIM card size is used, specifically a mini-SIM card for this device.\n\n## Document_34\n\nTo get the Max-BR1-LTE-V-T operational on Verizon's network, an activated SIM card is required. It is important to ensure that the SIM card is the correct size, as specified on the updated product specification pages provided by Peplink.\n\n## Document_35\n\nTo get the Max-BR1-LTE-V-T operational on Verizon's network, it is necessary to obtain an activated SIM card from Verizon, which may require contacting their sales department for assistance. The device is intended for use with a prepaid data plan, and users have reported difficulties in activating the SIM card due to Verizon's lack of familiarity with the device. It is important to have the IMEI, SIM card number, location number, order number, and assigned phone number available when seeking support from Verizon.\n\n",

    "query": "What are the most effective methods for activating a Verizon SIM card for use in various Pepwave MAX BR1 and BR1 Mini models, considering common issues with IMEI recognition, plan compatibility, and device certification?",
    "answer": "The most effective methods for activating a Verizon SIM card in Pepwave MAX BR1 and BR1 Mini models involve several key strategies to overcome issues with IMEI recognition, plan compatibility, and device certification. First, if direct activation fails due to IMEI mismatch or lack of recognition (a common problem with Verizon's BYOD portal), users should activate the SIM card using the IMEI of a Verizon-certified device, such as a Jetpack or Nighthawk hotspot. Once activated, the SIM can be transferred to the Pepwave device, which often allows it to function even if the device is not directly recognized by Verizon. This workaround is especially helpful for residential or prepaid plans, where commercial router IMEIs are frequently rejected. Additionally, it is crucial to ensure the device model is certified for use on Verizon—models like the MAX-BR1-LTE-V-T are certified, while others like the MAX-BR1-LTE-US-T are not. Using a data-only SIM and plan is recommended, as voice-enabled SIMs or phone plans may not work reliably in routers. For persistent issues, contacting Verizon support and providing the device's IMEI (found in the router settings or label) can sometimes resolve activation or account conflicts. Finally, plan compatibility should be verified, as some Pepwave models and certain prepaid plans may not be supported due to carrier policy or certification status.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nVPC (Virtual Port Channel) is a layer 2 technology that allows devices to connect to two Nexus switches simultaneously without creating loops, utilizing a PE link for traffic management. VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) is an overlay technology that encapsulates layer 2 frames into IP packets for transport over a layer 3 underlay network, typically arranged in a spine-leaf topology for scalability. When integrating VPC with VXLAN, it is crucial to maintain a PE link between Nexus pairs and configure loopback interfaces correctly, including a secondary IP that must be identical on both switches. Best practices include using different loopback interfaces for BGP peering and NVE interfaces, implementing a delay restore command for VPC recovery, and ensuring spanning tree is enabled with a 4-second hello time. Additionally, a backup routing SVI can be created to maintain connectivity in case of uplink failures, and specific commands may be required for certain switch models to ensure proper VXLAN functionality.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe video discusses configuring VXLAN with EVPN in a network topology involving two switches and multiple tenants. It begins with setting up the underlay network, including configuring OSPF and MTU sizes, and then moves on to the overlay configuration, enabling BGP for peering and setting up an anycast gateway. The configuration includes creating Layer 3 VNIs, associating them with VLANs, and setting up route distinguishers and targets for BGP. The use of head-end replication for multicast traffic is highlighted, along with ARP suppression to improve efficiency. The process of adding tenants and verifying configurations through various commands is also covered, demonstrating the separation of tenant traffic and the functionality of the network setup.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe video discusses the configuration of EVPN (Ethernet Virtual Private Network) for multiple tenants using VNI (Virtual Network Identifier) in a network environment. It details the creation of a new tenant with specific configurations, including the use of VLANs and enabling IP forwarding. The anti-cast gateway is set as the default gateway for external networks, and the process of verifying the configuration is outlined using various commands such as 'show BGP l2vpn evpn summary' to check BGP neighbors and 'show NVE vni' to view VNIs associated with the VTEP (Virtual Tunnel Endpoint). The commands for troubleshooting and verifying connectivity, including ARP suppression and MAC address learning through BGP, are also highlighted. The separation of tenant traffic is confirmed through ping tests, demonstrating successful isolation of resources between tenants.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe video discusses the configuration of VxLAN using data plane learning on Nexus 9000 series switches. It begins with a basic topology involving two switches, each with a VTEP interface and a routed link simulating the underlay network. The configuration includes associating VLAN 1000 with VNI 5000, enabling OSPF for the underlay, and configuring multicast for BUM traffic. Key steps include setting the MTU to accommodate VxLAN headers, configuring access ports, and establishing loopback interfaces for the VTEP IP address and rendezvous point. The NVE interface is configured to encapsulate traffic, and verification commands are provided to check the status of the VTEP and VNI configurations. The video emphasizes the simplicity of data plane learning compared to control plane learning, which will be covered in a subsequent part.\n\n## Document_5\n\nVXLAN is an overlay technology that creates tunnels over an IP underlay network, utilizing ingress and egress VTEPs for traffic encapsulation and delivery. Address learning can be achieved through data plane learning, which is similar to traditional Ethernet, or control plane learning using BGP to share MAC address information. Unicast and BUM (Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, and Multicast) traffic types require different handling methods, with multicast being the preferred solution for scalability. Control plane learning allows switches to learn MAC addresses before they are needed, enhancing efficiency and providing VTEP authentication through BGP. Integrated routing and bridging are supported with BGP EVPN, allowing for both Layer 2 and Layer 3 VNIs, facilitating features like anycast gateway for virtual machine mobility. The configuration of these technologies will be explored in subsequent parts of the series.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe video discusses the spine-leaf topology, a network architecture often associated with VXLAN, which consists of two layers: the spine layer and the leaf layer. In this architecture, leaf switches connect to spine switches, with no direct connections between spine switches or leaf switches, ensuring a consistent topology and avoiding unnecessary paths. Each leaf switch has a link to every spine switch, and all links are routed, requiring IP addresses at each end. This design allows for equal path lengths and quick recovery from link or switch failures using Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing. The spine-leaf architecture is particularly suited for data centers, facilitating east-west traffic patterns and scalability by simply adding more leaf switches or links. VXLAN operates as an overlay on this architecture, enabling device mobility without IP address changes. Border leaf switches provide connectivity to external networks, integrating firewalls and routers, and managing route redistribution between the overlay and core routing protocols.\n\n## Document_7\n\nVXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) encapsulation is a technology that creates virtual Layer 2 segments called VNIs (VXLAN Network Identifiers) on top of a Layer 3 network. The process involves encapsulating an ordinary Ethernet frame, which may include a VLAN tag, into a VXLAN header that is added by a switch. The VXLAN header contains a 24-bit VNI, which allows for a large address space to support many VNIs. The encapsulated frame also includes UDP for transport, with a destination port of 4789 and a random source port for load balancing. An IP header and an Ethernet header are added for delivery, and upon reaching the destination, the headers are removed to deliver the original frame. The VXLAN header has reserved fields, with only one flag currently in use, and the additional headers can add around 50 bytes of overhead, necessitating the use of jumbo frames to avoid fragmentation and performance degradation.\n\n## Document_8\n\nVXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) is an overlay technology that simplifies network design by allowing virtual machines to communicate across different VLANs without changing IP addresses. It uses a 24-bit segment identifier called a VNI (Virtual Network Identifier), allowing for approximately 16 million unique segments, which is significantly more than the 4,000 VLANs supported by traditional VLAN IDs. VXLAN operates over an underlay network that is entirely Layer 3, eliminating the need for spanning tree protocols and trunking. Traffic is encapsulated in UDP and IP headers for transmission, and VXLAN can be implemented on both hardware and software, including hypervisors like ESX or Hyper-V. Each VXLAN-enabled switch or router has a special interface called a VTEP (VXLAN Tunnel Endpoint), which facilitates the connection between the overlay and underlay networks. This separation allows for changes in the underlay without redesigning the overlay, enhancing network flexibility and performance.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe video discusses the challenges and solutions related to configuring Virtual Port Channel (VPC) on Cisco Nexus switches, particularly in the context of routing protocols like OSPF. It highlights a scenario where routers and firewalls were not peering correctly with Nexus switches due to issues with TTL decrementing, which caused OSPF adjacencies to fail. The video explains that VPC is an enhanced link aggregation where traffic can be sent to either switch, but this can lead to packet drops if the TTL reaches zero. Solutions include ensuring routers are connected to switches with VPC, using orphan ports for peering, or changing links to routed ports. A key solution presented is the use of the 'layer three periodic' command in the VPC configuration, which stabilizes OSPF relationships, but requires the correct NX-OS version and hardware support.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe video outlines the configuration of a basic vPC (Virtual Port Channel) topology using two Nexus 9000 switches. The configuration process involves four main steps: enabling vPC and LACP features, configuring the keepalive link using management interfaces, setting up the vPC domain, and establishing the peer-link with two 40G ports in a port channel. The management ports are routed and can connect to a management network, while the keepalive link uses the management VRF. Switch 1 is designated as the primary switch with a priority of 10, and Switch 2 is set as the secondary with a higher priority. The peer-link configuration must be applied directly to the port channel, and member ports are associated with a vPC number. The video also explains orphan ports, which are normal ports without vPC configuration, and demonstrates how to identify them using the show vpc orphan ports command.\n\n",

      "VPC (Virtual Port Channel) is a layer 2 technology that allows devices to connect to two Nexus switches simultaneously without creating loops, utilizing a PE link for traffic management. VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) is an overlay technology that encapsulates layer 2 frames into IP packets for transport over a layer 3 underlay network, typically arranged in a spine-leaf topology for scalability. When integrating VPC with VXLAN, it is crucial to maintain a PE link between Nexus pairs and configure loopback interfaces correctly, including a secondary IP that must be identical on both switches. Best practices include using different loopback interfaces for BGP peering and NVE interfaces, implementing a delay restore command for VPC recovery, and ensuring spanning tree is enabled with a 4-second hello time. Additionally, a backup routing SVI can be created to maintain connectivity in case of uplink failures, and specific commands may be required for certain switch models to ensure proper VXLAN functionality.",
      "The video discusses configuring VXLAN with EVPN in a network topology involving two switches and multiple tenants. It begins with setting up the underlay network, including configuring OSPF and MTU sizes, and then moves on to the overlay configuration, enabling BGP for peering and setting up an anycast gateway. The configuration includes creating Layer 3 VNIs, associating them with VLANs, and setting up route distinguishers and targets for BGP. The use of head-end replication for multicast traffic is highlighted, along with ARP suppression to improve efficiency. The process of adding tenants and verifying configurations through various commands is also covered, demonstrating the separation of tenant traffic and the functionality of the network setup.",
      "The video discusses the configuration of EVPN (Ethernet Virtual Private Network) for multiple tenants using VNI (Virtual Network Identifier) in a network environment. It details the creation of a new tenant with specific configurations, including the use of VLANs and enabling IP forwarding. The anti-cast gateway is set as the default gateway for external networks, and the process of verifying the configuration is outlined using various commands such as 'show BGP l2vpn evpn summary' to check BGP neighbors and 'show NVE vni' to view VNIs associated with the VTEP (Virtual Tunnel Endpoint). The commands for troubleshooting and verifying connectivity, including ARP suppression and MAC address learning through BGP, are also highlighted. The separation of tenant traffic is confirmed through ping tests, demonstrating successful isolation of resources between tenants.",
      "The video discusses the configuration of VxLAN using data plane learning on Nexus 9000 series switches. It begins with a basic topology involving two switches, each with a VTEP interface and a routed link simulating the underlay network. The configuration includes associating VLAN 1000 with VNI 5000, enabling OSPF for the underlay, and configuring multicast for BUM traffic. Key steps include setting the MTU to accommodate VxLAN headers, configuring access ports, and establishing loopback interfaces for the VTEP IP address and rendezvous point. The NVE interface is configured to encapsulate traffic, and verification commands are provided to check the status of the VTEP and VNI configurations. The video emphasizes the simplicity of data plane learning compared to control plane learning, which will be covered in a subsequent part.",
      "VXLAN is an overlay technology that creates tunnels over an IP underlay network, utilizing ingress and egress VTEPs for traffic encapsulation and delivery. Address learning can be achieved through data plane learning, which is similar to traditional Ethernet, or control plane learning using BGP to share MAC address information. Unicast and BUM (Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, and Multicast) traffic types require different handling methods, with multicast being the preferred solution for scalability. Control plane learning allows switches to learn MAC addresses before they are needed, enhancing efficiency and providing VTEP authentication through BGP. Integrated routing and bridging are supported with BGP EVPN, allowing for both Layer 2 and Layer 3 VNIs, facilitating features like anycast gateway for virtual machine mobility. The configuration of these technologies will be explored in subsequent parts of the series.",
      "The video discusses the spine-leaf topology, a network architecture often associated with VXLAN, which consists of two layers: the spine layer and the leaf layer. In this architecture, leaf switches connect to spine switches, with no direct connections between spine switches or leaf switches, ensuring a consistent topology and avoiding unnecessary paths. Each leaf switch has a link to every spine switch, and all links are routed, requiring IP addresses at each end. This design allows for equal path lengths and quick recovery from link or switch failures using Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing. The spine-leaf architecture is particularly suited for data centers, facilitating east-west traffic patterns and scalability by simply adding more leaf switches or links. VXLAN operates as an overlay on this architecture, enabling device mobility without IP address changes. Border leaf switches provide connectivity to external networks, integrating firewalls and routers, and managing route redistribution between the overlay and core routing protocols.",
      "VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) encapsulation is a technology that creates virtual Layer 2 segments called VNIs (VXLAN Network Identifiers) on top of a Layer 3 network. The process involves encapsulating an ordinary Ethernet frame, which may include a VLAN tag, into a VXLAN header that is added by a switch. The VXLAN header contains a 24-bit VNI, which allows for a large address space to support many VNIs.

    "query": "When integrating VPC and VXLAN technologies on Cisco Nexus switches in a spine-leaf topology, what are the key configuration and operational considerations to ensure proper functionality, scalability, and resiliency, especially regarding loopback interface usage, spanning tree, BGP/EVPN, and traffic encapsulation?",
    "answer": "Successfully integrating VPC and VXLAN on Cisco Nexus switches in a spine-leaf topology requires careful attention to several configuration and operational details:\n\n1. Maintain a PE (peer) link between Nexus VPC pairs to prevent loops and ensure proper traffic management. Configure the peer-link as a port channel and use the keepalive link for VPC health, as outlined in VPC best practices.\n2. Use different loopback interfaces for BGP peering and NVE (Network Virtualization Edge) interfaces. The NVE loopback should have a secondary IP that is identical on both switches in the VPC pair for VXLAN overlay functionality.\n3. Enable and properly configure spanning tree with a 4-second hello time to ensure loop avoidance and fast convergence in the VPC domain.\n4. Implement BGP EVPN for control-plane MAC address learning and separation of tenant traffic. Configure Layer 3 VNIs for routing between segments, associate VLANs with VNIs, and set up route distinguishers and targets for BGP.\n5. Ensure the MTU is increased (jumbo frames) to accommodate VXLAN encapsulation overhead (~50 bytes) and prevent fragmentation.\n6. Deploy the spine-leaf topology, where each leaf connects to every spine, to achieve scalability and ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path) resiliency. VXLAN overlays this underlay for device mobility and tenant isolation.\n7. Optionally, configure a backup routing SVI to maintain connectivity during uplink failures.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the network will support scalable, resilient multi-tenant overlays with seamless integration between VPC and VXLAN technologies.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_4\n\nThe Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini LTEA operates on 802.11n with 1 spatial stream on the 2.4GHz band. Due to the inherent overhead protocols in the WiFi standard, real-world speeds are typically around 40-45% of the maximum PHY data rates achievable, which may explain the lower average speed reported during the PepVPN Test Configuration compared to the expected bandwidth limit of 200 Mbps down and up.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe internet connection issues with the Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini LTE may be attributed to poor cellular signal quality, as indicated by low SINR (3.6 dB) and RSRQ values. To improve connectivity and speeds, it is recommended to reposition the antennas and ensure that both the cellular and diversity antennas are properly installed.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe speed difference observed between a Pepwave BR1 mini and a mobile phone using the same SIM card may be due to the BR1 mini connecting on a 3G network instead of 4G LTE. Speeds of 2-3 Mbps are typical for 3G connections, while the mobile phone is achieving 8-9 Mbps, likely due to its ability to connect to a 4G LTE network.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe difference in speed between a Pepwave BR1 mini and a mobile phone using the same SIM card can be attributed to the Ec/Io value of -13.0 dB, indicating a high level of noise compared to the signal, which results in a poor quality connection to the tower. To improve the connection, it is suggested to use a directional antenna or a device with less gain, and to identify and eliminate any local sources of RF noise that may be affecting the signal quality.\n\n## Document_8\n\nWhen using a Pepwave MAX BR1 MK2 connected to a home WiFi network, users may experience slower download speeds compared to direct connections to the home WiFi. This can occur if the BR1 is used for both WiFi WAN and LAN connections, leading to reduced performance. To improve speeds, it is recommended to use a separate access point (AP) for LAN connections while allowing the BR1 to handle only the WiFi WAN. Additionally, the BR1 MK2 is older hardware, which may contribute to its lower performance compared to newer devices.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe Pepwave Max BR1 Mini is criticized for being underpowered for typical consumer use, particularly in RV settings. It features a CAT4 cellular modem, which is considered slow compared to newer standards, and operates on a single-band WiFi chipset limited to the 2.4GHz band without MIMO capabilities. This design leads to performance issues when using WiFi-WAN in conjunction with access point functions, as it requires alternating packet flows, which reduces overall performance. For better performance and reliability, alternatives such as the Max BR1 Pro 5G or Max Transit CAT18 are recommended, and using a separate device for WiFi access points is suggested for improved connectivity.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo address slow WiFi speeds on a Peplink BR1 mini while Ethernet speeds are fast, it is recommended to manually download and update the firmware to version 8.0.2. The customer should also contact the third-party vendor to adjust the sales registration date for a full 12-month InControl2 subscription, which facilitates remote diagnostics. Potential causes for slow WiFi could include loose WiFi antennas, interference from nearby equipment, or the need to change the WiFi channel and region settings. Checking the antenna connection and relocating the device may help improve speeds.\n\n## Document_11\n\nTo address slow WiFi speeds of 3.3Mbps on a Pepwave BR1 Mini, it is suggested to consider changing the wireless channel, adjusting transmit power (both increasing and decreasing), and exploring alternative antennas or their placement. Additionally, the drop in LTE speeds from 17Mbps to 2Mbps should be investigated further to determine if it is related to specific conditions or equipment changes.\n\n## Document_12\n\nIn testing the Pepwave BR1 Max LTE router, significant speed issues were observed compared to other devices. The AT&T Nighthawk provided 27ms latency with 37mbps down and 24mbps up, while the Verizon Home MiFi delivered 30ms latency with 44mbps down and 40mbps up. In contrast, the Pepwave showed 55ms latency with only 3.5mbps down and 1.2mbps up on AT&T, and 40ms latency with 4.5mbps down and 3mbps up on Verizon. The campground WiFi was also tested, yielding 90ms latency with 5.23mbps down and 0.39mbps up. Signal strength metrics were similar across devices, with RSSI and RSRP values indicating acceptable signal levels for both AT&T and Verizon bands.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Pepwave BR1 Max LTE router, when tested against other devices like the AT&T Nighthawk and Verizon Home MiFi, showed significantly lower speeds despite similar signal strength readings. For AT&T, the Pepwave recorded 55ms latency with 3.5mbps down and 1.2mbps up, while the Nighthawk achieved 27ms with 37mbps down and 24mbps up. For Verizon, the Pepwave had 40ms latency with 4.5mbps down and 3mbps up, compared to the MiFi's 30ms with 44mbps down and 40mbps up. Signal strength metrics for both AT&T and Verizon were comparable, indicating that the performance issue may not be related to signal quality. Another user reported similar issues with their MAX BR1 LTEA, achieving speeds under 10mbps while connected to AT&T on band 12, despite better performance on a mobile device.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo address reduced speed when connecting to home WiFi via a Pepwave Max BR1 MK2 LTEA, it is recommended to check the WiFi WAN settings to ensure the channel width is set to 20/40 MHz for potentially better throughput. Additionally, signal strength should be assessed, as the positioning of the rooftop antenna may cause attenuation due to metal walls and roofs of the trailer, which can affect the WiFi signal quality when parked close to the home router.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Pepwave MAX BR1 Pro LTE-A has a router throughput of up to 200 Mbps with firmware version 7.0.1, while the Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini LTE-A has a maximum throughput of 100 Mbps. For users considering an upgrade from the MAX BR1, the BR1 Pro LTE-A offers a better LTE-A experience compared to the BR1 Mini.\n\n## Document_16\n\nWi-Fi speeds on the Pepwave MAX HD2 LTE are significantly lower (0 - 0.5 Mbps) when connected to a Netgear GS748TV5 switch, while LAN speeds are around 15 Mbps. Disconnecting the LAN ports from the switch restores Wi-Fi speeds to normal levels of 15 Mbps. The Pepwave is connected to a Mikrotik RB2011UiAS-2HnD-IN router, which is locked down and does not allow access to its settings. The Pepwave's WAN connection uses DHCP with a specific IP address and gateway, while the LAN is configured with a static IP and DHCP enabled. The AP settings are configured for 2.4GHz operation in Germany, with various parameters set to default, including channel width and output power.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo improve poor performance with the AP One 300M, it is advisable to check the transmit power settings, which are configurable on the Advanced Wireless Tab. Additionally, ensure that both antennas are attached and verify that the selected channel is not saturated by other wireless devices, as this can affect signal quality.\n\n## Document_18\n\nTo address poor performance with the AP One, which is exhibiting a maximum throughput of 15Mbps while direct connections yield around 70Mbps, it is suggested to investigate potential interference or noise issues. Changing the wireless channel on the AP One may help improve performance, with common channels being 1, 6, and 11. Utilizing a program like InSSIDer can assist in determining the optimal channel to reduce interference.\n\n## Document_19\n\nWhen experiencing poor performance with an AP One, it is suggested to check the power settings, as excessive power output can negatively impact performance. Additionally, interference from other 2.4 GHz devices, such as phones or baby monitors, should be considered as potential sources of radio frequency interference (RFI) that could affect throughput.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe user is experiencing lower speed test results on a Pepwave BR1 Mini connected to Vodafone Egypt despite having a strong signal (-66dbm). It is suggested that RF noise may be affecting performance. Additionally, a firmware upgrade to version 8.0 is recommended to potentially improve the situation.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo improve the performance of a Pepwave BR1 Max LTE router, it is recommended to upgrade the firmware to version 6.3.4 and then to 7.1.0. The firmware can be found in the Pepwave archive by selecting the MAX BR1 model. Additionally, updating the cellular module firmware is advised, which can be done through the support.cgi page by navigating to the cellular module firmware upgrade section and checking for updates.\n\n## Document_22\n\nThe BR1 MK2 LTEA is expected to have limited availability in August, with a more general release anticipated in September. This suggests that users considering an upgrade from the MAX BR1 to the BR1 Mini for LTE-A functionality may want to wait for the updated BR1 model to become available.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe MAX-BR1-MK2-LTEA-W-T model of the Pepwave MAX BR1 supports both US and EU bands, allowing for a single model to be used across different regions without needing separate versions for each band.\n\n## Document_24\n\nThe AP One is designed to have high output power, which should provide better performance compared to consumer-grade Wi-Fi units. However, if the throughput is limited to a maximum of 15Mbps while direct connections to the router yield around 70Mbps, it may indicate a potential issue with the unit itself. In such cases, it is advisable to consider returning the unit for a replacement or RMA to conduct further testing.\n\n",

    "query": "For a technician troubleshooting slow WiFi and cellular speeds on a Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini LTEA, what multi-step diagnostic and optimization actions should be taken, considering hardware, configuration, signal, and firmware factors?",
    "answer": "A technician should approach slow speeds on the Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini LTEA with a comprehensive diagnostic and optimization process. First, check the WiFi hardware, ensuring antennas are properly installed and not loose, and consider relocating the device to reduce interference and improve signal quality. Next, review WiFi configuration: try changing the wireless channel and adjusting transmit power (either increasing or decreasing), and set the channel width to 20/40MHz if using WiFi WAN. Since the device uses 2.4GHz 802.11n with one spatial stream, real-world speeds will be 40-45% of the PHY rate, so manage expectations accordingly. For cellular issues, verify both diversity and main antennas are installed, reposition them, and assess signal metrics like SINR, RSRQ, and Ec/Io; poor values suggest the need for a directional antenna or efforts to reduce local RF noise. Compare connection types: if the BR1 Mini connects only to 3G, speeds will be lower than phones using 4G LTE with the same SIM. Also, check for firmware updates (upgrade to at least 8.0.2) to resolve known issues and improve performance. Finally, avoid using the BR1 Mini for both WiFi WAN and LAN AP simultaneously, as its single-band, non-MIMO hardware will further reduce speeds; use a dedicated AP for LAN devices if possible.",

The fix is expected to be included in the next general availability (GA) firmware release.\n\n## Document_2\n\nTo configure a Peplink Balance 310 5G to run traffic through SpeedFusion Cloud when the primary WAN connection goes down, set up the SpeedFusion Cloud connection to the nearest point of presence. Create an outbound policy named 'priority' with the wired WAN at the top of the list and SpeedFusion Cloud next, ensuring to tick the option to terminate sessions on link recovery before saving and applying the settings.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe Bandwidth Control feature on the PePLink Balance 710 is designed to manage traffic based on the source IP addresses or subnets of LAN and PPTP clients, allowing different bandwidth and traffic prioritization policies for user groups such as Manager, Staff, and Guest. It typically applies to internal (private) IP addresses rather than external (public) IP addresses, and does not restrict traffic to specific external sites. Currently, there is no functionality to shape traffic directed to particular external destinations, but this could be considered for future development.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Peplink Balance 380 has a maximum limit of 50 concurrent OpenVPN connections. When this limit is reached, additional users attempting to connect will be blocked from establishing a VPN session.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe Peplink Balance 380 supports a maximum of 50 concurrent OpenVPN connections, as stated in the documentation. This limit is not just a recommendation; it is a hard-coded restriction. If a 51st VPN user attempts to connect, they will be blocked from establishing a VPN connection until one of the existing users disconnects, as the device cannot handle more than the specified number of concurrent connections.\n\n## Document_6\n\nWhen configuring a Peplink Balance 580 with two WAN connections for outbound DNS resolution, it is important to note that the secondary DNS server will only be used if the primary DNS server is unresponsive. The DNS traffic analysis may show internal NATted IP addresses, such as 192.168.17.198, instead of the queried external web addresses or IPs. To gain better visibility into DNS queries and responses across the network, setting up a syslog server can be beneficial.\n\n## Document_7\n\nWhen aggregating multiple internet connections using a Peplink Balance 580, the type of speed test conducted can significantly impact the results, as browser-based tests typically utilize a single session and may not effectively leverage all available WAN connections. Satellite connections often have high latency (around 800ms on KA band), which can hinder performance compared to DSL connections that have lower latency (20-50ms). For optimal performance, it is suggested to use the satellite link as a backup only, as it can negatively affect the overall speed and latency of the load-balanced connections.\n\n## Document_8\n\nWhen aggregating multiple internet connections using a Peplink Balance 580, the inclusion of a satellite connection with high latency can negatively impact overall speed. Specifically, the satellite connection should not be aggregated with DSL lines, as the high latency of the satellite connection can slow down the entire SpeedFusion VPN tunnel. It is recommended to combine satellite connections only with other satellite connections, while landlines can be effectively combined with cellular connections for better performance.\n\n## Document_9\n\nTo route all SIP traffic through a T1 line with failover to a cable line on a Peplink Balance 580, outbound rules using IP addresses are recommended. Issues may arise when new devices connect to the network, as they can inadvertently use the T1 line, causing congestion for voice traffic. It is important to define outbound policies carefully and ensure that all devices are accounted for in the rules to maintain optimal performance.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo allow both internal and external access to an NVR for IP CCTV cameras using a Peplink Balance Core, a local DNS record can be set up to resolve the domain name (e.g., abc.domain.com) to the internal IP address (e.g., 192.168.50.10) when accessed from within the local network. This setup prevents the traffic from being routed externally and back to the NVR. Additionally, user devices should be configured to obtain DHCP IP addresses from the Balance Core, which will serve as the local DNS server.\n\n## Document_11\n\nTo establish a backup connection for Offices B and C in the event of an MPLS failure, a Peplink Balance can be installed in both offices with ADSL lines connected for redundancy. A PepVPN can be set up from Offices B and C to HQ over the MPLS connection, but it is also possible to create a PepVPN from Offices B and C to Office A, which would then route traffic to HQ via the existing PepVPN. Additionally, it is feasible to configure the Peplink Balance in Offices B and C to failover to the ADSL lines and utilize a PepVPN when the MPLS connection is down, allowing for continued operation during outages.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe Peplink Balance series of routers, such as the Balance 30, offers comprehensive bandwidth monitoring features that allow users to track data usage across all WAN connections, including 3G, 4G, cable, and DSL. Users can view real-time data statistics, including total download and upload amounts, and analyze data spikes through graphical representations. The system provides daily and monthly overviews of data consumption, enabling users to identify specific devices or IP addresses that may be consuming excessive data. Additionally, the routers support seamless failover between connections and allow users to set data usage limits to prevent overage charges, particularly useful in usage-based billing scenarios. Notifications can be configured to alert users when operating on more expensive connections, and quality of service settings can be adjusted to prioritize bandwidth allocation based on individual user needs.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Peplink Balance 310 5G modem is designed for branch offices and rural home users, featuring dual modems: a primary 5G modem with a theoretical maximum download speed of 4 Gbps and a secondary Category 12 modem with a maximum download speed of 600 Mbps. It supports up to four SIM cards (two for each modem) and includes five gigabit LAN ports, two SFP slots for fiber connections, and a USB port for adding a third cellular modem. The device is capable of SpeedFusion technology to bond multiple internet connections, making it suitable for failover scenarios. It does not have built-in Wi-Fi but can control external Wi-Fi access points, allowing for extensive wireless network setups. The modem supports a maximum throughput of 1 Gbps and can handle up to 600 Mbps for unencrypted VPN tunnels and 500 Mbps for encrypted tunnels. Additionally, it features a locking power connector to prevent accidental disconnection and is equipped with six cellular antennas for optimal connectivity.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe Balance 310 5G from Peplink features antennas capable of operating up to 2.7 GHz, providing four connections for a 5G modem and two for a category 12 modem. It includes a 60-watt power supply at 12 volts, which requires appropriate gauge wiring for mobile applications. While the device does not have built-in Wi-Fi, it supports the integration of Peplink wireless access points, allowing for automatic provisioning and management of multiple access points under a single SSID. The router has a maximum throughput of one gigabit and supports PepVPN with up to 600 megabits for unencrypted tunnels and 500 megabits for encrypted tunnels using 256-bit encryption. This makes it suitable for both high-speed internet access and secure site-to-site connectivity.\n\n## Document_15\n\nWhen configuring a Peplink Balance 580 with two WAN connections, it is important to set the DNS servers correctly for outbound DNS resolution. If a secondary DNS server is used, issues may arise where the DNS queries do not return expected results, potentially due to misconfigurations or external factors such as ISP redirection. In this case, the logs showed an unexpected IP address, indicating a possible issue with hostname resolution or DNS server order. Reversing the DNS server order might help in troubleshooting the issue, and contacting Peplink support for further diagnostics may be necessary.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo optimize the performance of a Peplink Balance 580 when aggregating multiple internet connections, outbound policy settings such as Weighted Balance can be defined to effectively load balance traffic across the 5 WAN connections. This approach can help manage the differing speeds and characteristics of DSL and satellite connections, potentially allowing for more efficient use of available bandwidth.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe user is running a Peplink Balance 580 to aggregate five internet connections: one satellite connection with 10 Mbps upload/download and four Bell DSL lines that combine for 20 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload. The user has observed that disabling the DSL lines sometimes results in better connection speeds than when they are enabled. The user experiences inconsistent performance, noting that they cannot achieve full speeds through the Peplink device, while direct connection to the satellite provides the expected 10 Mbps speeds.\n\n## Document_18\n\nTo ensure that SIP traffic is routed through a T1 line with failover to cable lines on a Peplink Balance 580, it is recommended to dedicate a VLAN for the Voice network. The outbound policy should source from the voice network and target trusted host networks, using UDP or TCP protocols. The algorithm should be set to priority for the circuits, avoiding load balancing for voice traffic to prevent issues such as one-way audio or registration problems during calls.\n\n## Document_19\n\nTo set up a backup connection for Offices B and C in case the MPLS link to Office A goes down, a Peplink Balance can be installed in both offices with ADSL lines connected for backup. By enabling expert mode under outbound policies and defining the remote ends network under destination using the Priority algorithm, the MPLS link can be set as the top connection priority, while the PepVPN over ADSL lines can be set as the secondary option. This configuration ensures that all traffic is routed through MPLS unless it fails, at which point traffic will automatically switch to the PepVPN connection.\n\n",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nThe Balance TWO router supports bonding of all 4 LAN ports using the 802.3ad protocol, which allows for link aggregation to increase bandwidth between the router and a switch that supports LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol).\n\n## Document_2\n\nTo troubleshoot the dynamic DNS update feature on Peplink routers, it is suggested to verify if the 'Find My Peplink Address' service in InControl2 can successfully connect to a known DDNS service. This can help determine if the issue lies with the router's configuration or the DDNS service itself.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe MediaFast 500 supports all 8 load balancing algorithms, contrary to the initial impression that it only supports 7. This indicates that the specifications for the MediaFast family may not be fully representative of its capabilities regarding load balancing algorithms.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe throughput speed of the Peplink Balance 20 is dependent on the hardware revision and the firmware version. The current model supports a throughput of 150 Mbps when on the latest firmware.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe older Peplink Balance 20 model has a hardware revision that limits its throughput to 100 Mbps, which explains the reduced download speeds observed when the router is connected. In contrast, newer hardware revisions of the Balance 20 can support speeds up to 150 Mbps. Therefore, the performance drop when using the router is likely due to its hardware limitations rather than a configuration issue.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Balance 20 router has a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, which can be exceeded by a 500Mbps WAN connection, potentially leading to performance issues such as high CPU usage and unresponsiveness during large downloads. Users have reported that actual throughput under real-world conditions can be significantly lower than the advertised specifications, with some suggesting that actual throughput may be about one-third of the raw throughput under ideal conditions. In contrast, other Peplink devices, like the Balance 20X, can achieve higher throughput, with reports of 900+ Mbps on 1Gbps fiber connections.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe Peplink Balance One is rated for 600Mbps throughput, but the user is experiencing download speeds between 260Mbps and 303Mbps, which is significantly lower than expected. In contrast, a pfSense box connected in the same manner achieves over 500Mbps download speeds, indicating that the issue may not be with the internet connection itself, as there are no errors or collisions reported on the Peplink device.\n\n## Document_8\n\nIn configuring High Availability (HA) between two Peplink 710 units, the synchronization of configuration changes from the master to the slave unit requires manual intervention. This indicates a limitation in the Peplink Balance system, as the client desires automatic synchronization of configurations without administrative effort whenever changes are made in the master unit.\n\n## Document_9\n\nIn bonding multiple internet connections using Peplink's SpeedFusion technology, WAN latency is crucial for optimal performance. High latency connections can significantly reduce overall throughput. For example, combining low-latency cable connections with high-latency DSL connections can lead to diminished speed improvements. It is recommended to monitor WAN circuits for speed, drop rate, and latency through the router's dashboard. If latency varies significantly (more than 75-100ms) among connections, it can further decrease bonding capacity. For applications like VoIP, maintaining latency below 150ms is ideal.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo set up Peplink Balance VPNs for mobile smart devices using public unencrypted WiFi, it is recommended to use L2TP. Instructions for setting up L2TP with IPsec can be found in the Peplink knowledge base.\n\n## Document_11\n\nWhen using a Peplink Balance 20 with multiple WAN connections, normal internet traffic will load balance between the WANs, which can lead to inconsistent performance during activities like streaming and browsing. Speedtest.net may show higher results because it tests the combined bandwidth of both connections. To configure the device for better performance, users can access the Peplink console at 192.168.1.1 and set outbound policy rules to optimize traffic based on their specific needs.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo troubleshoot performance issues with a PEPLINK BALANCE 20 when connected to a 50 Mbps fiber optic internet connection and a 10 Mbps phone internet service, it is suggested to reset the router to default settings using the reset button. Despite speed tests showing higher results, the user experiences slower and unstable performance when streaming media and surfing the web, indicating potential issues with the configuration or ISP service.\n\n## Document_13\n\nTo troubleshoot low download speeds on a Peplink Balance 20 when connected through an ADSL modem/router, it is suggested to utilize the DSL optimization feature. It is acknowledged that there will be some loss of throughput due to the additional hop through the router, but the extent of the loss should not be as significant as reported. Additionally, using Wi-Fi can further reduce speeds due to the encryption algorithm involved.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo troubleshoot low download speeds on a Peplink Balance 20 when connected to an ADSL modem/router, check for any bandwidth allocations or reservations set up for user groups that may limit throughput. Ensure that the upload and download speeds are configured correctly in the WAN settings, and consider doubling the capabilities to see if it improves performance. Additionally, be aware that a managed switch in the connection path may introduce latency, and proprietary features of the modem may affect speed based on device compatibility.\n\n## Document_15\n\nTo address slow download speeds on a Peplink Balance 20 Router when connected to a Motorola NVG510 modem, it is recommended to check and fix the port speed and duplex mode settings for the WAN interface of both the Peplink router and the modem. This adjustment may help improve the download speed performance.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo address slow download speeds when using a Peplink Balance 20 Router with an ATT DSL service, it is recommended to try setting the connection to 100M Full Duplex (FD) instead of AUTO, as some modems may be sensitive to this setting. Additionally, checking the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) setting is important; for DSL connections, it should typically be set to 1492 to optimize performance.\n\n## Document_17\n\nWhen experiencing slow download speeds with a Peplink Balance 20 Router, it is important to check the configuration settings, including WAN interface settings which should be set to Auto/Auto for proper connection to the carrier router. In cases where bandwidth degradation occurs only when the Peplink is in use, it may be beneficial to investigate the Peplink interfaces for errors or performance issues, as well as to ensure that outbound policies and bandwidth limits are not inadvertently affecting performance. Additionally, using Drop-in mode may impact the routing and performance, so reviewing this setup could also be necessary.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 router has a maximum rated throughput of 100 Mbps, which is likely causing the observed throughput limitation when connected to a 250 Mbps cable connection. For higher throughput needs, upgrading to a Peplink Balance One, which supports over 600 Mbps, is recommended.\n\n## Document_19\n\nWhen configuring a Peplink Balance 20 for load balancing with two ADSL connections and a mobile 4G backup, it is important to note that defining WAN download/upload speeds can limit the available upload speed for the WAN to 256kb. This means that performing a speed test using WAN1 will yield only 256kb upload speeds. For optimal performance and prioritization of traffic, further assistance through a support ticket may be necessary.\n\n## Document_20\n\nIn a setup involving a Peplink Balance 50 connected to four internet connections (two 175 Mbps fiber and two 80 Mbps cable), low throughput issues can arise even when sufficient bandwidth is available. Factors such as layer 2 switching limitations and configuration settings may affect the overall performance. In a related scenario with a Peplink Balance 20 connected to a CISCO box, low bandwidth measurements were reported despite a high-speed connection from the ISP. The device's performance can be influenced by firmware versions and network configurations, which may need to be optimized to improve download and upload speeds.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo achieve higher download speeds with a Peplink Balance router, it is recommended to use a Balance 305 or a model rated for higher throughput, as the Balance 20 is rated for a maximum of 200Mbps. This may explain the slower speeds experienced when routing through the Peplink device compared to a direct connection to the ISP's router.\n\n## Document_22\n\nWhen using a Peplink Balance 210 with two WAN connections, a user reported a significant drop in download speeds from 100mbps to 30mbps when routing through the device. The user noted that directly connecting to the cable connection yielded expected speeds, but the Peplink device limited the throughput to a maximum of 9mbps, raising concerns about the performance and capability of the router given its price point.\n\n## Document_23\n\nWhen experiencing slower internet speeds through a Peplink router compared to a direct modem connection, it is suggested to test the individual connections to assess their metrics. The Peplink Balance 20 does not support SpeedFusion technology, but it can still perform load balancing between connections. Additionally, updating the firmware to version 5.4.9 may help improve performance.\n\n## Document_24\n\nTo troubleshoot the dynamic DNS update feature on Pepwave routers, it is suggested to test the same credentials with another device, such as a Windows computer using no-ip's Dynamic Update Client (DUC). If the credentials work on another device, it may indicate an issue with the router configuration or firmware. Users have reported successful dynamic DNS updates with both Balance One and 30LTE routers running firmware version 8.0.2 using no-ip.com.\n\n## Document_25\n\nTo troubleshoot the dynamic DNS update feature on Pepwave routers, it is important to confirm that the hostname can successfully receive an update. The error message 'Internal error' indicates a failure in the update process for WAN 1, which may require checking the configuration settings as outlined in relevant support articles.\n\n## Document_26\n\nThe Balance MediaFast family of products supports 7 load balancing algorithms, while the BALANCE family supports 8. The missing algorithm is likely 'fastest response time', which was added most recently. However, it is also possible that the MediaFast reference and datasheets are outdated.\n\n## Document_27\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a throughput speed that can vary between 100 Mbps and 150 Mbps, which may depend on factors such as firmware or hardware configurations. To verify the actual throughput speed, it is recommended to test the connection directly to the WAN using a PC, rather than through a gigabit rated switch.\n\n## Document_28\n\nThe throughput speed of the Peplink Balance 20 can be either 100 Mbps or 150 Mbps, which may depend on the specific hardware version or firmware. The R6 model is expected to achieve the higher throughput of 150 Mbps.\n\n## Document_29\n\nThe Balance 20 router has a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, which can be exceeded by a 500Mbps WAN connection. When a large file download occurs, it can consume all of the router's resources, leading to unresponsiveness and high CPU usage, which is expected behavior for this model. The Balance 20 may not handle high traffic volumes gracefully, and it is suggested that a more capable device, such as the Balance 20X, would be better suited for handling multiple simultaneous activities without performance degradation.\n\n## Document_30\n\nThe Balance 20 router may struggle with high bandwidth connections, such as a 500Mb/sec WAN, leading to performance issues like high CPU usage and unresponsiveness during large downloads. To mitigate this, it is recommended to set the Upload Bandwidth setting for the fiber connection to 120 Mbps to throttle the WAN interface. Additionally, implementing group bandwidth limits can help manage download rates on the client side.\n\n## Document_31\n\nThe Balance 20 router may experience performance issues such as unresponsiveness and high CPU usage during large file downloads, potentially due to Bufferbloat. While Peplink has implemented fq_codel for uploads under the Mitigate Bufferbloat setting, it currently does not support downloads, with a fix expected in version 9. Users can enable the 'DSL cable optimization' feature to prioritize certain types of traffic, which may help improve Bufferbloat performance until the download support is available.\n\n## Document_32\n\nWhen using a Peplink Balance One rated for 600Mbps throughput, users may experience lower download speeds, such as between 260Mbps and 311Mbps, despite achieving over 500Mbps on a pfSense box under the same conditions. Adjusting the MTU settings to auto can result in a maximum speed of 311Mbps.\n\n## Document_33\n\nThe Peplink Balance One is rated for 600Mbps throughput, but users may experience lower download speeds, such as between 260Mbps and 303Mbps, when compared to other devices like pfSense that can achieve over 500Mbps under the same conditions. This discrepancy may indicate potential configuration issues or limitations within the Peplink device.\n\n## Document_34\n\nTo troubleshoot lower than expected download speeds on a Peplink Balance One, it is suggested to connect a laptop directly to LAN port 2 and monitor the laptop's CPU load during the speed test. High CPU usage on the laptop can limit throughput, potentially causing speeds to not exceed 300Mbps despite the device's rated capability of 600Mbps and the ISP providing over 500Mbps.\n\n## Document_35\n\nTo troubleshoot lower than expected download speeds on a Peplink Balance One, it is suggested to test the device using a Linux operating system, as it has shown consistent throughput in testing. In contrast, testing on macOS and Windows operating systems may yield less reliable results.\n\n",

    "query": "What are the main causes and troubleshooting steps for low download speeds when using a Peplink Balance 20 router, especially when the ISP connection is faster than the router's rated throughput?",
    "answer": "The most common cause of low download speeds on the Peplink Balance 20 router is hitting its hardware throughput limit, which can be 100 Mbps or 150 Mbps depending on the hardware revision and firmware version. If your ISP connection is faster, this hardware cap will bottleneck your speed. During large downloads or high traffic, the Balance 20 may become unresponsive or show high CPU usage, particularly if the WAN connection is much faster than the router can process. Other factors that can contribute to low speeds include misconfigured WAN interface port speed or duplex settings, improper MTU size (especially for DSL), suboptimal outbound policies, bandwidth limits set in the router, and the presence of managed switches or additional routing hops that add latency. To troubleshoot, verify your router’s hardware revision and firmware version to confirm its throughput rating; test your connection by bypassing the router to isolate the issue; check and adjust WAN interface settings (such as fixed port speed/duplex and MTU); ensure there are no unnecessary bandwidth limits or group reservations; and consider using features like DSL optimization or bufferbloat mitigation. If your needs exceed the Balance 20’s capabilities, upgrading to a higher-throughput model such as the Balance One or 20X is recommended.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nFor transitioning from a single-WAN to a Multi-WAN environment, the Peplink Balance 210 and higher models support the Authoritative DNS feature, which can assist in managing DNS records such as MX and PTR for email services. This feature is beneficial for ensuring proper DNS handling when adding redundancy with another ISP.\n\n## Document_2\n\nFor a requirement involving inbound and outbound ISP load balancing along with DNS server capabilities, a Peplink device can be configured to handle both functions. The device should be set up to manage DNS records, including A records, directly on the Peplink device instead of relying on a third-party DNS server. This setup will allow for the removal of existing DNS entries from the third-party vendor and ensure that the Peplink device handles all DNS configurations accordingly while balancing the ISP load.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe Peplink Balance can serve as an authoritative DNS server to facilitate inbound load balancing and failover. For specific guidance on implementing inbound load balancing, users can refer to the Peplink knowledgebase for detailed instructions.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe congestion or saturation of a WAN connection using the overflow algorithm is influenced by the bandwidth settings of the WAN interfaces. In a specific case with WAN 1 being a fiber circuit with a theoretical download speed of 100Mb/s and WAN 2 being a satellite link with a download speed of 2Mb/s, the actual bandwidth available on the fiber circuit is uncertain. Despite setting a high bandwidth value to utilize the available capacity, traffic is still observed on the lower priority WAN 2, indicating that the overflow algorithm is directing traffic to this link even when the higher capacity WAN 1 has not reached its maximum potential.\n\n## Document_5\n\nPeplink Balance routers support inbound load balancing, allowing external users to connect to a server using a DNS name. The router acts as the authoritative DNS server for the domain, resolving the domain name to an active Public WAN IP. If a WAN link fails, the router will only respond to DNS requests with the Public IPs of WANs that are currently live, ensuring continuous connectivity without changing the public IP or causing disconnections.\n\n## Document_6\n\nFor the Peplink Balance 210 to utilize the authoritative DNS feature effectively, fixed IP addresses are required for each WAN connection. This means that both WAN accounts need to have static IP addresses to ensure proper DNS routing and failover functionality.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe Peplink Balance 210 and higher models have a built-in authoritative DNS server that can facilitate inbound load balancing and failover. This feature allows for automatic DNS updates when the primary WAN goes down and the backup WAN comes up, regardless of whether the WAN IPs are static or dynamic.\n\n## Document_8\n\nFor a Peplink Balance 310 configured for inbound and outbound load balancing, if DNS lookups fail when WAN 1 (multiple static IP Internet leased line) is down, it is crucial to ensure that the DNS records at the domain name registrar are correctly pointing to the Peplink device. Proper configuration of DNS settings is essential for maintaining functionality during WAN failover.\n\n## Document_9\n\nPeplink Balance models 210 and above can be configured to act as the authoritative DNS server for a domain and provide inbound load balancing between two ISPs. This setup ensures that if one ISP goes down, the Balance will not advertise the down link, allowing the website to remain available through the other ISP without delay.\n\n## Document_10\n\nPeplink Balance models 210, 310, 305, 380, 580, 710, and 1350 have a built-in DNS server that supports Inbound Load Balancing, which distributes inbound data traffic over multiple WAN links. This functionality is configured using DNS records within Peplink Balance and external DNS records at an authoritative DNS server. When a client queries for a domain like foobar.com, the authoritative DNS server delegates resolution to Peplink Balance, which can return IP addresses corresponding to available WAN links. If both WAN links are operational, both IP addresses are returned; if one is down, only the operational IP address is returned. Peplink Balance 20 and 30 do not support authoritative DNS functionality.\n\n## Document_11\n\nInbound Load Balancing on Peplink Balance devices distributes inbound data traffic over multiple WAN links to computers or servers behind the router. Models such as the Peplink Balance 210, 310, 305, 380, 580, 710, and 1350 include a built-in DNS server that supports this functionality, while the Balance 20 and 30 do not. Inbound Load Balancing can be configured using DNS records within Peplink Balance or through external DNS records at an authoritative DNS server. When Peplink Balance acts as an authoritative DNS server, it resolves hostnames by returning IP addresses corresponding to available WAN links, allowing for load balancing based on WAN link status.\n\n## Document_12\n\nPeplink Balance models 210, 310, 305, 380, 580, 710, and 1350 support Inbound Load Balancing through a built-in DNS server, which allows for the distribution of inbound data traffic over multiple WAN links to servers behind the router. This functionality is not available on the Peplink Balance 20 and 30. Inbound Load Balancing can be configured using DNS records within Peplink Balance or by delegating a sub-domain to Peplink from an external authoritative DNS server. When a client queries the Peplink DNS server for a domain, the server responds with the IP addresses corresponding to the available WAN links, ensuring traffic is balanced based on WAN availability.\n\n## Document_13\n\nInbound Load Balancing on Peplink Balance routers distributes inbound data traffic over multiple WAN links to computers or servers behind the device. Models such as the Peplink Balance 210, 310, 305, 380, 580, 710, and 1350 have a built-in DNS server that facilitates this functionality, while the Peplink Balance 20 and 30 do not. Configuration can be done through DNS records within Peplink Balance or by delegating a sub-domain to Peplink from an external authoritative DNS server. The DNS server responds to queries by returning IP addresses corresponding to available WAN links, utilizing a Round Robin algorithm for load balancing or allowing for a primary WAN with failover capabilities to another WAN if the primary fails.\n\n## Document_14\n\nInbound Load Balancing on Peplink Balance devices distributes inbound data traffic over multiple WAN links to computers or servers behind the router. Models such as the Peplink Balance 210, 310, 305, 380, 580, 710, and 1350 include a built-in DNS server that facilitates this functionality, while the Balance 20 and 30 do not. Configuration involves setting DNS records within Peplink Balance or delegating a sub-domain to Peplink. When a client queries the DNS for a domain, Peplink Balance responds with IP addresses corresponding to available WAN links, ensuring traffic is balanced across them. If one WAN link is down, the DNS protocol allows the client to query the other available WAN link for resolution.\n\n## Document_15\n\nInbound Load Balancing on Peplink Balance routers distributes inbound data traffic over multiple WAN links to servers behind the router. Models such as the Peplink Balance 210, 310, 305, 380, 580, 710, and 1350 have a built-in DNS server that supports this functionality, while the Balance 20 and 30 do not. Configuration can be done through DNS records within Peplink Balance or by delegating a sub-domain to Peplink. When a client queries the Peplink DNS server for a domain, the server returns IP addresses corresponding to available WAN links, enabling traffic distribution. For this setup to function correctly, a static IP is required on each ISP connection.\n\n## Document_16\n\nPeplink Balance models 210, 310, 305, 380, 580, 710, and 1350 feature a built-in DNS server that supports Inbound Load Balancing, allowing distribution of inbound data traffic over multiple WAN links to servers behind the device. The DNS server can be configured to hold all domain records, and modifications to the Name Server record at the Domain Registrar are necessary for migration. When a client queries the Peplink DNS server, it returns IP addresses corresponding to available WAN links, facilitating load balancing. If a WAN connection fails, the DNS query mechanism allows for fallback to an alternate WAN, but there may be a delay in routing new requests to the alternate connection if the primary WAN is down, depending on the configuration and settings of the device.\n\n## Document_17\n\nInbound Load Balancing on Peplink Balance devices distributes inbound data traffic over multiple WAN links to servers behind the router.

It is important to select the appropriate model based on specific needs, and consulting a local certified Peplink partner is recommended for tailored guidance. Additionally, considerations for managing email DNS records (MX and PTR) should be addressed during the setup process.\n\n## Document_21\n\nThe overflow algorithm in WAN connections operates by redirecting traffic from the primary WAN interface to a secondary WAN when the primary reaches a specified bandwidth threshold, typically set at 90% of its capacity. For example, if a fiber circuit on WAN 1 is configured for 100/100 Mbps and reaches 90% utilization, traffic will overflow to the next WAN in the outbound policy. This is particularly useful in scenarios with limited bandwidth, such as using a T1 line for VoIP phones, where traffic can overflow to a less stable ADSL circuit when the T1 reaches its capacity.\n\n## Document_22\n\nTo ensure accurate calculation of congestion or saturation on a WAN connection by a Peplink Balance device, it is essential to set the appropriate bandwidth thresholds for each WAN interface. Users should verify that they are running the latest firmware version (6.3.2) and ensure correct duplex settings when connecting fiber circuits to the Balance device, as incorrect duplex settings can significantly affect bandwidth. In cases like Cogent, hard coding the duplex on the interface may be necessary to achieve the correct bandwidth. After applying WAN traffic shaping, a hard reboot of the Balance device is recommended for optimal performance.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe discussion highlights the challenges of managing WAN connections with variable bandwidth, particularly in a project involving a fiber circuit with non-guaranteed bandwidth and a satellite connection with a committed information rate (CIR). The satellite connection has a maximum traffic flow of 1Mb/s but guarantees only 100 Kb/s for downlink and 19.2 Kb/s for uplink. The user is seeking advice on the best algorithm to set for managing these WAN connections effectively, considering the fluctuating availability of bandwidth.\n\n## Document_24\n\nTo understand how the overflow algorithm works for WAN connections, it is recommended to upgrade the firmware to the latest version, analyze active sessions to identify the most used applications and devices, and segment high-usage devices into separate VLANs with bandwidth reservations. Quality of Service (QoS) should be applied to important applications, and outbound policies can be configured to manage traffic based on application usage and device load. Additionally, using a FusionHub license to create a SpeedFusion peer can help bond upload bandwidth, enhancing overall throughput.\n\n",

For failover capabilities between SIMs and campground Wi-Fi, the device can be configured accordingly. Channel bonding can enhance connection capacity, but it may require additional licensing. WAN smoothing can be used to duplicate data rather than double bandwidth, and enabling Forward Error Correction (FEC) can provide added protection against lost packets, though it may reduce the maximum achievable speed.\n\n## Document_9\n\nTo enable the use of both cellular connections on a Pepwave MAX Transit Duo for SpeedFusion traffic, one can bond the two cellular connections on the Transit. This allows the MAX HD2 IP67 to utilize the bonded tunnel as a transport for its SpeedFusion VPN traffic, thereby spreading the tunnel across both connections.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Pepwave Transit Duo features dual cellular modems that can utilize two SIM cards simultaneously, with a third SIM card serving as a backup for one of the modems. SpeedFusion bonding is not automatically enabled; it requires the appropriate SKU that includes PrimeCare for the first year, which provides 1TB of SpeedFusion Protect data. To enable SpeedFusion bonding, users must access the device configuration web UI and navigate to the SFC Protect tab to enable the feature.\n\n## Document_11\n\nTo create a bonded connection using a single Pepwave Max Transit Duo with two SIM cards, users can utilize SpeedFusion Cloud, which is Peplink's SpeedFusion hosting service. Alternatively, users have the option to host a free-to-license virtual appliance in the cloud themselves, allowing for bonding without the need for additional hardware.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo configure SpeedFusion bonding with a Pepwave MAX Transit (MAX-TST-DUO-LTEA-W), a SpeedFusion tunnel must be created to another Peplink device. A recommended option is to use a free FusionHub Solo license hosted in the cloud. This setup allows for bandwidth aggregation from two SIM cards from different telco/ISP providers, aiming for increased bandwidth and uninterrupted data for applications like gaming and video conferencing.\n\n## Document_13\n\nTo configure SpeedFusion bonding on a Pepwave MAX Transit (MAX-TST-DUO-LTEA-W) with two SIM cards from different telco/ISP providers, one can trial SpeedFusion Cloud for free to test the setup. The goal is to achieve bandwidth aggregation or bonding for increased bandwidth speed and uninterrupted data connectivity, which is particularly beneficial for activities like gaming and Zoom meetings.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe Pepwave MAX Transit (MAX-TST-DUO-LTEA-W) with SpeedFusion bonding can be configured to aggregate bandwidth from two SIM cards from different telco/ISP providers for increased bandwidth and high availability. It is suggested to use priority settings for failover purposes, ensuring that if the primary connection (like FusionHub at Azure) fails, the system will automatically switch to the secondary connection (e.g., T-Mobile).\n\n## Document_15\n\nPeplink's new firmware version 8.1 introduces SpeedFusion Cloud, simplifying the bonding of multiple internet connections, such as cellular, USB tethered, and Ethernet, to enhance speed and reliability. This technology creates a VPN over each connection, which is then combined by a SpeedFusion server in the cloud. The setup process has been streamlined, allowing users to register their device and activate SpeedFusion bonding through the Pepwave dashboard. While the service is not free, it offers a 90-day trial with 100 GB of usage, after which additional data can be purchased. To utilize SpeedFusion Cloud effectively, users need compatible Pepwave routers that support multiple active connections, such as the Max Transit Duo or Balance 20X, which can bond various connection types for improved performance.\n\n## Document_16\n\nPepwave's SpeedFusion technology allows the simultaneous use of two connections, such as cellular and Wi-Fi, by sending a VPN over both connections and combining their speeds and reliability into a single virtual connection. This requires a server on the internet to handle the bonding, which can be hosted on platforms like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, utilizing Pepwave's free bonding server software license. The Max Transit Duo router, priced at $999, supports dual CAT 12 connections and is designed for users needing redundancy and uninterrupted connectivity, allowing both modems to be active simultaneously without manual switching. Testing is ongoing to explore configuration options for mobile users.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe Pepwave MAX Transit Duo is suitable for users needing to work with both AT&T and Verizon, as it has two active cellular radios and supports failover between SIMs and Wi-Fi. It requires a Primecare license renewed annually and a free Solo license for SpeedFusion, which can be hosted at Vultr for a monthly fee. While the device can provide reliability through failover, bandwidth bonding may not be effective due to CPU limitations, and many websites and streaming services may not function properly through the SpeedFusion VPN. For Wi-Fi connectivity, using an Access Point connected to the LAN port can offload Wi-Fi-as-WAN duties from the device's Wi-Fi radio, or a Mikrotik Metal 52 can be used for additional WAN from external Wi-Fi sources.\n\n## Document_18\n\nFor RV users needing connectivity with both AT&T and Verizon, the Pepwave MAX Transit Duo can be a suitable choice, especially if dual SIM slots are required. It allows for failover between SIMs and campground Wi-Fi, but failover only activates during a total loss of connection, not just a slowdown. Users can consider a single modem if they only need one SIM per carrier without failover. Additionally, enabling channel bonding may require additional licensing and could lead to increased data usage, which is a consideration for users with limited data plans.\n\n## Document_19\n\nFor mobile connectivity needs, the Pepwave MAX Transit CAT-18 single modem is suitable for use with multiple SIM cards from different carriers, including AT&T and Verizon. It supports WiFi as WAN functionality, allowing connection to campground WiFi when cellular signals are weak. The Puma 401 antenna can enhance cellular reception, and it is designed to be mounted on a vehicle for optimal performance. The MAX Transit typically maintains connectivity with at least one SIM, with AT&T often providing the highest bandwidth. Licensing may be required for advanced features like channel bonding, but the basic setup can function effectively without them.\n\n## Document_20\n\nIn a setup involving a MAX HD2 IP67 and a MAX Transit Duo, the outbound policy on the Transit Duo determines which cellular connection is utilized for the SpeedFusion connection to the Balance 380. If a session persistence outbound policy is in effect, it may restrict the SpeedFusion connection to only one cellular WAN at a time. To utilize both cellular connections on the Transit Duo, a load balancing outbound policy should be implemented, as a single ongoing session will only use one WAN connection at a time.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo utilize SpeedFusion with a Pepwave Transit Duo for providing reliable Wi-Fi connections, it is important to ensure that SpeedFusion is enabled for the cellular options. The setup can involve using multiple SIM cards to enhance connectivity. Additionally, a configuration example shows that connecting another Pepwave device (like a BR1) as an LTE modem can help in smoothing LTE connections to a SpeedFusion cloud, effectively managing bandwidth and improving performance.\n\n## Document_22\n\nTo achieve bandwidth aggregation or bonding using a Pepwave MAX Transit with SpeedFusion, it is necessary to configure the SpeedFusion setup to utilize two cellular modems (SIM-A and SIM-B) from different ISPs. The goal is to combine the bandwidth from both SIMs for increased speed and high availability, particularly for applications like gaming and video conferencing. However, the user expresses concern that SpeedFusion Cloud may not meet their requirements for this purpose.\n\n## Document_23\n\nTo configure SpeedFusion bonding on a Pepwave MAX Transit router with two SIM cards from different ISPs, it is important to leave off the WAN Smoothing option, as SpeedFusion bonds the two links at the packet level, theoretically doubling throughput. When using SpeedFusion Cloud, the default tunnel should be selected instead of WAN Smoothing. Users may experience some limitations in throughput due to CPU and packet overhead, with reported speeds of around 80Mbps through SpeedFusion compared to higher speeds when using local load balancing with a Weighted Balance Algorithm. Outbound policies can be set to determine which traffic uses the SpeedFusion tunnels versus local connections.\n\n## Document_24\n\nThe Pepwave Max Transit Duo is a dual modem mobile cellular router featuring Cat 12 LTE modems, capable of peak speeds of 600 Mbps down and 150 Mbps up, which is a significant upgrade from the previous Cat 6 modems. It supports simultaneous connections to two carriers, allowing for redundancy and load balancing, and can accommodate up to four SIM cards (two per modem). The router is designed for rugged environments and can be powered through various means, including direct vehicle wiring and USB power adapters. It features Gigabit Ethernet ports and MIMO antennas for both cellular and Wi-Fi connections, supporting dual-band Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) using 802.11ac. The SpeedFusion technology enables the combination of multiple connections for improved speed and reliability, with the option to host a bonding server on platforms like AWS or Azure. The pricing has been reduced significantly, making it more accessible for high-end mobile setups, particularly for users needing reliable internet in vehicles like RVs or buses.\n\n",

    "query": "How can a technician configure a Pepwave MAX Transit Duo to achieve bonded, aggregated bandwidth from both AT&T and Verizon SIMs for high-availability gaming and video conferencing, and what licensing, configuration, and performance considerations must be addressed?",
    "answer": "To achieve bonded, aggregated bandwidth from both AT&T and Verizon SIMs using a Pepwave MAX Transit Duo for high-availability tasks like gaming and video conferencing, the technician should install SIM cards from both carriers into the device’s dual modems. SpeedFusion bonding must be enabled, which is not automatic and requires a PrimeCare license (which includes 1TB of SpeedFusion Protect data for the first year) or the correct SKU, as well as activation via the device’s SFC Protect tab in the web UI. The technician can bond the two cellular connections either by connecting to SpeedFusion Cloud (which offers a free trial and then paid service) or by hosting a FusionHub Solo instance in the cloud (with a free license, but hosting costs). For the best results, both SIMs should be from different ISPs, and the SpeedFusion tunnel should be set up to aggregate bandwidth. Outbound policies should be configured to ensure both connections are used, avoiding session persistence, which would limit traffic to one WAN. WAN Smoothing and Forward Error Correction (FEC) should be disabled if the goal is to maximize throughput, as these features duplicate data and can reduce maximum speed. Performance will depend on device CPU and packet overhead, with real-world bonded throughput potentially lower than the sum of both links. Finally, the technician must consider increased data usage due to bonding and confirm that websites and streaming services function correctly over SpeedFusion VPN, as some may not.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nTo configure VLANs on a Peplink Balance 20 router, it is important to set the port type correctly. For a specific VLAN, such as VLAN 4, the port should be set to 'Access' instead of 'Trunk'. This allows devices connected to that port to receive DHCP assignments from the designated VLAN. After changing the port settings, reconnecting the device should enable it to obtain the correct IP address from the VLAN's DHCP server.\n\n## Document_2\n\nTo set up VLANs for voice and data on a Peplink device, navigate to Network > LAN > Network Settings and use the help icon to define multiple VLANs. Inter-VLAN routing is enabled by default, allowing communication between the defined VLANs. This setup will facilitate the use of both phones and PCs on the same port while ensuring proper routing through the Peplink device.\n\n## Document_3\n\nTo set up a VLAN for a Meraki router on a Peplink Balance 20 without NAT, it is necessary to configure the VLAN settings appropriately. The Peplink Balance allows for full control over which VLANs can communicate on each LAN port, enabling the separation of networks for PCI compliance. Additionally, the use of unmanaged switches is possible with VLAN configuration on the router port, but the specifics of how they will function depend on the overall network setup and VLAN management.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20X allows for the configuration of a Virtual WAN on LAN using Port-Based VLAN. Specifically, VLAN 5 can be set as the Virtual WAN, which reserves that VLAN. Additionally, LAN Port 2 can be configured as an 'Access Port' for VLAN 5, enabling a direct connection of an Internet modem or router to Port 2 as an access or untagged port.\n\n## Document_5\n\nTo create a separate LAN for a neighbor using a Peplink Balance 20, VLANs should be configured. This involves setting up a second tagged VLAN on LAN Port 1 while ensuring that Inter-VLAN routing is turned off for both the existing LAN and the new VLAN. The switch must be configured to recognize VLAN 2 from the Ubiquiti AP and to send only VLAN 2 data packets out the Ethernet port connected to the Balance LAN Port 2. Additionally, the Balance router must be configured to expect VLAN tags on the data packets appropriately.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Peplink Balance 380 does not support Port-Based VLAN settings, which are only available on models below the Balance 305. For detailed model comparisons, users can refer to the Peplink model comparison chart.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe PepLink Balance 310 supports Port Based VLANs and 802.1Q VLAN tagging, which can be configured for different LAN ports. To set up VLANs, the device should be in Bridged mode rather than Router mode, allowing the Balance to manage VLANs. Users can enable VLAN support in the Network settings and create applicable VLANs, then assign these VLANs to specified ports in the Port Settings.\n\n## Document_8\n\nAll Peplink Balance models support port-based VLAN functionality, allowing for network segmentation and management based on specific ports.\n\n## Document_9\n\nTo utilize port-based VLAN features on Peplink devices, firmware version 6.3 or above is required, with the current version being 7.1.2. The port type setting for configuring VLANs can be found under Network > LAN > Port Settings in the device's interface.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo route traffic between two subnets using a Peplink Balance 20, it is necessary to establish VLANs correctly. In this case, VLAN1 has been created on Port 4 with the subnet 192.168.1.x. For devices connected to this port, such as a laptop with a static IP of 192.168.1.250, to communicate with the gateway at 192.168.1.254, the LAN port 4 must be set to access mode on VLAN 1. By default, ports are set to trunk mode on untagged VLANs, which may prevent proper traffic flow.\n\n## Document_11\n\nTo set up port-based VLAN on a Peplink Balance 20, it is important to ensure that the port type for port 4 is set to \"Access\". This configuration is necessary for the correct assignment of subnet IP via DHCP.\n\n## Document_12\n\nFor proper VLAN configuration on a Peplink Balance 20 router, the LAN port must be set to Trunk mode to allow VLAN tags to be managed correctly. When using VLANs, the VLAN tag is attached to network packets by the Wireless Access Point (WAP), and the router processes these packets accordingly. It is also recommended to set up VLANs and SSIDs through InControl2 for better management.\n\n## Document_13\n\nTo set up port-based VLANs on a Peplink Balance 20, configuration can be done under Network > LAN > Port Settings. Inter-VLAN routing is enabled by default, allowing clients from one VLAN to access devices on another VLAN without additional configuration.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo set up a Peplink Balance 20 for redundant network connectivity with 3 VLANs, it is necessary to configure port settings to map individual ports to specific LANs. However, issues may arise where client PCs lose network connectivity after this configuration. Inter-VLAN routing should be enabled to allow communication between different VLANs, such as a client from the 10.10.2.x network accessing another client on the 10.10.1.x network, but it may not function as expected without proper configuration.\n\n## Document_15\n\nTo achieve traffic routing through a specific LAN port on a Pepwave Balance router, one can utilize port-based VLANs to create unique networks assigned to specific LAN ports. This setup can help facilitate access to external networks for devices like NAS and automation servers, even in a double NAT configuration.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo set up a Balance 20X for a cloud-based POS system with VLANs, it is necessary to manage the ports to avoid NAT conflicts. Disabling NAT for the Meraki router while retaining it for the office PCs is not feasible; instead, port forwarding can be configured for the Meraki system along with a static IP address outside the DHCP range. Two VLANs can be established, and the Balance 20X should be set to 'Access' mode for proper VLAN tagging, allowing unmanaged switches to function correctly without issues.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe Balance 20X supports Port-Based VLAN configuration, which can be used for Virtual WAN on LAN without needing an additional Layer 2 switch. However, the specifics regarding the number of Virtual WANs enabled by a single add-on license and the hardware throughput limits while using Virtual WAN on LAN4 are not detailed in the conversation.\n\n## Document_18\n\nTo create a separate LAN for a neighbor using a Peplink Balance 20, one must create a VLAN and disable inter-VLAN routing for both the existing untagged LAN and the new tagged VLAN. This ensures that the two networks remain completely separated. The DHCP server that responds to a new device requesting an address is determined by the VLAN configuration and the device's connection to the network.\n\n## Document_19\n\nTo create a separate LAN for a neighbor using a Peplink Balance 20, VLANs should be set up. A new SSID named 'NeighborNet' should be created and configured to use VLAN 2. Inter-VLAN routing should be turned off for both the existing LAN and the new VLAN to ensure complete separation. The DHCP server's response to a device's request for an address is determined by the VLAN configuration and the SSID the device connects to.\n\n## Document_20\n\nTo create a separate LAN for a neighbor using a Peplink Balance 20, VLANs should be set up to ensure traffic isolation. It is important to turn off Inter-VLAN routing on both the existing LAN and the new tagged VLAN to maintain separation. The DHCP server that responds to a device's request for an address is determined by the VLAN configuration and tagging. Additionally, using a smart switch can help manage traffic, but it requires proper configuration to ensure that traffic is correctly isolated between the two LANs.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo create a separate LAN for a neighbor using a Peplink Balance 20, one should create a new VLAN (VLAN 2) with a different IP subnet and run a DHCP server for it on the Balance 20. This VLAN should be tied to LAN Port 2, which connects to a switch. To ensure isolation, the switch settings should limit the broadcast domain, preventing packets from VLAN 2 from being broadcast to other ports and vice versa. Specifically, set the PVID to 2 and enable ingress checking for the ports connected to VLAN 2 devices, ensuring that traffic is effectively isolated between the two VLANs.\n\n## Document_22\n\nThe PepLink Balance 310 does not support multiple VLAN tagging on the WAN port and forwarding those tagged VLANs to the LAN side. For setups involving multiple VLANs, it is suggested to place the Balance 310 between a router, such as a D-link DIR-850-L, and a network switch to manage the connectivity effectively.\n\n## Document_23\n\nTo enable port-based VLAN support on Peplink devices running firmware version 7, navigate to Network -> LAN -> Network Settings, and in the IP Settings section, click the question mark in the blue circle. This opens a window prompting to define multiple VLANs; clicking 'here' switches the LAN settings to advanced mode with VLAN support. After confirming, apply the changes to enable VLAN functionality.\n\n",

      "To connect a Starlink dish to a Peplink router and manage it via the management app, the dish's IP address (192.168.100.1) needs to be accessible through WAN1. Attempts to configure this include setting outbound policies for all WANs, adding the IP as an additional IP, creating NAT rules, and adjusting firewall settings. However, the IP is only reachable during the initial boot of the dish, indicating it may not respond to pings at other times, complicating the management setup.",
      "To manage a Starlink dish connected to a Peplink Balance router, it may be necessary to pass through the IP address 192.168.100.1 to WAN1. This can potentially be achieved by adding a Static Route for the 192.168.100.0/24 subnet to the gateway IP of the Starlink interface. Additionally, it is noted that running firmware version 8.1.1 may be required for certain features to function correctly in drop-in mode."

    "query": "What are the necessary configuration steps and firmware requirements to reliably access the Starlink dish management interface (192.168.100.1) via a Peplink router, and what are common pitfalls or limitations encountered with different Peplink models or configurations?",
    "answer": "To reliably access the Starlink dish management interface (http://192.168.100.1) via a Peplink router, you must configure the router’s WAN port to DHCP/NAT mode with automatic DNS. The management IP address should be set within the range 192.168.100.2 to 192.168.100.254 (excluding .1), and the recommended firmware is the special version 8.1.1s118, which enables this functionality on compatible Peplink models. After saving and applying these settings, LAN clients should be able to access the Starlink dish interface at 192.168.100.1.\n\nAdditional requirements include ensuring the Peplink’s LAN IP is on a different subnet than the Starlink’s management subnet to avoid routing conflicts. For some Peplink Balance models, attempts to access 192.168.100.1 via outbound policies, NAT rules, or firewall adjustments are often unsuccessful because the Starlink admin interface is only reachable during the dish’s initial boot or may be hidden from ping requests. Some users have found that adding a static route for the 192.168.100.0/24 subnet to the Starlink gateway can help, and that updating firmware via a wired connection is more reliable than Wi-Fi. Note that the Balance One model is not supported. Access issues can also be browser-dependent, with Microsoft Edge sometimes working better than Chrome or Brave. In some cases, using an unmanaged switch or an alternative out-of-band management setup may be necessary for reliable access.\n\nIn summary, use firmware 8.1.1s118, configure WAN for DHCP/NAT with a management IP in 192.168.100.2–.254, and be aware of model limitations and the Starlink device’s behavior regarding admin interface accessibility.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_2\n\nIn drop-in mode, a Peplink Balance can be deployed without altering the existing network configuration, allowing the firewall's default gateway to remain unchanged. The firewall must be positioned on the inside for this setup to function correctly. Public IP addresses can stay on the firewall's outside interface while using drop-in mode, and secondary WAN links can either port forward to the firewall or utilize 1-1 NAT with additional public IP addresses.\n\n## Document_3\n\nDrop-in mode is a configuration for network devices that allows them to be integrated into an existing network without requiring changes to the current network setup. In this mode, the device functions as a transparent bridge, meaning it can pass traffic between the modem and the router without altering the existing firewall rules or routing configurations. This setup allows for the addition of features such as load balancing and failover without disrupting the current network architecture.\n\n## Document_4\n\nDrop-in mode on a Peplink router allows it to be placed between LAN devices and an existing firewall or gateway without requiring configuration changes to the network or access to the existing firewall. In this mode, the Peplink router functions as a Layer 2 bridge between its LAN and WAN ports, using proxy ARP for the original gateway's IP. It intercepts traffic from LAN devices to the original gateway and forwards it accordingly. If the original gateway becomes unavailable, the Peplink can failover to additional WAN connections and also load balance traffic between the original connection and new WANs. The existing firewall, modem, and router continue to operate as they always have without any changes.\n\n## Document_5\n\nTo enable Bonjour Forwarding across VLANs on Peplink routers, specifically from an untagged VLAN to VLAN 20 and vice versa, it is essential to ensure that the router firmware is updated to at least version 8.1.1 RC3, as this version has been reported to successfully facilitate Bonjour broadcasting across VLANs.\n\n## Document_6\n\nTo deploy a Peplink Balance in Drop-in Mode while maintaining existing firewall configurations, it is essential to refer to specific guides on deploying Drop-in Mode and configuring it. For establishing a SpeedFusion tunnel between the Head Office (HO) and Branch Office (BO), additional resources are available that provide a quick guide to building a SpeedFusion connection. Access to hosted servers behind the firewall can be managed through appropriate configurations in the Peplink devices, ensuring that both networks can communicate effectively via the PEPvpn tunnel.\n\n## Document_7\n\nTo set up Peplink Balance VPNs for mobile smart devices using public unencrypted WiFi, it is important to configure the L2TP/IPSEC Preshared Key and the User account password correctly. This ensures secure communication over public networks.\n\n## Document_8\n\nDrop-in mode on Peplink devices only works with a single WAN connection. This means that for a deployment requiring drop-in mode, only one WAN connection can be utilized, which is relevant when dealing with limited IP address availability.\n\n## Document_9\n\nFor a network topology where a Peplink device is used in conjunction with an existing firewall, deploying the Peplink in drop-in mode is recommended. This allows the Peplink to handle NAT while the firewall manages filtering and VPN tunnels. Knowledge base articles from Peplink provide guidance on deploying the Peplink Balance in drop-in mode and its compatibility with existing firewalls.\n\n## Document_10\n\nDrop-in Mode allows Peplink and Pepwave products to be integrated into an existing network without requiring configuration changes to the current infrastructure. In this mode, the Peplink Balance forwards traffic between the LAN and WAN1 without performing IP address translation, ensuring that existing security policies remain effective. The firewall retains its original gateway settings, and if there is no spare IP address available on the WAN range, the Peplink can share an IP address while maintaining transparency. Additionally, when deployed in Drop-in mode, the PPTP server is automatically disabled, only one WAN port can be configured for Drop-in mode, and High Availability is disabled if the LAN Bypass port is selected as the WAN port.\n\n## Document_11\n\nDrop-in Mode allows Peplink and Pepwave products to be integrated into an existing network without requiring configuration changes to the current infrastructure. In this mode, the Peplink Balance router forwards traffic between the LAN and WAN1 without performing IP address translation, ensuring that existing security policies remain effective. The router can share a single static IP address if there are no spare IPs available on the WAN range. Additionally, when deployed in Drop-in Mode, the PPTP server is automatically disabled, only one WAN port can be configured for Drop-in Mode, and High Availability is disabled if the LAN Bypass port is used as the WAN port.\n\n## Document_12\n\nIn Drop-in Mode, Peplink | Pepwave products can be integrated into an existing network without requiring configuration changes to the current infrastructure. The Peplink Balance router forwards traffic between the LAN and WAN1 without altering IP addresses, allowing existing firewall security policies to remain effective. If there is no spare IP address available on the WAN range of the firewall, the Peplink can share an IP address while maintaining transparency. Additionally, when deployed in Drop-in mode, the PPTP server is automatically disabled, only one WAN port can be configured for Drop-in mode, and High Availability is disabled if the LAN Bypass port is used as the WAN port.\n\n## Document_13\n\nIn Drop-in Mode, Peplink | Pepwave products can be integrated into an existing network without requiring configuration changes to the current infrastructure. The Peplink Balance forwards traffic between the LAN and WAN without performing IP address translation, allowing existing security policies on the firewall to remain effective. When deployed, only one WAN port can be configured in Drop-in mode, and if there is no spare IP address on the WAN range of the firewall, the Peplink can share an IP to maintain transparency. Additionally, NAT mode is enabled by default for other WAN connections, facilitating proper routing of traffic. However, certain features like the PPTP server and High Availability are disabled when Drop-in mode is active or when specific ports are selected.\n\n## Document_14\n\nIn Drop-in Mode, Peplink and Pepwave products can be integrated into an existing network without requiring changes to the current infrastructure. The Peplink Balance router is installed between the ISP modem and the firewall, forwarding traffic between the LAN and WAN1 without performing IP address translation, thus maintaining existing security policies. The firewall retains its original gateway settings, and if there are no spare IP addresses in the WAN range, the Peplink can share an IP to ensure transparency. Other WAN connections operate in NAT mode by default. It is important to note that when deployed in Drop-in mode, the PPTP server is disabled, only one WAN port can be configured for Drop-in mode, and High Availability is disabled if the LAN Bypass port is used as the WAN port.\n\n## Document_15\n\nPeplink | Pepwave products can be deployed in Drop-in Mode, allowing integration into existing network infrastructures without requiring configuration changes. In this mode, the Peplink Balance forwards traffic between LAN and WAN without performing IP address translation, ensuring that existing security policies on the firewall remain effective. If there is no spare IP address available on the WAN range of the firewall, the Peplink can share the existing IP address, maintaining transparency. However, when deployed in Drop-in mode, certain features such as the PPTP server and High Availability are automatically disabled, and only one WAN port can be configured for Drop-in mode.\n\n## Document_16\n\nDrop-in Mode is a feature of Peplink devices that allows seamless integration into existing networks without requiring changes to the current configuration of other network appliances. In Drop-in Mode, the Peplink forwards traffic between the LAN and the WAN without performing IP address translation, maintaining the original firewall and NAT settings. This mode requires compatible Peplink Balance models and additional IPs from the ISP, as it consumes an IP to bridge to the LAN. Configuration can be done via the Setup Wizard or manually, where specific settings such as WAN Default Gateway and DNS servers must be entered. Notably, enabling Drop-in Mode disables several WAN features, including WAN Enable, Connection Method, and DHCP Server Settings, effectively turning the interface into a bridge.\n\n## Document_17\n\nDrop-in mode allows Peplink Balance and MAX routers to be integrated into existing networks without requiring changes to current network devices. This feature simplifies installation by enabling the Peplink router to work transparently with existing routers and firewalls. The Peplink router is connected to a computer for initial configuration before being inserted into the network. In drop-in mode, traffic is forwarded between the LAN and WAN ports of the Peplink without performing IP address translation, allowing the firewall to remain unaware of any changes. The configuration involves logging into the Peplink web admin interface, setting the LAN IP address, enabling drop-in mode, and configuring the default gateway and DNS servers. After configuration, the router may need to be rebooted to update routing tables, and network traffic should be verified before adding additional ISP connections for load balancing.\n\n## Document_18\n\nDrop-in mode on Peplink Balance routers allows for the integration of multiple internet connections into an existing network infrastructure without altering the current setup. In this mode, a Peplink router can be configured with an additional static IP while maintaining the existing firewall, such as a Sophos UTM, without any changes. The Peplink router can be set to prioritize traffic over its primary internet connection while using LTE as a backup. The configuration includes enabling LAN bypass, which ensures that if the Peplink router loses power, the primary internet connection remains active, thus preventing loss of connectivity. The demonstration illustrates how to set up the Peplink router in drop-in mode, including failover testing by disconnecting and reconnecting internet connections, showcasing the router's ability to reroute traffic seamlessly during outages.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe Peplink Balance can be set up in drop-in mode without requiring configuration changes on existing routers and firewalls. To begin, power on the Balance and connect a computer to one of its LAN ports, ensuring the computer is set to obtain an IP address automatically. Access the web admin interface via the default IP address 192.168.1.1, using 'admin' for both the username and password. In the interface, navigate to the network settings, assign an IP address (e.g., 10.10.10.3), and enable drop-in mode, which will overwrite some LAN settings. Configure WAN settings by adjusting upstream and downstream bandwidth to match actual connection speeds, inputting DNS server IP addresses, and enabling health check settings. After saving the settings, connect the Balance to the production network, rebooting routers and firewalls if necessary to update ARP tables. Verify network traffic routing before adding additional WAN connections, ensuring to save and apply all changes.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe device features eight antenna ports, including four for cellular modems, one for GPS, and two for Wi-Fi 6 connectivity, utilizing RP-SMA and SMA connectors. It supports dual 5G modems with a maximum download speed of 4 Gbps and upload speed of 700 Mbps, compatible with various cellular bands including T-Mobile's band 71 and AT&T's band 14. The device has four gigabit LAN ports and two 2.5 gigabit WAN ports, allowing for high-speed local area networking. It includes four SIM card slots and supports an external SIM injector for additional SIM management. The device can operate in drop-in mode for integration with existing firewalls, and it supports eSIM technology for remote data plan purchases. It is compatible with major US cellular carriers but may require certification for activation on some networks, such as Verizon. The device also features ignition sensing capabilities and a DB9 serial connector for machine-to-machine communication, enhancing its versatility in mobile applications.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo enable Bonjour Forwarding between VLANs on a Peplink Balance 20X, it is necessary to configure Bonjour Forwarding settings to allow communication from the untagged VLAN to VLAN 20 and vice versa. Additionally, enabling IGMP snooping may be required, especially when using managed switches, to facilitate multicast traffic. Despite these configurations, issues may still arise, as evidenced by difficulties in discovering AirPrint printers and AirPlay devices across VLANs.\n\n## Document_22\n\nThere is a confirmed bug affecting Bonjour Forwarding functionality on the Peplink Balance 20X router, which prevents proper communication between devices on untagged VLAN and VLAN 20. This issue has been acknowledged and reported for a fix.\n\n## Document_23\n\nIn a scenario where a Peplink Balance is deployed in Drop-in Mode alongside an existing firewall, outside users can access hosted servers behind the firewall by utilizing NAT from the Peplink to the firewall's outside IP address. For the PeVPN tunnel to facilitate access between the head office (HO) and branch office (BO), static routes must be configured in the Peplink Balance for the HO internal networks, directing traffic to the firewall's outside interface. Additionally, the firewall should have NAT exemption policies in place to prevent NAT for traffic originating from the internal networks to the branch office LAN and vice versa.\n\n## Document_24\n\nTo set up Peplink Balance VPNs for mobile smart devices using public unencrypted WiFi, it is recommended to use L2TP.

    "query": "What are the key challenges and workarounds for activating Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini LTE/ LTEA models on Verizon, and how do certification and IMEI recognition affect this process?",
    "answer": "Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini LTE/ LTEA models face several challenges when activating on Verizon. Certification is a major factor: The MAX-BR1-MINI-LTEA-W-T is now certified for Verizon, but not all models are, and certification status directly affects activation success. IMEI recognition is another key issue; Verizon's system may not recognize the IMEI of these devices, even if they are certified. To work around IMEI recognition problems, users sometimes activate a SIM in a Verizon Jetpack or other recognized device, then move the SIM to the Pepwave unit. In some cases, using a 14-digit IMEI (excluding the last digit) or entering an official IMEI during activation can help bypass carrier restrictions. Additionally, Verizon may require GPS compatibility for activation, which some MAX BR1 Mini models lack, leading to further issues. Even with a certified model, data plan compatibility must be confirmed, as not all plans work with commercial routers. If activation fails, contacting Verizon support directly and providing all necessary device and plan details is recommended.",

    "query": "How should a technician ensure reliable power supply to the Pepwave MAX Transit Duo and MAX Transit CAT 18 when using USB power, especially under high load or when using dual SIMs or tunnels?",
    "answer": "For the Pepwave MAX Transit Duo, reliable operation on USB power requires a high current supply of 2.4A. If only lower current USB supplies are available, both USB connectors must be used to meet the device’s power needs. If the device is under high load (e.g., using two SIM cards and creating a tunnel), insufficient voltage or a faulty USB cable may cause power issues, such as the battery light flashing red every 10 seconds. The MAX Transit CAT 18 has two USB power input ports, each rated at 5V 2A (totaling 10W), but its power consumption is 18W, so both ports must be powered simultaneously with separate sources to provide adequate power and enable battery cycling without downtime. Failing to meet these requirements can result in unreliable operation or the device failing to power up properly.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_2\n\nFor high availability (HA) configurations with Peplink Balance 710 devices, using an active/active setup is recommended over an active/passive VRRP HA-pair due to the slow failover times associated with VRRP, which can exceed 30 seconds. In cases where compliance requires an active/passive configuration, VRRP may still be used, but it is considered cumbersome and outdated compared to active/active configurations that allow for faster failover and better resource utilization.\n\n## Document_3\n\nIn a high availability (HA) setup using Peplink Balance routers in NAT mode, VRRP is utilized for WAN as well as LAN configurations. When properly configured, VRRP allows for the transfer of WAN addresses from the master router to the slave router in the event of a failure. This means that only one public IP address is needed for the HA setup, as the slave router will take over the master router's public IP address upon failure, rather than requiring multiple public IP addresses for each router.\n\n## Document_4\n\nIn a high availability (HA) setup for Peplink Balance routers in NAT mode, the LAN configuration requires a Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) setup with a virtual IP (VIP) for the master and slave units. For the WAN configuration, two options are presented. Option 1 requires three VRRP groups: one for the LAN and one for each ISP, necessitating a total of six public IP addresses. Option 2 suggests a simpler configuration with only two public IP addresses, where the master unit handles both WAN connections and the slave unit takes over the WAN IP address upon failover. The WAN setup involves two ISPs, each with its own subnet and gateway.\n\n## Document_5\n\nIn a High Availability (HA) setup using two Peplink Balance 380 routers configured with VRRP, issues may arise when both routers compete for the master role, particularly during internet connectivity loss. This can lead to network downtime as the routers transition between master and slave roles. The VRRP protocol relies on periodic advertisement packets sent from the master device to maintain the master-slave relationship. If both routers remain connected to the LAN and are aware of each other's WAN connectivity, conflicts over the master role can occur, especially if one router fails to recognize the recovery of the other after a power cycle. Proper diagnostics and physical connection details are crucial for troubleshooting these issues effectively.\n\n## Document_6\n\nPepwave routers support high availability configurations using the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) as defined in RFC 3768, allowing for redundancy and failover in a master-slave arrangement. In this configuration, two Pepwave routers communicate over the LAN using VRRP, broadcasting heartbeat signals at a frequency of one per second. If the master router fails to send a heartbeat signal for 3 seconds or longer, the slave router activates, initiates WAN connections, and binds to a preconfigured LAN IP address. Upon recovery, the master router will regain its active status by default.\n\n## Document_7\n\nPeplink Balance devices, specifically the Balance 210 or above and MAX 700/HD, support High Availability (HA) failover using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP).

In this setup, one router (the master) handles all connectivity, while the other (the slave) remains on standby. If the master router experiences a failure, the slave router automatically takes over within approximately 15 seconds, ensuring continuous internet connectivity. The demonstration involved two Peplink Balance 380 routers, with an active ping to Google's public DNS to monitor connectivity. When the master router was turned off, the pings stopped, but once the slave router assumed master status, the pings resumed, demonstrating the effectiveness of the high availability setup. The process also includes the ability for the master router to regain control once it is powered back on, reverting the roles of the routers accordingly.\n\n## Document_15\n\nHigh Availability (HA) mode, also known as HA mode, provides hardware redundancy by allowing a slave unit to take over the role of a master unit in the event of a failure. This failover mechanism is based on the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), which sends a heartbeat signal from the master device to the slave device. If the heartbeat is lost due to hardware failure or disconnection, the slave unit assumes the master role. The setup involves configuring two Peplink Balance 20X devices, where the master device is set up first by enabling HA mode, selecting the master role, and configuring a virtual IP address that serves as the default gateway for connected hosts. The slave device is then configured to sync its settings with the master either automatically or manually, ensuring it has a different LAN IP address. The failover process typically takes 10 to 15 seconds, during which all line connections are re-established. Successful configuration can be verified through the web admin dashboard of the slave device, which will indicate that HA mode is enabled.\n\n## Document_16\n\nWhen using a pair of Balance 710s as a high availability (HA) pair, the failover process can result in significant downtime due to the lack of real session synchronization, with outages exceeding 30 seconds. An alternative approach is to configure two independent Balance 710s and connect each branch office to both devices, which may require more configuration work but can lead to faster failover. The use of OSPF routes and path costs can also influence the failover time and network performance.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe Peplink Max HD4 can function as a backup router in a VRRP configuration alongside two other routers, where it can serve as the third backup router.

    "query": "How does enabling AES-256 encryption and bonding on Peplink devices (such as the Balance 380 and MAX HD4) affect performance and compliance, and what are the relevant FIPS 140-2 considerations?",
    "answer": "Enabling AES-256 encryption on Peplink devices like the Balance 380 and MAX HD4 provides strong security and is integrated into SpeedFusion VPN by default. However, when bonding is also enabled, there can be a significant increase in latency (e.g., from 70–80ms up to 200–220ms) and a reduction in throughput. Disabling AES-256 encryption can approximately double SpeedFusion throughput. For compliance, Peplink Balance devices (including models 1350 and 310) have obtained FIPS 140-2 certification with the CoCo Cryptographic Module by UNIUM, but PEPVPN AES-256 currently does not support FIPS PUB 140-2. SpeedFusion encryption settings are simplified compared to IPsec, as specific IPsec parameters do not apply. Thus, while AES-256 encryption and bonding enhance security and connectivity, they can impact performance, and FIPS 140-2 compliance depends on the device, firmware, and VPN protocol used.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_2\n\nTo address the issue of a Peplink 580 rebooting every 60-70 days, it is recommended to update the firmware from the current version 7.1.1 to version 8.1.2 to resolve potential issues related to outdated firmware. If the problem persists after the update, it is advised to open a support ticket for further assistance.\n\n## Document_3\n\nFor maintenance of Peplink Balance devices, it is recommended to perform an annual review to ensure that the devices are running the latest firmware with security fixes. While Peplink devices can run for extended periods without rebooting, setting an overnight reboot can be beneficial to force a DHCP renewal on the cellular modem during off-peak hours, minimizing user impact.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe MediaFast 500 supports all 8 load balancing algorithms, contrary to the initial impression that it only supports 7. This indicates that the specifications for the MediaFast family may not be fully representative of its capabilities regarding load balancing algorithms.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe Peplink Balance SDX is expected to handle 1Gbps NAT throughput with firewall rules enabled, as its rated throughput is based on stateful firewall throughput with NAT. In contrast, the older Balance 580 has a maximum router/firewall throughput of 400Mbps, which is insufficient for handling 1Gbps WAN connections.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe NAT throughput of the Peplink Balance SDX is not explicitly stated in terms of real-world performance with firewall rules enabled. The datasheet indicates a router throughput of 12Gbps, but the actual NAT throughput may vary based on the configuration and rules applied. Users migrating from older models like the Balance 580, which has a NAT throughput of approximately 500Mbps, may seek to achieve closer to 1Gbps with the SDX under similar conditions. For configuration management, InControl2 can be used to import and edit firewall rules across multiple devices, and Peplink support can assist in converting configuration files from older models to the new SDX.\n\n## Document_7\n\nWhen using a Peplink Balance E20 with two leased lines of 2 Mbps each for 30 systems and 20 VoIP phones, users may experience voice breakage issues even when internet connectivity appears stable. The Balance E20 is recommended for up to 25 concurrent users, and having 50 total devices may exceed its capacity, potentially leading to performance issues.\n\n## Document_8\n\nTo create a VPN connection between two Peplink units, specifically the BPL 305 and BPL 310, users can refer to the Balance and MediaFast User Manual for Firmware 7, which is available for download on the Peplink website under the Support section.\n\n## Document_9\n\nTo increase bandwidth at a site with a 512k down / 128k up frame relay connection, a Peplink Balance unit can be utilized for inbound and outbound load balancing. The specific model needed may depend on the number of users and applications in the network, with options like the Balance 30 and Balance 310 available for consideration based on cost-effectiveness and network requirements.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThere is a configuration migration tool available for migrating settings between the Peplink Balance 30L and Balance 20 models, but it is not publicly accessible and can be obtained through Peplink support.\n\n## Document_11\n\nIn a network configuration involving PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is noted that IP Sec tunnels do not typically advertise their routes through second hops. To enable connectivity from satellite sites to Azure, a static route for the Azure subnet can be added on the satellite devices, pointing to the Balance 508. Additionally, firewall configurations on both the satellite sites and Azure may need to be reviewed to ensure they allow the necessary traffic exchange.\n\n## Document_12\n\nIn a network configuration involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 routers connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is important to ensure that outbound rules are correctly set up for traffic to traverse from the satellite sites to Azure. The Balance 508 needs to properly advertise its routes to the connected 305 devices for successful end-to-end connectivity.\n\n## Document_13\n\nTo enhance security on Peplink Balance one routers, it is recommended to change the default inbound firewall rule to deny all. If there is a need for specific inbound access, allow rules can be created above the default deny rule.\n\n## Document_14\n\nWhen setting up multiple WAN links in a Peplink balancer, it is common to observe different WAN link paths to the same destination due to the dynamic nature of internet routing. Routes can change frequently as routers adjust their paths, which can be illustrated by performing a traceroute. Peplink may utilize mechanisms such as round-robin for load balancing across these WAN links, but the variability in routing is a general characteristic of the internet.\n\n## Document_15\n\nIn a drop-in mode deployment of the PepLink Balance 380, the DHCP Server settings will be overwritten. Typically, a firewall with public IPs is positioned on the inside of the Balance, and DHCP is managed on the inside of the firewall.\n\n## Document_16\n\nIn a network setup involving a PepLink Balance One, if an ISP's modem is seeing internal LAN IP addresses, it is important to check the Routing Mode for WAN1. The mode should be set to NAT (Network Address Translation) rather than IP-Forwarding to ensure that only the PepLink's IP address is visible to the ISP's modem, concealing the internal LAN IP addresses from being exposed.\n\n## Document_17\n\nIt is not possible to convert the configuration from a PepLink Balance 310 to a PepLink Balance 210. Additionally, it is important to confirm whether a 3rd WAN activation license has been purchased for the Balance 210 router.\n\n## Document_18\n\nFor load balancing with different WAN technologies such as DSL, Fiber, and Vsat, with a throughput requirement of more than 2GB, the Peplink BPL-710 or BPL-1350 Max models are suitable options. These models support NAT for all WAN ports and can reroute traffic from a congested or failed link to other WAN links with different NAT configurations. However, specific information regarding failover for WAN links and NAT resolution for users when one of the WAN links goes down is not provided.\n\n## Document_19\n\nTo achieve bandwidth bonding for multiple ADSL WAN connections, SpeedFusion technology is necessary, which requires two SpeedFusion capable devices to establish a VPN tunnel. This setup allows traffic to be split across all available WAN connections, with packets being re-ordered and sent out through the internet from the other end of the tunnel. The basic version of SpeedFusion supports connections to up to five remote locations. Additionally, SpeedFusion can be installed on various virtual machine platforms, including Amazon Web Services, VMware, Citrix XenServer, Oracle VirtualBox, and Microsoft Hyper-V, depending on network requirements.\n\n## Document_20\n\nFor load balancing and failover of two 15Mb DSL connections with 15 users and 50 devices including VoIP and VPN support, the PepLink Balance 030 may not be adequate as it is recommended for up to 25 simultaneous users/devices. The Balance One is suggested as a more suitable option for this configuration.\n\n## Document_21\n\nThe Peplink Balance 380 is rated for up to 500 concurrent users, making it a more powerful device compared to the Balance One, which supports up to 50 concurrent users. Despite being an older model, the 380 has significantly higher data capacity and processing power than the Balance One.\n\n## Document_22\n\nPeplink lists several USB modems compatible with their Balance Routers, including the AT&T USBConnect Momentum 4G, which supports 4G LTE and 3G. However, this device is no longer available. Other listed devices include various models from Sierra Wireless and LG, but they may not be current AT&T products. The user is specifically looking for a USB modem with 3G fallback capability, indicating a preference for devices that are not mobile hotspots.\n\n## Document_23\n\nTo issue public IPs to clients using a Peplink router, it is important to configure the router to allow the billing gateway to handle 1:1 NAT. If the internet fails on WAN1, the public IPs on the LAN will NAT to the public IPs on WAN2. However, IP forwarding cannot be used on more than one WAN with public IPs. Load balancing and failover can be managed through outbound policy rules in the Peplink Balance router.\n\n## Document_24\n\nWhen considering a Peplink Balance router for a network of about 80 users, the Balance One is rated for 1Gbps throughput but recommended for only up to 50 users. The Balance 305 is the least expensive model rated for the required number of users, with a throughput of 200Mbps, which is close to the current 150Mbps internet connection. Key factors for sizing include the number of WAN links, available WAN bandwidth, SpeedFusion VPN usage, and the type of traffic over SpeedFusion. The Balance One can handle a high number of concurrent sessions, tested up to 5000, but lacks some enterprise features found in higher models like the Balance 305 and 380, which include hardware high availability support, advanced AP controller functionality, and QoS user groups.\n\n## Document_25\n\nThe Peplink Balance One router, with a throughput of 1Gbps, is recommended for smaller environments (1-50 users) due to its ability to handle fewer concurrent sessions compared to larger models like the Peplink 305, which is designed for 50-500 users and has a throughput of 200Mbps. The Balance One is suitable for smaller branches or remote power users with high-speed internet connections, while larger units are intended for enterprise offices that require support for more concurrent users and sessions.\n\n## Document_26\n\nIncontrol and InControl2 are distinct platforms, and there is currently no automated method for migrating devices from Incontrol to InControl2; the migration process must be performed manually.\n\n## Document_27\n\nThe Peplink B One series supports a 1 Gbps throughput and is suitable for small businesses, but certain features like RADIUS and LDAP authentication for VPN are only available in higher-end models such as the Balance 210 and above. Users have reported issues with the accuracy of product specifications, as features listed in manuals and datasheets may not be available in the actual devices. The Balance 310 5G Fiber model is recommended for normal business use due to its ability to handle a full 1 Gbps fiber connection with all features enabled. Users have experienced stability issues with firmware versions, particularly with the Balance 310, which requires specific firmware to avoid frequent lockups. Additionally, using AWS EC2 for hosting FusionHub is suggested as a better alternative to Vultr due to networking issues.\n\n## Document_28\n\nFor load balancing needs with support for up to 10gbps throughput, the Peplink SDX is recommended as it can handle high bandwidth levels and offers a flex port for 5G modems or additional SFP ports. The Peplink Balance 580X is also a viable option, featuring a flexi port for SFP, but is similarly priced to the SDX, making the SDX a more advantageous choice.\n\n## Document_29\n\nThe Balance MediaFast family of products supports 7 load balancing algorithms, while the BALANCE family supports 8. The missing algorithm is likely 'fastest response time', which was added most recently. However, it is also possible that the MediaFast reference and datasheets are outdated.\n\n## Document_30\n\nTo create a VPN connection between two Peplink units, such as the BPL 305 and BPL 310, it is important to refer to the user manual for detailed instructions. Additionally, if there is a router or firewall in front of the Peplink devices, port forwarding must be configured for the default protocols TCP 32015 and UDP 4500 to ensure proper connectivity.\n\n## Document_31\n\nTo enable connectivity from PepLink Balance 305 devices to Azure through a Balance 508, static routes can be configured on the Balance 305 for the Azure subnet, using the Balance 508 as the gateway. Additionally, the Azure configuration should include a static route for the Balance 305 subnet, also using the Balance 508 as the gateway. It is important to ensure that firewall rules on both ends permit this routing to function correctly.\n\n## Document_32\n\nIn a network setup involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via a star topology, issues may arise with route advertisement to Azure through IP Sec VPN tunnels. The Balance 508 may not be advertising its routes to the connected Balance 305 devices, which can prevent satellite sites from accessing Azure. Additionally, static routes may need to connect to gateways within the same subnet, which can complicate configurations if sites are not willing to share a common subnet.\n\n## Document_33\n\nThe outbound policy configuration on the PepLink Balance 508 was successfully adjusted, allowing the connected Balance 305 devices to traverse to Azure through the established IP Sec VPN tunnels. This indicates that proper routing and policy settings are essential for enabling connectivity between satellite sites and Azure.\n\n## Document_34\n\nTo enhance security on Peplink Balance One routers, it is essential to define firewall rules based on the specific applications in use and their required ports. Common ports for email applications include SMTP, SMTPS, POP, POPS, and IMAPS. It is recommended to obtain information from application vendors to ensure that the appropriate service ports are allowed in the firewall configuration.\n\n## Document_35\n\nTo enhance security on Peplink Balance routers, it is essential to understand the services used in the specific environment before configuring firewall rules. Only the necessary ports should be opened in the Inbound and Outbound firewall rules based on the services being utilized, rather than relying on generic lists of ports.\n\n## Document_36\n\nFor increasing security on Peplink Balance routers, it is recommended to refer to the Peplink Knowledgebase for detailed guidance on configuring firewall rules. The Knowledgebase contains more in-depth information than the manual, including proper setup for firewall rules.\n\n## Document_37\n\nTo enhance security on Peplink Balance routers, users should define three types of firewall rules: Outbound Firewall Rules, Inbound Firewall Rules, and Internal Network Firewall Rules. Outbound rules control LAN users' access to the internet, while inbound rules apply to specific traffic types such as WAN 1 traffic in drop-in mode and defined inbound services. Internal network rules manage traffic between LAN, VLAN, and other networks. Users can refer to the product user manual for detailed guidance on setting these rules and should understand the required service ports for applications to configure the rules effectively. Default ports for web traffic include DNS (UDP 53), HTTP (TCP 80), and HTTPS (TCP 443), while specific email services like Gmail and Office 365 have their own required ports.\n\n## Document_38\n\nTo increase security on Peplink Balance routers, it is important to set up firewall rules tailored to specific needs, as there is no universal list of rules applicable to all users. For example, to allow outbound VoIP traffic, a rule can be created that permits traffic from any IP address on the network to port 5060 with a specific destination address. It is essential to consult the documentation of the VoIP provider to determine the necessary ports and protocols for configuration.\n\n## Document_39\n\nTo enhance security on Peplink Balance One routers, a set of firewall rules can be implemented. These include outbound rules such as country blocking, preventing multicast and UPNP traffic, and allowing only specific VLANs and untagged LAN access to WAN while blocking all other networks. Inbound rules should also include country blocking, allowing specific access for gaming devices, and a default allow rule to manage inbound traffic. Internal network rules can facilitate specific access between VLANs while blocking all other inter-VLAN routing by default. Additionally, local firewall rules should block all access from WAN to local service ports.\n\n## Document_40\n\nTo enhance security on Peplink Balance routers, it is suggested to implement a general 'mDNS allow' rule in the internal network firewall settings, which facilitates the operation of Apple HomeKit devices. Additionally, adjustments to the access point configuration for the corresponding VLAN may be necessary, such as disabling 'Guest Protect' and the 'Block All Private IP' setting to allow HomeKit devices to communicate. Inter-VLAN routing should also be enabled for the relevant VLAN to ensure proper connectivity between devices.\n\n## Document_41\n\nTo enhance security on Peplink Balance One routers, enabling Peplink Bonjour Forwarding allows for the automatic handling of specific ports without the need for separate firewall rules for Bonjour, UPnP, and mDNS traffic. However, attempts to restrict traffic between VLANs for Apple products using specific ports were found to be ineffective due to the variety of ports used by Apple services. Instead, a more effective approach is to create a single firewall rule that permits any communication between defined groups of devices across VLANs, ensuring necessary interactions while maintaining a level of control.\n\n## Document_42\n\nThe ISP's modem is observing internal LAN IP addresses and performing ARP requests for devices on the network, which is unexpected behavior for a router performing NAT/DHCP. Typically, the ISP's modem should only see the public IP address of the PepLink Balance One router and its MAC address. However, the modem is issuing ARP commands for specific internal IP addresses and occasionally adding or deleting routes for these addresses, indicating that the internal devices are somehow visible to the ISP's modem despite NAT being in place.\n\n",

      "In a network configuration involving PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is noted that IP Sec tunnels do not typically advertise their routes through second hops. To enable connectivity from satellite sites to Azure, a static route for the Azure subnet can be added on the satellite devices, pointing to the Balance 508. Additionally, firewall configurations on both the satellite sites and Azure may need to be reviewed to ensure they allow the necessary traffic exchange.",
      "In a network configuration involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 routers connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is important to ensure that outbound rules are correctly set up for traffic to traverse from the satellite sites to Azure. The Balance 508 needs to properly advertise its routes to the connected 305 devices for successful end-to-end connectivity.",
      "To enhance security on Peplink Balance one routers, it is recommended to change the default inbound firewall rule to deny all. If there is a need for specific inbound access, allow rules can be created above the default deny rule.",
      "When setting up multiple WAN links in a Peplink balancer, it is common to observe different WAN link paths to the same destination due to the dynamic nature of internet routing. Routes can change frequently as routers adjust their paths, which can be illustrated by performing a traceroute. Peplink may utilize mechanisms such as round-robin for load balancing across these WAN links, but the variability in routing is a general characteristic of the internet.",
      "In a drop-in mode deployment of the PepLink Balance 380, the DHCP Server settings will be overwritten. Typically, a firewall with public IPs is positioned on the inside of the Balance, and DHCP is managed on the inside of the firewall.",
      "In a network setup involving a PepLink Balance One, if an ISP's modem is seeing internal LAN IP addresses, it is important to check the Routing Mode for WAN1. The mode should be set to NAT (Network Address Translation) rather than IP-Forwarding to ensure that only the PepLink's IP address is visible to the ISP's modem, concealing the internal LAN IP addresses from being exposed.",
      "It is not possible to convert the configuration from a PepLink Balance 310 to a PepLink Balance 210. Additionally, it is important to confirm whether a 3rd WAN activation license has been purchased for the Balance 210 router.",
      "For load balancing with different WAN technologies such as DSL, Fiber, and Vsat, with a throughput requirement of more than 2GB, the Peplink BPL-710 or BPL-1350 Max models are suitable options. These models support NAT for all WAN ports and can reroute traffic from a congested or failed link to other WAN links with different NAT configurations. However, specific information regarding failover for WAN links and NAT resolution for users when one of the WAN links goes down is not provided.",
      "To achieve bandwidth bonding for multiple ADSL WAN connections, SpeedFusion technology is necessary, which requires two SpeedFusion capable devices to establish a VPN tunnel. This setup allows traffic to be split across all available WAN connections, with packets being re-ordered and sent out through the internet from the other end of the tunnel. The basic version of SpeedFusion supports connections to up to five remote locations. Additionally, SpeedFusion can be installed on various virtual machine platforms, including Amazon Web Services, VMware, Citrix XenServer, Oracle VirtualBox, and Microsoft Hyper-V, depending on network requirements.",
      "For load balancing and failover of two 15Mb DSL connections with 15 users and 50 devices including VoIP and VPN support, the PepLink Balance 030 may not be adequate as it is recommended for up to 25 simultaneous users/devices. The Balance One is suggested as a more suitable option for this configuration.",
      "The Peplink Balance 380 is rated for up to 500 concurrent users, making it a more powerful device compared to the Balance One, which supports up to 50 concurrent users. Despite being an older model, the 380 has significantly higher data capacity and processing power than the Balance One.",
      "Peplink lists several USB modems compatible with their Balance Routers, including the AT&T USBConnect Momentum 4G, which supports 4G LTE and 3G. However, this device is no longer available. Other listed devices include various models from Sierra Wireless and LG, but they may not be current AT&T products. The user is specifically looking for a USB modem with 3G fallback capability, indicating a preference for devices that are not mobile hotspots.",
      "To issue public IPs to clients using a Peplink router, it is important to configure the router to allow the billing gateway to handle 1:1 NAT. If the internet fails on WAN1, the public IPs on the LAN will NAT to the public IPs on WAN2. However, IP forwarding cannot be used on more than one WAN with public IPs. Load balancing and failover can be managed through outbound policy rules in the Peplink Balance router.",
      "When considering a Peplink Balance router for a network of about 80 users, the Balance One is rated for 1Gbps throughput but recommended for only up to 50 users. The Balance 305 is the least expensive model rated for the required number of users, with a throughput of 200Mbps, which is close to the current 150Mbps internet connection. Key factors for sizing include the number of WAN links, available WAN bandwidth, SpeedFusion VPN usage, and the type of traffic over SpeedFusion. The Balance One can handle a high number of concurrent sessions, tested up to 5000, but lacks some enterprise features found in higher models like the Balance 305 and 380, which include hardware high availability support, advanced AP controller functionality, and QoS user groups.",
      "The Peplink Balance One router, with a throughput of 1Gbps, is recommended for smaller environments (1-50 users) due to its ability to handle fewer concurrent sessions compared to larger models like the Peplink 305, which is designed for 50-500 users and has a throughput of 200Mbps. The Balance One is suitable for smaller branches or remote power users with high-speed internet connections, while larger units are intended for enterprise offices that require support for more concurrent users and sessions.",
      "Incontrol and InControl2 are distinct platforms, and there is currently no automated method for migrating devices from Incontrol to InControl2; the migration process must be performed manually.",
      "The Peplink B One series supports a 1 Gbps throughput and is suitable for small businesses, but certain features like RADIUS and LDAP authentication for VPN are only available in higher-end models such as the Balance 210 and above. Users have reported issues with the accuracy of product specifications, as features listed in manuals and datasheets may not be available in the actual devices. The Balance 310 5G Fiber model is recommended for normal business use due to its ability to handle a full 1 Gbps fiber connection with all features enabled. Users have experienced stability issues with firmware versions, particularly with the Balance 310, which requires specific firmware to avoid frequent lockups. Additionally, using AWS EC2 for hosting FusionHub is suggested as a better alternative to Vultr due to networking issues.",
      "For load balancing needs with support for up to 10gbps throughput, the Peplink SDX is recommended as it can handle high bandwidth levels and offers a flex port for 5G modems or additional SFP ports. The Peplink Balance 580X is also a viable option, featuring a flexi port for SFP, but is similarly priced to the SDX, making the SDX a more advantageous choice.",

    "query": "How does InControl 2 enable centralized management of Wi-Fi and VLANs across multiple Peplink devices, and what are the implications for device configuration and security?",
    "answer": "InControl 2 provides a centralized platform for managing Peplink devices, allowing administrators to configure Wi-Fi settings and VLAN networks across multiple devices from a single web interface. When Wi-Fi Management is enabled, group-level Wi-Fi settings are pushed to all registered devices, which may overwrite existing SSIDs on those devices to ensure consistency. Similarly, VLAN configurations set in InControl 2 are distributed to selected devices based on predefined or custom tags, standardizing network segmentation across the deployment. The platform supports a multi-tiered organizational structure, enabling management at the organization, group, and device levels. InControl 2 enhances security by requiring two-factor authentication for all managed customers, and administrators can set idle timeouts and manage user access at various levels. If remote management is not required, it is recommended to register the device with InControl 2 to secure ownership and then disable InControl 2 Management on the device for added security. In summary, InControl 2 streamlines network management, enforces configuration uniformity, and incorporates robust security practices.",

This indicates a potential compatibility issue with the firmware version 8.1.0 regarding SIM detection.\n\n## Document_9\n\nAfter a router's warranty period, users can purchase an InControl2 (IC2) subscription for models like the Balance 20 and Surf SOHO, which provides access to IC2 but does not cover hardware warranty. An extended warranty can also be purchased for those who want both IC2 access and hardware coverage. The subscription is a more affordable option for IC2 manageability alone.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo regain web-based control of devices through InControl2 after the warranty period has expired, one can purchase an InControl subscription for 12 or 24 months (SKU: ICS-012, ICS-024). This subscription is applicable to various models including Balance 20, 30, 50, One, One Core, MAX On-The-Go, BR, Surf SOHO, AP One AC Mini, 300M, In-Wall, Flex, AP Pro, and FusionHub Essential and Pro. Devices that are out of warranty require an Extended Warranty, which is also available for 12 or 24 months. Additionally, SmartCare can be obtained to restore warranty status for out-of-warranty devices, potentially requiring a current diagnostic file.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Peplink Balance One (14D3) is experiencing intermittent loss of access to the LAN port (192.168.1.1) and is showing as offline in INControl2, despite the status LED and Wi-Fi indicators remaining green. Power cycling the device temporarily restores functionality for varying durations. Troubleshooting steps taken include changing the MTU settings to auto from 1440, upgrading firmware from 7.01 to 7.02, modifying the LAN IP address, and blocking all inbound connections. No new configurations were made prior to the issue arising, and the device is still under warranty until 2019.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTotalCare is a support policy offered by Peplink that is only available in North America.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe InControl2 (IC2) subscription is applicable only for specific Peplink products, including Balance models 20, 30, 50, One, One Core, MAX On-The-Go, BR, Surf SOHO, AP One AC Mini, 300M, In-Wall, Flex, AP Pro, and FusionHub Essential and Pro. For a Balance 710 with an expired warranty, it is recommended to purchase TotalCare or SmartCare instead.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo connect a client's Peplink devices to the InControl 2 (IC2) web portal, all devices must be under warranty or have an IC2 subscription, which is only available for smaller models. Devices such as the Balance 210 and above need to be put back into warranty to utilize IC2. Additionally, all devices must be running firmware version 6.x or higher to be recognized by IC2.\n\n## Document_15\n\nTo resolve the issue of the missing 'Remote Sim Management' menu in the HD2 Dome and Remote SIM Injector, it is necessary to update the firmware of both devices. The recommended firmware for the HD2 Dome is version 8.0.1s015, and for the Remote SIM Injector, it is version 1.1.8. After updating, further updates to the HD2 Dome can be made to version 8.0.1 RC4 if needed. If problems persist after these updates, users should contact Peplink support or their local reseller for assistance.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe InControl 2 (IC2) subscription is not available for the Pepwave MAX HD2 devices. Instead, users need to purchase either a standard or smart care warranty for these devices. A list of devices eligible for IC2 subscription includes various models from the Balance series, MAX On-The-Go, Surf SOHO, AP One series, and FusionHub options.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo broadcast TV from the field without satellite, a Balance router can be used to establish SpeedFusion connections between multiple MAX routers, depending on the model. For instance, a Balance 210 supports connections from 2 SpeedFusion peers, allowing for remote locations to connect. Utilizing SpeedFusion technology can enhance the broadcasting setup, and deployment diagrams are available to illustrate the configuration for effective broadcasting.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Surf SOHO is listed as a legacy product on the Peplink website, indicating that Peplink is likely not producing any more units of this model, and once the current inventory is sold out, it may no longer be available.\n\n## Document_19\n\nPeplink routers come with a one-year Hardware Warranty and one year of InControl 2 Access, which can be extended or added through TotalCare, Extended Warranty, or InControl 2 Subscription options. TotalCare is a premium service available for enterprise-grade models, offering hardware warranty, InControl 2 access, telephone support, 24x7 email support, and advance hardware replacement. The Extended Warranty is available for all models and includes hardware warranty and InControl 2 access. The InControl 2 Subscription provides access for one or two years but is limited to certain models.\n\n## Document_20\n\nA proposed design for a mounting sleeve for the HD Dome includes an M35 Female thread on one end to cover the M35 thread of the Dome and a 1\"x 14 standard Female thread on the other end to fit onto a 1\"x 14 standard male maritime fitting. The material suggested for the mount is 316 stainless steel, and there is a consideration for a cable exit opening versus having cables go through the base. A design for a two-piece stainless mount has been created to prevent cable twisting during installation, although the manufacturing cost is noted to be high.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo obtain a subscription for the MAX HD2 device, one should purchase EssentialCare instead of the InControl2 subscription, as Peplink does not sell IC2 subscriptions solely for the HD2. EssentialCare can be acquired through a Peplink partner.\n\n## Document_22\n\nTo use InControl2 Management for Peplink devices, the device must have an active warranty or an InControl2 subscription. Users can register for an account at the InControl2 website to access its features. If the warranty or subscription expires, the device will show as offline in InControl2, but service will resume once the subscription or warranty is renewed.\n\n## Document_23\n\nTo renew InControl2 or warranty for a SpeedFusion Engine CAM, it is recommended to submit a support ticket and provide the device's serial number. Essential Care is available for the SpeedFusion Engine CAM.\n\n## Document_24\n\nWhen the warranty for a Peplink device expires, the associated InControl 2 subscription also expires, causing the device to be deemed offline as it no longer reports to the InControl 2 cloud. To maintain access to InControl 2, a SmartCare license must be purchased to reactivate the warranty, which includes a new InControl 2 subscription. Alternatively, for some Peplink/Pepwave products, it is possible to purchase a standalone InControl 2 license at a lower cost than SmartCare.\n\n## Document_25\n\nThe Max Transit Dual SIM model Max-tst-glte-g-t-prm includes a GPS antenna and is available for sale at $200 shipped. It is suitable for users looking for a device that supports dual SIM functionality and may require licenses for Fusion Solo and InControl2, along with optional Primecare or Essential Care support.\n\n## Document_26\n\nThe video discusses troubleshooting techniques for Pepwave routers, focusing on hardware features and tools for optimizing network performance.

    "answer": "When a Pepwave SOHO MK3 fails to update from firmware 8.0.2 to 8.1.0, several troubleshooting steps and considerations should be followed. First, download and back up the current configuration, then perform a factory reset. After resetting, log in, change the password if necessary, and attempt the firmware upgrade again, either manually or through the web interface. If the upgrade is successful, restore the configuration. It has been observed that attempting this process while the device is managed via InControl can cause the update to fail, so disconnecting from InControl may improve the chances of a successful upgrade. If the device continues to display the old firmware version or reports errors such as 'not bootable,' it may be necessary to request a special firmware version from support.

Currently, the device is not booting, and a console log accessed via a serial cable at a baud rate of 115200 indicates potential corruption of the compact flash memory. The console connection is unreliable, often failing to establish a connection.\n\n## Document_11\n\nWhen experiencing a boot issue with a Peplink 1350, where the device displays only lines on the screen, it may indicate a problem with the boot loader or corrupted operating system. In such cases, there may be an option to replace the compact flash memory if it is determined that the OS is corrupt. However, commands to upload new firmware via SSH or console may not be readily available, complicating the recovery process.\n\n## Document_12\n\nIf a Peplink 1350 displays only lines on the screen during startup and does not allow login, it may indicate a hardware issue if the device fails to boot after being rebooted. In such cases, it is recommended to open a support ticket for further investigation.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe error message indicating that WAN1 and WAN2 are disconnected due to 'no cable detected' could be attributed to several factors. It is important to first check the stability of the WAN connections and then inspect the cabling for any issues. If the cabling is confirmed to be fine, there may be a problem with the WAN port negotiation speeds.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo reduce the brightness of the blue LED lights on a Peplink device while watching TV, a scheduled task can be added to turn off the LED lights during the night or evening hours.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Firmware Archive for Peplink products, including the Surf SOHO hardware generation 2, can be accessed through the provided link. This archive contains various firmware versions for users who may need to downgrade their firmware.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo implement rolling updates for access points in IC2, users should select the update schedule option and change it from 'immediately' to 'scheduled'.

A dotted line on the map signifies that the device was losing GPS signal.\n\n## Document_18\n\nTo add users in InControl2, once a person is added, they will receive an email with a unique link. If the email is not received, the user can go to the InControl2 login page and select the 'Reset' option next to 'Forgot your password?' to receive a password reset email by entering their email address and clicking the Send button.\n\n## Document_19\n\nTo unregister a router from an InControl2 account, one should remove the device from its current group within the existing organization. After this, the router can be added to a new organization or account.\n\n## Document_20\n\nTo move a device from one group to another within InControl, navigate to the Group Dashboard page, click on Manage, select the device by ticking the corresponding box, and then use the Actions pull-down menu to select Move.\n\n## Document_21\n\nInControl2 appliance is available for private hosting, which can help manage devices that are in a VPN cloud and do not have direct internet access. This solution may assist in obtaining reports from devices that are currently showing offline.\n\n## Document_22\n\nPeplink devices allow users to create schedules that can be applied to a Wi-Fi SSID to turn it off at specific times or to a firewall rule to block user traffic on wired connections during designated periods.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe abnormal LCD display issue on the Balance 305 is attributed to a hardware component degradation related to the LPC chipset, which causes a communication error between the CPU chipset and SERIRQ. This information was provided by Peplink support as the root cause of the problem.\n\n## Document_24\n\nTo resolve an abnormal LCD display issue on a Peplink Balance 305, it may be necessary to check the BIOS battery, as a dead battery can cause display problems. Establish a console connection using SSH with a tool like Putty, and bypass the setup by pressing 'F2' and 'Enter' at the password prompt. To permanently fix the issue, access the BIOS, save the settings, and ensure the BIOS password is set. Activating the parallel port in the BIOS can restore normal functionality to the LCD display.\n\n## Document_25\n\nTo disable the bright blue LED lights on a Peplink access point, one can log into the AP GUI and turn off the LEDs entirely, as there is no option to do this via InControl2.\n\n",

This ensures that if one power source fails, another can seamlessly take over without interruption. This feature is present in models such as the Transit and HD2/4 series routers.\n\n## Document_3\n\nTo regain access to a Pepwave device after a password change error, one can either factory default the unit or use InControl2 (IC2) to change the password.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Max HotSpot supports Virtual WAN (VWAN) as it is compatible with firmware version 8.3, which includes this feature.\n\n## Document_5\n\nAfter updating the firmware on a Pepwave SOHO MK3 from version 8.0.2 to 8.1.0, the device still displays the previous firmware version after rebooting. However, the new firmware version 8.1.0 is confirmed to work perfectly on the device.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe default SSID of a Pepwave device should end with the last four digits of the serial number.

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nThe issue with the Pepwave Sure SOHO MK3's 2.4GHz SSID not allowing certain clients to connect after a period of time may be related to the WiFi connection between the affected clients and the router. While the 2.4GHz SSID is still visible, affected clients cannot connect to it after disconnection, although it reappears after some time. The problem does not affect all wireless clients simultaneously, suggesting it may not be a widespread issue with the MK3's WiFi functionality. Signal strength measurements of the affected clients may provide further insight into the problem.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe Max HotSpot supports Virtual WAN (VWAN) as it is compatible with firmware version 8.3, which includes this feature.\n\n## Document_3\n\nTo resolve connection issues between a Peplink Balance One and a cable modem, it is recommended to change the Physical Interface Speed setting to 100M full duplex in the WAN configuration. Additionally, adjusting the 'advertise speed' option may also be necessary, either by checking or un-checking it, depending on the specific setup.\n\n## Document_4\n\nTo configure a static route on a Peplink Balance 580 for reaching a remote subnet over a WAN link, one should use an outbound policy to direct traffic to the specific destination network via the desired WAN link, rather than attempting to configure static routes under LAN settings.\n\n## Document_5\n\nFor a Peplink Balance 380 setup with IP forwarding, if the ISP's router does not support static forwarding, it is necessary to add a static route to the ISP router. This route should direct traffic intended for the 10.1.1.0/24 network to be forwarded via the Peplink router's IP address (192.168.1.254). Without this configuration, PCs on the 10.1.1.0/24 network will not receive responses for their internet requests. If static routes cannot be configured on the ISP router, the WAN on the Peplink B380 must operate in NAT mode to allow internet access.\n\n## Document_6\n\nTo configure a static route on a Peplink Balance 380, navigate to the network settings, then LAN, and enter the destination network IP along with the appropriate subnet mask and gateway IP. For example, use a destination network IP like 10.181.34.0 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.252 and a gateway of 10.181.32.1. Additionally, NAT mappings should be set up to map the local subnet IP to the WAN1 connection. It is also important to ensure that the point-to-point connection is properly connected and shows as active on the device.\n\n## Document_7\n\nTo route traffic from a remote site directly to the internet using a Peplink Balance 380 appliance, a LAN static route can be configured to direct traffic from the remote site's subnet (192.168.2.0/24) through SpeedFusion to a specified gateway (192.168.1.252). It is also suggested to consider the use of a 0.0.0.0 netmask in future firmware updates for better routing capabilities. Additionally, it is important to confirm whether the HQ Peplink is functioning as the DHCP server for the local subnet (192.168.1.0/24).\n\n## Document_8\n\nTo address WAN connection drops with a Peplink Balance One and a Motorola cable modem, changing the WAN speed setting from Auto to 100Mb and unchecking the 'advertise speed' option has proven effective in resolving communication issues. The user experienced several lost connections daily on Auto but has not encountered this problem since making the adjustment. It is noted that the internet service speed is lower than 100Mb, so this change does not impact the user's internet performance. The firmware version in use is 7.02.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe Peplink Balance 380 is experiencing intermittent time synchronization failures while running firmware version 6.3.2. Upgrading to firmware version 7.1 is a consideration, but there are concerns about potential VPN issues associated with that version. Users should be aware of these issues before proceeding with the upgrade.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThere is a known issue with sorting the Download and Upload columns in the Client list of the Status section on the Balance One Core running firmware version 7.1. This sorting issue will be addressed in the upcoming firmware version 7.1.1, which is tentatively scheduled for release in late April.\n\n## Document_11\n\nTo troubleshoot outbound PepVPN rules on a Peplink Balance running firmware version 6.2.0, it is recommended to use the ping command instead of trace routes, as trace routes do not function properly in an encrypted SpeedFusion tunnel. The PepVPN routes will not update on the Status > SpeedFusion page since they are learned routes. To verify the routing, initiate a constant ping from a local host to a remote host, then check the Status > Active Sessions on the Balance directing the traffic to the remote end. Filtering for ICMP packets will confirm if the traffic is using the intended tunnel, with packets appearing on the correct site and not on others.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo troubleshoot issues with page freezing while using a bonded ADSL setup on a Peplink Balance 20, it is suggested to connect one ADSL line directly to a PC to determine if the issue persists. If the freezing continues, it may indicate a problem with the ISP rather than the router or configuration. The firmware version in use is 5.4.6 build 1585.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe MAX BR1 Pro 5G is experiencing performance issues, with download speeds reported to be 100-200Mbps lower and upload speeds 10-20Mbps lower compared to other 5G products like the Netgear Nighthawk 5G, despite similar signal strengths and band usage. Users have noted that the device sometimes connects as 4G/LTE-A instead of 5G, with inconsistent connection type reporting on the dashboard. The firmware version 8.1.2 and subsequent updates have not resolved these performance issues, and users are questioning whether there are known bugs affecting the connection stability and speed optimization.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe most recent API documentation available for Peplink devices is for firmware version 8.3.0, and there is currently no documentation released for version 8.4.0.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe MAX Transit LTE-A device is running the latest 8.1.1 RC3 firmware. Users have experienced intermittent disconnections or failure to connect with M1 Macbooks, and disabling the 5GHz channel while using only the 2.4GHz channel has temporarily mitigated the issue, although this is not a long-term solution. One user reported no issues with their M1 Air on the same firmware version.\n\n## Document_16\n\nIn Drop-in mode, support for VLAN clients to route traffic over the WAN was added in firmware version 8.1.0. This allows for the use of WAN1 from local networks even when in Drop-in mode, which may resolve issues related to VLANs not having internet access while the WAN is active. Configuration steps for Drop-in mode can be found in the user manual for firmware version 8.1.0.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo address missing NMEA information from a MAX TST modem, it is important to check the GPS antenna and its cable to ensure they are securely connected. Empty NMEA strings are often indicative of signal or reception issues, which could be affecting the modem's ability to provide complete data.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Surf SOHO router has an option in the Web Admin interface that allows users to temporarily disable or block a specific device's WiFi connectivity. This feature is available in firmware version 8.1.3GA.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe Peplink Surf SOHO MK3 uses NAT to block unwanted inbound traffic, even though the default inbound firewall rule allows all traffic. The firewall rules are considered additional to the NAT function. By default, the firewall does not block any outbound ports unless specifically configured to do so.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe 's' in the firmware version indicates a special build firmware, which is often created by Peplink to include specific feature requests. For instance, firmware version 8.0.2s033 included features such as Firewall and Region/SaaS, which are later incorporated into the next general available firmware version.\n\n## Document_21\n\nIn the context of Pepwave devices, VLANs do not have an on/off state; rather, it is the SSIDs that can be enabled or disabled. The schedule settings for SSIDs do not control the VLAN directly. Users should focus on the 'Enabled' checkbox for the SSID instead of relying on the schedule for VLAN management, as VLANs can be defined without being actively used.\n\n## Document_22\n\nFirmware version 6.3.1 is expected to contain a fix for connectivity issues experienced with certain devices on the LAN side of the Pepwave Surf SOHO router after upgrading to firmware 6.3.0, which caused two of the three devices to lose connectivity and not appear on the Status Client List.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe Surf Soho router running firmware version 6.1.2 has a bandwidth monitor that resets usage data based on the calendar month rather than the ISP billing cycle. Users have expressed a need for the ability to set the data monitor to align with their billing cycle for better tracking of data usage. Currently, the router does not support this feature, leading to confusion as users must manually calculate their data usage by combining the last days of the previous month with the current month's total.\n\n## Document_24\n\nTo update the firmware on a Max BR1 Mini, access the web GUI by entering the device's IP address (192.168.50.1) and logging in with the default username and password (admin/admin). Check the current firmware version under the status tab; if it is 7.1.1, you must first upgrade to 7.1.2 before proceeding to 8.0. Download the necessary firmware files from the Peplink support site, ensuring to check the firmware archive for intermediate versions. Perform the upgrade by dragging the firmware file into the manual upgrade section of the web GUI. The upgrade process takes up to six minutes, indicated by the status light changing from red to green. After upgrading to 7.1.2, repeat the process to upgrade to 8.0, confirming the successful upgrade by checking the status page again. These steps apply to any Peplink or Pepwave device.\n\n## Document_25\n\nThe Pepwave Sure SOHO MK3 is experiencing connectivity issues with its 2.4 GHz SSID, where devices can connect for a few hours before losing the ability to connect, although the SSID remains visible. The 5 GHz band continues to function without issues. The firmware version 7.1.0 operates correctly, while version 8.0.0 appears to cause connectivity problems after a period of time.\n\n## Document_26\n\nThe Pepwave Sure SOHO MK3 is experiencing connectivity issues with the 2.4 GHz SSID, which connects for a few hours before stopping connections, while the 5 GHz SSID remains accessible. The issue appears to be related to firmware version 8.0.0, as the device operates normally on firmware version 7.1.0. The problem may not affect all devices connecting to the 2.4 GHz network, indicating that it could be device-specific.\n\n## Document_27\n\nTo troubleshoot connectivity issues between a Peplink Balance One and a cable modem, it is recommended to check the modem's connection to the internet provider by connecting a computer directly to the modem for testing.\n\n## Document_28\n\nTo resolve connection issues between a Peplink Balance One and a cable modem, setting the MAC address clone to match the MAC address of another device on the network can be effective. This adjustment may help in establishing a successful connection, although the underlying reason for this fix is not clearly understood.\n\n## Document_29\n\nIn a Peplink Balance 380 setup with IP forwarding, if there is no internet access to hosts behind the router, it may be due to limitations on the ISP's router, which does not allow IPv4 static forwarding. The user has managed to establish static IP routing through the ISP router's shell and can ping the ISP LAN Gateway, but still cannot ping devices within the Peplink network, indicating potential configuration issues or restrictions on the ISP side.\n\n## Document_30\n\nTo resolve internet access issues for hosts behind a Peplink Balance 380 setup with IP forwarding, disabling AP isolation on the ISP's router can be necessary. This configuration change allows proper communication between the devices connected to the Peplink router and the internet.\n\n## Document_31\n\nTo configure a Peplink Balance 380 for a dedicated WAN connection to a data center, a static route can be set to direct all traffic (0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255) to the data center's firewall IP (10.120.2.81). Although the static route section under LAN may not seem intended for this purpose, it is possible to set up such a route. Additionally, for VoIP networks, creating a separate VLAN and disabling Inter-VLAN routing for the VoIP subnet is a recommended practice.\n\n## Document_32\n\nTo configure a Peplink Balance 380 for a dedicated WAN connection, it is necessary to set up a static route directing all traffic (0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255) to the IP address of the remote firewall (10.120.2.81). It is recommended to update the firmware to the latest version (6.2.2) for improved functionality. Additionally, when using static routes, ensure that the outbound policy is set to allow all traffic (ANY) and enforce it through the primary WAN connection (WAN 1).\n\n## Document_33\n\nTo configure a Peplink Balance 380 for a dedicated WAN connection to a datacenter, a static route needs to be set to direct all traffic (0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255) to the datacenter's firewall IP (10.120.2.81). However, the static route configuration under LAN requires the gateway to be on the local LAN, which presents a challenge if the IP is not within the local subnet (192.168.1.0/24). Additionally, there is a query regarding the appropriate NAT mappings for the WAN 1 connection, specifically whether to use the local network or the datacenter's network for configuration.\n\n## Document_34\n\nTo configure a Peplink Balance 380 for a dedicated WAN connection to a datacenter, a static route needs to be set to direct all traffic (0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255) to the datacenter's firewall IP (10.120.2.81). The user is testing with a Balance 30 configured with firmware version 6.2.2, and has set up both WAN and LAN connections, along with outbound rules, but is experiencing issues with the configuration. It is suggested to verify if the point-to-point connection is restricted by MAC address.\n\n## Document_35\n\nTo configure a Peplink Balance 380 for a dedicated circuit to a datacenter, it is suggested to use outbound policy and enable NAT for the WAN connection. NAT mappings should be implemented to WAN1 to ensure proper routing of traffic. It is also advisable to consult with the datacenter engineers to verify the configuration and ensure compatibility with their network setup.\n\n## Document_36\n\nTo send traffic from a remote site directly to the internet using a Peplink Balance 380 appliance, outbound policy can be leveraged to create a default route. The user is currently using firmware version 5.4.1 and has modified their network setup by changing the LAN interface to drop-in mode with WAN3, adding a default gateway, and connecting WAN3 to the same switch as the LAN. However, the proper method to establish a default route on the HQ Balance appliance involves configuring outbound policies rather than relying solely on the modified setup.\n\n",

    "query": "How should a technician configure a Peplink Balance 380 to route all traffic through a dedicated WAN connection to a datacenter, considering static routes, NAT, and outbound policy, and what challenges might arise with gateway settings?",
    "answer": "To route all traffic from a Peplink Balance 380 through a dedicated WAN connection to a datacenter, the technician should set a static route for all traffic (0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255) pointing to the datacenter firewall's IP (e.g., 10.120.2.81). This static route is typically configured under the LAN static routes section, but the gateway for the static route must be on the local LAN subnet, which can be a challenge if the datacenter firewall IP is not on the same subnet as the LAN. To ensure proper traffic flow, outbound policy should be set to allow all (ANY) and enforced through the primary WAN connection (WAN1). NAT mappings should be set up to map the local subnet to WAN1, and NAT should be enabled for the WAN connection. Coordination with datacenter engineers is recommended to verify configurations and ensure compatibility. If the static route configuration is not possible due to gateway subnet restrictions, using outbound policy to create a default route and enabling NAT for WAN1 is an alternative. Firmware updates (e.g., to version 6.2.2) may provide improved functionality for these tasks.",

The device should be set up to manage DNS records, including A records, directly on the Peplink device instead of relying on a third-party DNS server. This setup will allow for the removal of existing DNS entries from the third-party vendor and ensure that the Peplink device handles all DNS configurations accordingly while balancing the ISP load.\n\n## Document_2\n\nTo stabilize a public IP address when using a Peplink 700 load balancer with multiple ISPs, obtaining static IP addresses from the ISPs is recommended, as dynamic IP addresses will change. An alternative solution is to use a FusionHub Solo in the cloud, allowing the Peplink 700 to make outbound connections to it, which can help manage inbound connections and maintain a consistent public IP address.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe Peplink Balance can serve as an authoritative DNS server to facilitate inbound load balancing and failover. For specific guidance on implementing inbound load balancing, users can refer to the Peplink knowledgebase for detailed instructions.\n\n## Document_4\n\nWhen creating outbound rules on a Peplink 310 to manage internet connections for uploads to a specific domain, it is important to understand that the server receiving requests cannot differentiate between upload and download paths based solely on the outbound rule. If an outbound rule is applied to a specific WAN IP for uploads, the corresponding download responses will also be routed through the same WAN IP, as the server does not have the capability to send responses to a different IP address than the one that initiated the request.\n\n## Document_5\n\nTo achieve inbound load balancing on a Peplink 305 with a dual WAN setup, the Peplink DNS service must be enabled. This can be done by either configuring DNS records within the Peplink Balance, making it the public DNS server, or by delegating a sub-domain to the Peplink from an existing authoritative DNS server. Both methods require the DNS service on the Peplink to be active to facilitate proper load balancing between the WAN connections.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Peplink 305 is rated for a maximum throughput of 200 Mbps and is suitable for up to 500 users. However, in a scenario where an organization has over 2000-2500 users and a combined bandwidth requirement of 300 Mbps, the Peplink 305 is considered undersized. For better performance and to accommodate growth in both user count and bandwidth, the Peplink 1350 is recommended as a more suitable option.\n\n## Document_7\n\nPeplink Balance routers support inbound load balancing, allowing external users to connect to a server using a DNS name. The router acts as the authoritative DNS server for the domain, resolving the domain name to an active Public WAN IP. If a WAN link fails, the router will only respond to DNS requests with the Public IPs of WANs that are currently live, ensuring continuous connectivity without changing the public IP or causing disconnections.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe Peplink Balance 210 and higher models have a built-in authoritative DNS server that can facilitate inbound load balancing and failover. This feature allows for automatic DNS updates when the primary WAN goes down and the backup WAN comes up, regardless of whether the WAN IPs are static or dynamic.\n\n## Document_9\n\nTo troubleshoot connectivity issues between two Peplink 580 devices in a site-to-site VPN setup, it is recommended to check the firewall rules on the Peplink at the head office. This may resolve the issue where devices at the satellite office can only ping the Peplink at the head office but not other devices on the head office network.\n\n## Document_10\n\nPeplink Balance models 210, 310, 305, 380, 580, 710, and 1350 have a built-in DNS server that supports Inbound Load Balancing, which distributes inbound data traffic over multiple WAN links. This functionality is configured using DNS records within Peplink Balance and external DNS records at an authoritative DNS server. When a client queries for a domain like foobar.com, the authoritative DNS server delegates resolution to Peplink Balance, which can return IP addresses corresponding to available WAN links. If both WAN links are operational, both IP addresses are returned; if one is down, only the operational IP address is returned. Peplink Balance 20 and 30 do not support authoritative DNS functionality.\n\n## Document_11\n\nInbound Load Balancing on Peplink Balance devices distributes inbound data traffic over multiple WAN links to computers or servers behind the router. Models such as the Peplink Balance 210, 310, 305, 380, 580, 710, and 1350 include a built-in DNS server that supports this functionality, while the Balance 20 and 30 do not. Inbound Load Balancing can be configured using DNS records within Peplink Balance or through external DNS records at an authoritative DNS server. When Peplink Balance acts as an authoritative DNS server, it resolves hostnames by returning IP addresses corresponding to available WAN links, allowing for load balancing based on WAN link status.\n\n## Document_12\n\nPeplink Balance models 210, 310, 305, 380, 580, 710, and 1350 support Inbound Load Balancing through a built-in DNS server, which allows for the distribution of inbound data traffic over multiple WAN links to servers behind the router. This functionality is not available on the Peplink Balance 20 and 30. Inbound Load Balancing can be configured using DNS records within Peplink Balance or by delegating a sub-domain to Peplink from an external authoritative DNS server.

Configuration can be done through DNS records within Peplink Balance or by delegating a sub-domain to Peplink from an external authoritative DNS server. The DNS server responds to queries by returning IP addresses corresponding to available WAN links, utilizing a Round Robin algorithm for load balancing or allowing for a primary WAN with failover capabilities to another WAN if the primary fails.\n\n## Document_14\n\nInbound Load Balancing on Peplink Balance devices distributes inbound data traffic over multiple WAN links to computers or servers behind the router. Models such as the Peplink Balance 210, 310, 305, 380, 580, 710, and 1350 include a built-in DNS server that facilitates this functionality, while the Balance 20 and 30 do not. Configuration involves setting DNS records within Peplink Balance or delegating a sub-domain to Peplink. When a client queries the DNS for a domain, Peplink Balance responds with IP addresses corresponding to available WAN links, ensuring traffic is balanced across them. If one WAN link is down, the DNS protocol allows the client to query the other available WAN link for resolution.\n\n## Document_15\n\nInbound Load Balancing on Peplink Balance routers distributes inbound data traffic over multiple WAN links to servers behind the router.

Configuration can be done through DNS records within Peplink Balance or by delegating a sub-domain to Peplink. When a client queries the Peplink DNS server for a domain, the server returns IP addresses corresponding to available WAN links, enabling traffic distribution. For this setup to function correctly, a static IP is required on each ISP connection.\n\n## Document_16\n\nInbound Load Balancing on Peplink Balance devices distributes inbound data traffic over multiple WAN links to servers behind the router.

Configuration can be done through DNS records within the Peplink Balance or by delegating a sub-domain to Peplink. When a client queries the DNS for a domain, the Peplink Balance responds with IP addresses corresponding to available WAN links, allowing for seamless traffic distribution. If one WAN link is down, the DNS query can still succeed through the other available link, ensuring continuous service availability.\n\n## Document_17\n\nInbound Load Balancing on Peplink Balance devices distributes inbound data traffic over multiple WAN links to computers or servers. The devices equipped with a built-in DNS server, such as the Peplink Balance 210, 310, 305, 380, 580, 710, and 1350, can manage DNS records to facilitate this load balancing. When a client queries the Peplink DNS server for a domain, the server responds with the IP addresses corresponding to available WAN links. If both WAN links are operational, both IP addresses are returned; if one link is down, only the operational link's IP address is returned. This mechanism does not allow a single computer to utilize both ISPs simultaneously for increased bandwidth but rather alternates between them based on availability.\n\n## Document_18\n\nPeplink Balance devices, specifically models 210, 310, 305, 380, 580, 710, and 1350, have a built-in DNS server that enables Inbound Load Balancing by distributing inbound data traffic over multiple WAN links to servers behind the device. This functionality is not available on Peplink Balance 20 and 30. Inbound Load Balancing can be configured through DNS records within Peplink Balance or by delegating a sub-domain to Peplink from an external authoritative DNS server. When a client queries the Peplink DNS server for a domain, it returns the IP addresses corresponding to available WAN links, allowing for traffic distribution based on WAN availability. If one WAN is down, the DNS server will only return the IP address of the available WAN, ensuring that traffic is directed appropriately based on WAN status.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe recommended maximum number of simultaneous OpenVPN users from branches to a Peplink Balance 20X hub device is 15. To increase the number of OpenVPN users, it is possible to couple two Peplink Balance 20X devices at the head office, with one dedicated to remote user VPN connections. However, this setup may complicate access for remote VPN users to resources on the local area network of the hub device.\n\n## Document_20\n\nTo stabilize the public IP address when using a Peplink 700 load balancer with multiple ISPs, one can implement a priority outbound policy to ensure traffic is consistently routed through the same ISP WAN unless it becomes unavailable, at which point it will switch to the next ISP in the priority list. This approach contrasts with weighted load balancing, which can lead to varying public IP addresses.\n\n## Document_21\n\nWhen creating outbound rules on a Peplink 310, it is important to note that outbound sessions established over a specific WAN connection will have their return traffic come back on the same WAN connection. This means that if an outbound rule is set to use certain connections for uploads, the corresponding downloads will also occur over those connections, affecting the intended separation of upload and download traffic.\n\n## Document_22\n\nTo create an outbound rule on a Peplink 310 that allows specific internet connections to be used for uploads to a domain without affecting downloads, it is suggested to create a new rule that specifies the source IP of the device or computer that should use the designated WAN connection. This approach ensures that only uploads are routed through the selected connections while downloads can continue using other connections.\n\n## Document_23\n\nTo create an outbound rule on a Peplink 310 that allows specific internet connections to be used for uploads to a domain without affecting downloads, it is essential that uploads and downloads use different ports. If both uploads and downloads use the same port, such as FTP, it is not possible to separate them, as the remote server cannot direct responses to different IPs for the same session. This limitation applies particularly when using HTTPS, as both uploads and downloads would typically occur over the same port.\n\n## Document_24\n\nPeplink Balance models 210, 310, 305, 380, 580, 710, and 1350 feature a built-in DNS server that supports Inbound Load Balancing, allowing distribution of inbound data traffic over multiple WAN links to servers behind the device. The DNS server can be configured to hold all domain records, and modifications to the Name Server record at the Domain Registrar are necessary for migration. When a client queries the Peplink DNS server, it returns IP addresses corresponding to available WAN links, facilitating load balancing. If a WAN connection fails, the DNS query mechanism allows for fallback to an alternate WAN, but there may be a delay in routing new requests to the alternate connection if the primary WAN is down, depending on the configuration and settings of the device.\n\n",

      "To stabilize the public IP address when using a Peplink 700 load balancer with multiple ISPs, one can implement a priority outbound policy to ensure traffic is consistently routed through the same ISP WAN unless it becomes unavailable, at which point it will switch to the next ISP in the priority list. This approach contrasts with weighted load balancing, which can lead to varying public IP addresses.",
      "When creating outbound rules on a Peplink 310, it is important to note that outbound sessions established over a specific WAN connection will have their return traffic come back on the same WAN connection. This means that if an outbound rule is set to use certain connections for uploads, the corresponding downloads will also occur over those connections, affecting the intended separation of upload and download traffic.",
      "To create an outbound rule on a Peplink 310 that allows specific internet connections to be used for uploads to a domain without affecting downloads, it is suggested to create a new rule that specifies the source IP of the device or computer that should use the designated WAN connection. This approach ensures that only uploads are routed through the selected connections while downloads can continue using other connections.",
      "To create an outbound rule on a Peplink 310 that allows specific internet connections to be used for uploads to a domain without affecting downloads, it is essential that uploads and downloads use different ports. If both uploads and downloads use the same port, such as FTP, it is not possible to separate them, as the remote server cannot direct responses to different IPs for the same session. This limitation applies particularly when using HTTPS, as both uploads and downloads would typically occur over the same port.",

The DNS server can be configured to hold all domain records, and modifications to the Name Server record at the Domain Registrar are necessary for migration. When a client queries the Peplink DNS server, it returns IP addresses corresponding to available WAN links, facilitating load balancing. If a WAN connection fails, the DNS query mechanism allows for fallback to an alternate WAN, but there may be a delay in routing new requests to the alternate connection if the primary WAN is down, depending on the configuration and settings of the device."

    "query": "How does the Peplink Balance enable inbound load balancing using its built-in DNS server, what models support this feature, and how is DNS configuration managed to ensure traffic is balanced across multiple WAN links and failover is handled?",
    "answer": "Peplink Balance routers (models 210, 310, 305, 380, 580, 710, and 1350) support inbound load balancing via a built-in authoritative DNS server. This server distributes inbound traffic across multiple WAN links by responding to DNS queries for a domain with the IP addresses of currently available WAN connections. Configuration can be managed by creating DNS records directly on the Peplink device, making it the authoritative DNS server for the domain, or by delegating a sub-domain from an external DNS server to the Peplink. If a WAN link fails, the DNS server automatically excludes its IP from responses and only returns the IP addresses of operational WANs, ensuring inbound traffic is directed to available links for failover and continuous connectivity. The Balance 20 and 30 do not support this DNS-based inbound load balancing feature.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nFor high availability (HA) configurations with Peplink Balance 710 devices, using an active/active setup is recommended over an active/passive VRRP HA-pair due to the slow failover times associated with VRRP, which can exceed 30 seconds. In cases where compliance requires an active/passive configuration, VRRP may still be used, but it is considered cumbersome and outdated compared to active/active configurations that allow for faster failover and better resource utilization.\n\n## Document_2\n\nPeplink's high availability (HA) feature operates on a master/slave architecture, where one router is designated as the master and the other as a backup. The backup router remains inactive while the master is operational, only becoming active if the master fails. This implementation does not support a peer-to-peer relationship where both routers can independently manage their own WANs and VLANs while providing backup for each other. The HA configuration requires synchronization of settings between the master and slave, which is optional but necessary for the slave to be prepared for activation in case of a master failure. If synchronization is not enabled, the slave must be manually configured to match the master.\n\n## Document_3\n\nIn a high availability (HA) setup using Peplink Balance routers in NAT mode, VRRP is utilized for WAN as well as LAN configurations. When properly configured, VRRP allows for the transfer of WAN addresses from the master router to the slave router in the event of a failure. This means that only one public IP address is needed for the HA setup, as the slave router will take over the master router's public IP address upon failure, rather than requiring multiple public IP addresses for each router.\n\n## Document_4\n\nIn a high availability (HA) setup for Peplink Balance routers in NAT mode, the LAN configuration requires a Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) setup with a virtual IP (VIP) for the master and slave units. For the WAN configuration, two options are presented. Option 1 requires three VRRP groups: one for the LAN and one for each ISP, necessitating a total of six public IP addresses. Option 2 suggests a simpler configuration with only two public IP addresses, where the master unit handles both WAN connections and the slave unit takes over the WAN IP address upon failover. The WAN setup involves two ISPs, each with its own subnet and gateway.\n\n## Document_5\n\nIn a High Availability (HA) setup using two Peplink Balance 380 routers configured with VRRP, issues may arise when both routers compete for the master role, particularly during internet connectivity loss. This can lead to network downtime as the routers transition between master and slave roles. The VRRP protocol relies on periodic advertisement packets sent from the master device to maintain the master-slave relationship. If both routers remain connected to the LAN and are aware of each other's WAN connectivity, conflicts over the master role can occur, especially if one router fails to recognize the recovery of the other after a power cycle. Proper diagnostics and physical connection details are crucial for troubleshooting these issues effectively.\n\n## Document_6\n\nPepwave routers support high availability configurations using the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) as defined in RFC 3768, allowing for redundancy and failover in a master-slave arrangement. In this configuration, two Pepwave routers communicate over the LAN using VRRP, broadcasting heartbeat signals at a frequency of one per second. If the master router fails to send a heartbeat signal for 3 seconds or longer, the slave router activates, initiates WAN connections, and binds to a preconfigured LAN IP address. Upon recovery, the master router will regain its active status by default.\n\n## Document_7\n\nPeplink Balance devices, specifically models 210 and above, support High Availability (HA) failover using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). In an HA setup, periodic VRRP advertisement packets are sent from the master device to specific IP multicast addresses, allowing the slave device to take over if the master fails. The virtual IP (VIP) serves as the default gateway for LAN devices, and both master and slave units must be on the same subnet with a unique HA group identifier. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave to automatically apply changes from the master every five minutes, but this locks the slave's web admin interface until disabled. Failover typically occurs within 10-15 seconds, and both devices must be connected to the internet in the same mode, either NAT or Drop-in mode, with the VIP set as the default gateway for LAN hosts.\n\n## Document_8\n\nTo implement a 1+1 Backup using Peplink Balance devices or MAX 700/HD in active-standby mode, both devices must support High Availability (HA) failover based on Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). The master device sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets to specific multicast addresses, allowing the slave device to take over if the master fails. The devices must be on the same subnet and use the same HA group identifier. Configuration involves setting up a virtual IP (VIP) as the default gateway for LAN hosts, and additional Ethernet switches are recommended to prevent a single point of failure. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave unit to automatically obtain changes from the master unit, or it can be configured manually. The failover typically occurs within 10-15 seconds, and both units must be connected to the internet in the same mode (NAT or Drop-in).\n\n## Document_9\n\nIn a 1+1 backup configuration using Peplink Balance devices or MAX 700/HD, High Availability (HA) failover is achieved through the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). The master device sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets to specific multicast addresses, and if these packets are not received within a defined time interval, the slave device assumes the master’s responsibilities. The configuration requires both devices to be on the same subnet and to use the same HA group identifier. The virtual IP address (VIP) serves as the default gateway for all LAN hosts. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave unit to automatically apply changes from the master unit, or it can be configured manually. Failover typically occurs within 10-15 seconds, and both devices must be connected to the internet in the same mode, either NAT or Drop-in mode.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo implement a 1+1 Backup High Availability (HA) setup with Peplink Balance devices, both the master and slave devices must be configured to operate in active-standby mode using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). The master device sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets, and the slave takes over if these packets are not received within a defined time interval. Configuration involves setting a virtual IP address (VIP) as the default gateway for LAN devices, ensuring both units are on the same subnet, and using a unique HA group identifier. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave unit to automatically receive updates from the master. In case of a master device failure, the slave assumes the master role, and the configuration can be restored by uploading the saved configuration from the slave to the new master device, ensuring that the LAN IP and hostname are updated accordingly. SpeedFusion VPN tunnels remain intact as they are not tied to the device's hostname but to the PepVPN Local ID.\n\n## Document_11\n\nPeplink Balance devices and MAX 700/HD can operate in active-standby mode for High Availability (HA) failover, utilizing Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) to manage traffic. The master device sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets to specific multicast addresses, and if these packets are not received within a set time, the slave device takes over. Both devices must be on the same subnet and use the same HA group identifier. Configuration for HA includes enabling settings for both master and slave units, with options for configuration synchronization every five minutes or manual configuration. Failover typically occurs within 10-15 seconds, and both devices should connect to the internet in the same mode, either NAT or Drop-in mode, with the virtual IP address serving as the default gateway for LAN hosts.\n\n## Document_12\n\nHigh Availability (HA) failover is supported on the Peplink BR1 routers starting from Firmware 7, allowing a slave unit to take over when a master unit fails, providing hardware redundancy. This failover is based on the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), where a heartbeat is sent from the master to the slave. If the heartbeat is lost, the slave assumes the master’s role. Both BR1 routers must be connected to the same LAN, and they can use separate cellular WAN connections. Configuration requires setting the same HA group number, a Virtual IP address, and individual IP addresses for each router. The master device's configuration can be synchronized to the slave device, and testing can be done by disconnecting the master to ensure the slave takes over.\n\n## Document_13\n\nHigh Availability (HA) failover is supported on the Peplink MAX BR1 starting from Firmware 7, allowing a slave unit to take over the role of a master unit in case of failure, providing hardware redundancy. HA failover utilizes the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), where a heartbeat is sent from the master to the slave device. Both BR1 routers must be connected to the same LAN for VRRP to function, and they can use separate cellular WAN connections. Configuration requires setting the same HA group number on both devices, defining a Virtual IP address that serves as the default gateway for the LAN, and assigning additional IP addresses to each router. The configuration process involves logging into the master device, enabling HA, and applying the settings, followed by configuring the slave device to synchronize settings with the master.\n\n## Document_14\n\nHigh availability mode on Peplink routers, also known as Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), allows for seamless failover between two routers configured in master and slave mode. In this setup, one router (the master) handles all connectivity, while the other (the slave) remains on standby. If the master router experiences a failure, the slave router automatically takes over within approximately 15 seconds, ensuring continuous internet connectivity. The demonstration involved two Peplink Balance 380 routers, with an active ping to Google's public DNS to monitor connectivity. When the master router was turned off, the pings stopped, but once the slave router assumed master status, the pings resumed, demonstrating the effectiveness of the high availability setup. The process also includes the ability for the master router to regain control once it is powered back on, reverting the roles of the routers accordingly.\n\n## Document_15\n\nHigh Availability (HA) mode, also known as HA mode, provides hardware redundancy by allowing a slave unit to take over the role of a master unit in the event of a failure. This failover mechanism is based on the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), which sends a heartbeat signal from the master device to the slave device. If the heartbeat is lost due to hardware failure or disconnection, the slave unit assumes the master role. The setup involves configuring two Peplink Balance 20X devices, where the master device is set up first by enabling HA mode, selecting the master role, and configuring a virtual IP address that serves as the default gateway for connected hosts. The slave device is then configured to sync its settings with the master either automatically or manually, ensuring it has a different LAN IP address. The failover process typically takes 10 to 15 seconds, during which all line connections are re-established. Successful configuration can be verified through the web admin dashboard of the slave device, which will indicate that HA mode is enabled.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe video discusses the setup of High Availability (HA) for Peplink SDN routers, focusing on configuring a master and a slave router for service provider failover and redundancy. The master router is already in production with a unique LAN IP address of 192.168.1.12.1 and a shared virtual IP of 192.168.1.12.3. The slave router is assigned a unique LAN IP of 192.168.1.12.2 and must be configured to match the HA settings of the master, including group number and preferred role. The configuration sync option allows the slave router to automatically receive updates from the master every five minutes, ensuring consistent settings. After applying the configurations, the HA status is confirmed on both devices, indicating successful setup.\n\n## Document_17\n\nWhen using a pair of Balance 710s as a high availability (HA) pair, the failover process can result in significant downtime due to the lack of real session synchronization, with outages exceeding 30 seconds. An alternative approach is to configure two independent Balance 710s and connect each branch office to both devices, which may require more configuration work but can lead to faster failover. The use of OSPF routes and path costs can also influence the failover time and network performance.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe high availability feature of the Peplink Balance 20X can cause issues with cable modems, particularly those from Comcast, due to the changing of the Ethernet MAC address on the WAN port. This can lead to the modem becoming unresponsive, as it is sensitive to MAC address changes. The MAC address used during high availability is an unassigned IANA MAC address (00:00:5e:01:01:fa), which is not appropriate for this function. The expected virtual MAC address for VRRP should be 00:00:5e:00:01:fa. When high availability is enabled, the WAN port may show a private IP address instead of the public IP, and the WAN status may indicate down due to DNS test failures, suggesting that the modem is not passing traffic from the router. Packet captures during this time may yield unexpected results, such as capturing LAN traffic instead of WAN traffic.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20X high availability feature has limitations in its VRRP implementation, allowing a device to be a master or backup for only one network, which may not meet the needs for more complex configurations. Issues with the cable modem may arise when high availability is enabled, potentially due to the WAN port using a virtual MAC address, resulting in a private IP address instead of the expected public IP. The WAN status may show as down if the DNS test fails, indicating that the modem is not passing traffic from the router. Packet captures during this time may yield unexpected results, such as capturing LAN traffic instead of WAN traffic.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe Peplink Max HD4 can function as a backup router in a VRRP configuration alongside two other routers, where it can serve as the third backup router. However, the default VRRP priority for the HD4 is not specified, and it appears that the configuration does not allow for setting a specific priority value. It is implied that if the HD4 adheres to standard VRRP operation, it should work without issues in this topology.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo implement a 1+1 Backup using Peplink Balance devices or MAX 700/HD, both devices must operate in active-standby mode, utilizing High Availability (HA) failover based on Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). The master device sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets to a multicast address, and the slave device takes over if these packets are not received within a specified interval. Both devices must be on the same subnet and share the same HA group identifier. The configuration requires setting a virtual IP (VIP) as the default gateway for LAN hosts, and additional Ethernet switches are recommended to avoid a single point of failure. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave unit to automatically apply changes from the master unit, or the slave can be configured manually using an exported configuration file. The failover process typically takes 10-15 seconds, and both devices should be connected to the Internet in the same mode (NAT or Drop-in).\n\n## Document_22\n\nFor implementing a 1+1 Backup with Peplink Balance devices or MAX 700/HD in active-standby mode, the master device handles LAN traffic until it fails, at which point the slave device takes over. Peplink Balance 210 and above support High Availability (HA) failover using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), where periodic VRRP advertisement packets are sent from the master to a multicast address. If these packets are not received within a specified time, the slave assumes the master’s responsibilities. Both devices must be on the same subnet and share the same HA group identifier.

      "For high availability (HA) configurations with Peplink Balance 710 devices, using an active/active setup is recommended over an active/passive VRRP HA-pair due to the slow failover times associated with VRRP, which can exceed 30 seconds. In cases where compliance requires an active/passive configuration, VRRP may still be used, but it is considered cumbersome and outdated compared to active/active configurations that allow for faster failover and better resource utilization.",
      "Peplink's high availability (HA) feature operates on a master/slave architecture, where one router is designated as the master and the other as a backup. The backup router remains inactive while the master is operational, only becoming active if the master fails. This implementation does not support a peer-to-peer relationship where both routers can independently manage their own WANs and VLANs while providing backup for each other. The HA configuration requires synchronization of settings between the master and slave, which is optional but necessary for the slave to be prepared for activation in case of a master failure. If synchronization is not enabled, the slave must be manually configured to match the master.",
      "In a high availability (HA) setup using Peplink Balance routers in NAT mode, VRRP is utilized for WAN as well as LAN configurations. When properly configured, VRRP allows for the transfer of WAN addresses from the master router to the slave router in the event of a failure. This means that only one public IP address is needed for the HA setup, as the slave router will take over the master router's public IP address upon failure, rather than requiring multiple public IP addresses for each router.",
      "In a high availability (HA) setup for Peplink Balance routers in NAT mode, the LAN configuration requires a Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) setup with a virtual IP (VIP) for the master and slave units. For the WAN configuration, two options are presented. Option 1 requires three VRRP groups: one for the LAN and one for each ISP, necessitating a total of six public IP addresses. Option 2 suggests a simpler configuration with only two public IP addresses, where the master unit handles both WAN connections and the slave unit takes over the WAN IP address upon failover. The WAN setup involves two ISPs, each with its own subnet and gateway.",
      "In a High Availability (HA) setup using two Peplink Balance 380 routers configured with VRRP, issues may arise when both routers compete for the master role, particularly during internet connectivity loss. This can lead to network downtime as the routers transition between master and slave roles. The VRRP protocol relies on periodic advertisement packets sent from the master device to maintain the master-slave relationship. If both routers remain connected to the LAN and are aware of each other's WAN connectivity, conflicts over the master role can occur, especially if one router fails to recognize the recovery of the other after a power cycle. Proper diagnostics and physical connection details are crucial for troubleshooting these issues effectively.",
      "Pepwave routers support high availability configurations using the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) as defined in RFC 3768, allowing for redundancy and failover in a master-slave arrangement. In this configuration, two Pepwave routers communicate over the LAN using VRRP, broadcasting heartbeat signals at a frequency of one per second. If the master router fails to send a heartbeat signal for 3 seconds or longer, the slave router activates, initiates WAN connections, and binds to a preconfigured LAN IP address. Upon recovery, the master router will regain its active status by default.",

      "High availability mode on Peplink routers, also known as Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), allows for seamless failover between two routers configured in master and slave mode. In this setup, one router (the master) handles all connectivity, while the other (the slave) remains on standby. If the master router experiences a failure, the slave router automatically takes over within approximately 15 seconds, ensuring continuous internet connectivity. The demonstration involved two Peplink Balance 380 routers, with an active ping to Google's public DNS to monitor connectivity. When the master router was turned off, the pings stopped, but once the slave router assumed master status, the pings resumed, demonstrating the effectiveness of the high availability setup.

      "When using a pair of Balance 710s as a high availability (HA) pair, the failover process can result in significant downtime due to the lack of real session synchronization, with outages exceeding 30 seconds. An alternative approach is to configure two independent Balance 710s and connect each branch office to both devices, which may require more configuration work but can lead to faster failover. The use of OSPF routes and path costs can also influence the failover time and network performance.",
      "The high availability feature of the Peplink Balance 20X can cause issues with cable modems, particularly those from Comcast, due to the changing of the Ethernet MAC address on the WAN port. This can lead to the modem becoming unresponsive, as it is sensitive to MAC address changes. The MAC address used during high availability is an unassigned IANA MAC address (00:00:5e:01:01:fa), which is not appropriate for this function. The expected virtual MAC address for VRRP should be 00:00:5e:00:01:fa. When high availability is enabled, the WAN port may show a private IP address instead of the public IP, and the WAN status may indicate down due to DNS test failures, suggesting that the modem is not passing traffic from the router. Packet captures during this time may yield unexpected results, such as capturing LAN traffic instead of WAN traffic.",

However, this does not equate to bonding in the sense of providing a single connection that combines the speeds of both WANs. For instance, if WAN1 has a speed of 80Mbps and WAN2 has 30Mbps, a single client will be limited to the speed of the faster WAN (80Mbps) unless a more complex bonding solution is implemented to allow the client to utilize the combined speed of both connections (110Mbps).\n\n## Document_2\n\nTo combine two high-speed internet connections effectively, such as a fiber DSL line and a cable connection, bonding is necessary to create a virtual single pipe that aggregates the bandwidth of both connections. The Peplink Balance 2500 and the EPX modular chassis with appropriate expansion cards are capable of supporting over 800Mbps of bonded throughput. However, bonding can be expensive and requires a separate connection point to the internet. Alternatively, Peplink devices can utilize outbound policy for WAN load balancing, allowing for balanced use of both WAN connections for outbound traffic, while inbound traffic would typically be directed to one WAN unless DNS configurations are employed to manage inbound traffic across both connections. This setup can provide failover capabilities, ensuring continuity if one connection fails.\n\n## Document_3\n\nPeplink devices can perform link aggregation or bonding, but this requires setting up a Site-to-Site VPN between two Peplink Balance models 210 or higher; the Balance 30 does not support aggregation. In a typical load balancing scenario, the Peplink Balance utilizes all available WAN connections to optimize bandwidth usage, particularly beneficial in multi-user environments. However, for single-user sessions, the speed is limited to the WAN link being used. Once a Site-to-Site VPN is established, the VPN treats all WAN connections as a single large pipe, allowing traffic to be distributed across all links, which can improve performance.\n\n## Document_4\n\nUsing two Peplink MAX BR1 PRO routers in series with Outbound Policy Weighted Balancing can achieve session balancing according to the defined ratio for each WAN. For true load balancing, Peplink devices can utilize per-packet load balancing through SpeedFusion technology, which helps mitigate issues if either WAN connection becomes degraded or fails.\n\n## Document_5\n\nPeplink Multi-WAN routers can function as load balancers and also support SpeedFusion bonding. Users can implement load balancing for all traffic while reserving SpeedFusion for specific important times by utilizing outbound policies to manage the connections effectively.\n\n## Document_6\n\nA Peplink balance router can perform session-based load balancing, where a single session is limited by the WAN link it is using, but users will see combined bandwidth across all their sessions. For higher bandwidth utilization, SpeedFusion Bonding allows a single session to be distributed at a packet level across multiple WAN links simultaneously. To implement load balancing, a router like the Balance One is recommended, while SpeedFusion requires a device or service to bond traffic, with the option of using SpeedFusion Cloud for easier setup.\n\n## Document_7\n\nLoad balancing does not combine multiple WAN connections into a single high-speed link; it steers traffic over multiple WAN connections while using them separately. To achieve the sum of all WAN connections for upload speeds using a secure connection, Peplink's SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding solution is required. This involves setting up a VPN tunnel between two Peplink devices, allowing the four WAN connections to be bonded into one high-speed link. It is important to note that the other end of the SpeedFusion VPN tunnel must have a WAN connection with at least 80 Mbps speeds to effectively combine the four 20 Mbps WAN connections.\n\n## Document_8\n\nPeplink SpeedFusion technology allows for the bonding of multiple internet connections to provide a combined bandwidth, enhancing throughput and redundancy. It utilizes built-in VPN technology to achieve this, differentiating it from simple load balancing. To implement SpeedFusion, both ends of the connection must utilize Peplink devices, as SpeedFusion requires compatible hardware to function effectively. The proposed setup involves using a Peplink 710 in the main office with multiple ADSL connections and a Peplink Balance 20 at home or branch offices to achieve increased download speeds through bonded connections.\n\n## Document_9\n\nTo achieve a reliable and fast connection using multiple ADSL WAN connections, SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding requires two Peplink devices and is supported in Balance models 210, 310, and above. However, Internet Link Load Balancing can be achieved with the existing setup without the need for SpeedFusion. MediaFast is a feature of certain Balance routers that provides caching capabilities to enhance performance.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Peplink Balance router, when used in a stand-alone mode, provides session-based internet link load balancing with automatic failover, allowing it to combine the bandwidth of multiple internet connections for all network users. For achieving faster connections for single sessions or downloads, the SpeedFusion VPN technology is required to enable packet level bonding.\n\n## Document_11\n\nTo achieve faster internet speeds by combining multiple connections, a Peplink Balance 50 can be considered for bandwidth aggregation through internet Link Load Balancing. It is important to note that internet browsing speed is also dependent on the remote server and that session load balancing should function effectively. When using SpeedFusion for bonding WANs, factors such as bandwidth overhead for IPSEC/SpeedFusion and the actual point-to-point speeds between devices must be taken into account, as the available WAN speeds may not translate directly to bonded speeds due to various connection factors.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo achieve faster internet speeds using a Peplink Balance device, WAN load balancing (Aggregation) can be utilized to distribute internet traffic across multiple WAN connections. However, bonded WAN speed will only be effective for the ISP connected to the Balance device. SpeedFusion Bonding can combine all available WANs, but it requires consideration of additional bandwidth for rerouting traffic, especially if using a UK site. For optimal performance, a Balance 380 is recommended for the UK site with 2 x 100/20 Mbps connections, while a Balance 210 is suggested for the user's site with 1 x 13/1 Mbps and 1 x 10/0.5 Mbps connections. It's important to note that SpeedFusion Bonding may not significantly assist with tasks requiring high upload speeds, such as backing up large data collections to the cloud.\n\n## Document_13\n\nPeplink Balance can aggregate links between different ISPs using SpeedFusion, provided certain bonding requirements are met: latency for each link must be lower than 1000ms, the difference in latency between links must be less than 150ms, and the slowest WAN link must have at least 15% of the bandwidth of the fastest WAN link. In scenarios with MPLS and point-to-point lines, the expected throughput can be approximately 4.8 Mbps when aggregating a 4 Mbps and a 2 Mbps link, while aggregating a 4 Mbps, 2 Mbps, and 4 Mbps link can yield around 8 Mbps throughput, accounting for overhead.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo achieve true line bonding for merging three internet lines, SpeedFusion technology is required, which necessitates two SpeedFusion capable devices like a Balance 310 at each end. Alternatively, load balancing can distribute traffic from multiple simultaneous network boots across different WANs, allowing each session to be routed through a single WAN, thus maintaining one public IP per session. While load balancing will not increase the speed of a single boot, it can enhance the overall performance by allowing multiple boots to load faster.\n\n## Document_15\n\nPeplink Balance can be used instead of traditional switches for connecting multiple sites and achieving redundancy, link bonding, and protocol-specific routing. The SpeedFusion Bonding Technology allows for redundancy between links and can effectively double the bandwidth by bonding multiple links. Additionally, Peplink's proprietary protocol enables the advertisement of LAN segments to remote peers, facilitating protocol-specific routing over particular links.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo achieve a combined speed of 35 MB when transferring large files between two locations using Peplink devices, a Peplink Balance 380 must be paired with another Peplink device at the opposite location, and a SpeedFusion VPN must be established between them. This setup allows for the bonding of multiple internet connections to utilize their combined bandwidth effectively.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo achieve bonded connectivity that combines the speeds of multiple WAN connections on a single PC, SpeedFusion technology is required, as load balancing alone will not accomplish this. The original poster's attempt to use load balancing with a Peplink Balance 30 to aggregate three WANs into one speed was misguided, as load balancing distributes traffic rather than bonding it.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Peplink Balance 30 does not automatically bond multiple WAN connections to aggregate their speeds into a single connection. Instead, it utilizes load balancing, which allows for improved download speeds by distributing traffic across the available WANs. Users can achieve better performance by ensuring proper configuration of load balancing settings and testing with different servers. For true bonding of WAN connections, additional configurations such as using a cloud server with VPN protocols like PPTP or OpenVPN may be necessary, but this approach can be complex and may not guarantee reliability compared to using the Peplink's built-in features.\n\n## Document_19\n\nPeplink devices provide session-based load balancing, meaning each session will utilize one WAN connection, resulting in a maximum of 10 Mbps per session. However, with multiple sessions, the total bandwidth can reach 30 Mbps across different sessions. To overcome the session-based limitation, SpeedFusion bonding technology can be used, which combines multiple IP links into a single connection, increasing bandwidth and reliability. Recommended models for this setup include the Peplink Balance 30, 310, and 380, with the Balance 380 suggested for environments with many users due to its user group bandwidth control feature.\n\n## Document_20\n\nFor bonding multiple internet connections, the Peplink Balance 310X is recommended for its 2.5Gbps total throughput and 600Mbps SpeedFusion capability, suitable for high bandwidth needs. Alternatively, the Balance 20X can provide 900Mbps throughput and 100Mbps SpeedFusion, which may suffice for users needing reliable bonded bandwidth at a lower capacity. The Balance 20X also includes an inbuilt CAT4 LTE modem, potentially eliminating the need for an additional USB ethernet dongle for connecting an LTE router.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo achieve true bonding and increased download speeds by combining multiple connections on a Peplink device, SpeedFusion technology is required, which can be implemented through a FusionHub or another Peplink device. The SpeedFusion dynamic link bonding has an overhead of 18 to 30%, meaning that even with two 500 Mbps connections, the combined speed will not exceed 800 Mbps. Currently, the Peplink SDX can only perform load balancing without SpeedFusion, and users are advised to consult their Peplink partner or forums for optimization guidance.\n\n## Document_22\n\nPeplink's products enable simultaneous use of multiple internet connections, enhancing reliability and flexibility for users, particularly in mobile environments. Many customers utilize a multi-modem solution, often combining cellular connections from different carriers, which allows for seamless switching without significant downtime. The SpeedFusion technology, also known as SD-WAN or bonding, allows multiple connections to be used simultaneously by creating a secure tunnel to a data center, enabling redundancy and improved reliability. This technology simplifies the setup process, allowing users to establish SD-WAN capabilities without extensive technical knowledge or high costs typically associated with traditional solutions. Users can easily manage their connections and prioritize traffic based on their needs, ensuring consistent performance during critical tasks such as video conferencing.\n\n## Document_23\n\nPeplink routers offer multiple internet connection options, allowing users to combine various sources such as cellular modems, Ethernet ports, and Wi-Fi for enhanced connectivity. Models like the Max BR2 can support up to five different WAN sources simultaneously. Load balancing distributes traffic across available connections, while failover automatically switches to a backup connection if the primary fails. SpeedFusion is a proprietary SD-WAN technology that creates a VPN tunnel to combine multiple connections for improved reliability and performance. Additionally, WAN smoothing duplicates data across connections to ensure redundancy, although it consumes double the bandwidth. These features enable users to optimize their internet performance based on their specific needs and locations.\n\n## Document_24\n\nTo combine a DSL fiber connection with a cable connection for increased bandwidth, SpeedFusion technology can be utilized, specifically with a FusionHub for optimal performance. It is important to ensure that both connections have low latency and minimal packet loss for effective bonding. The hardware required to achieve gigabit speeds will need to be robust, and users should check the SpeedFusion encrypted throughput specifications on the Peplink Balance routers to ensure they meet the necessary performance requirements.\n\n## Document_25\n\nSpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding can be used to combine the bandwidth of multiple WAN links, allowing one device behind the Peplink router to utilize the combined bandwidth of both connections, minus the bonding overhead. This technology can effectively increase overall throughput, as demonstrated by a user who combined two 15/1 DSL links to achieve a 25/1.5 connection, resulting in a noticeable improvement in performance.\n\n## Document_26\n\nTo combine a fiber DSL connection with a cable connection at packet level, a Peplink multi-WAN Balance router with a SpeedFusion license is necessary. This setup allows for channel bonding, effectively increasing download and upload speeds by aggregating the bandwidth from both connections. It is important to ensure that the SpeedFusion license is included with the router or accounted for in the overall cost, as it can be expensive if purchased separately. Additionally, the router should be compatible with the existing network setup to avoid issues like double NAT, which can affect device connectivity and security.\n\n## Document_27\n\nTo combine a DSL fiber connection with a cable connection for improved overall internet speeds, a combination of load balancing and SpeedFusion technology can be utilized. SpeedFusion allows for the creation of a more reliable connection by aggregating bandwidth from multiple WAN sources. However, it is important to account for overhead, which can reduce effective speeds; for example, a combined upload speed of 140 Mbps may yield around 110 Mbps after accounting for overhead, and a combined download speed of 1000 Mbps may yield around 800 Mbps. Devices requiring a stable connection can be prioritized over SpeedFusion, while other devices can be connected directly to the gigabit WAN to avoid impacting SpeedFusion throughput.\n\n## Document_28\n\nTo combine a DSL fiber connection with a cable connection for increased bandwidth, a Pepwave router capable of channel bonding is needed. The goal is to achieve a combined speed of approximately 1 Gbps download and 140 Mbps upload without creating a double NAT situation, allowing the Google WiFi system to remain the DHCP handler. The user is looking for a non-WiFi Pepwave device that can handle high throughput, as residential-grade devices typically offer lower speeds.\n\n## Document_29\n\nTo combine multiple internet connections effectively, one can use load balancing or bonding techniques. Load balancing allows for distributing traffic across multiple WAN connections, while bonding treats them as a single connection for applications. The feasibility of bonding depends on the reliability of the connections; if one connection is prone to outages, bonding may be more beneficial. Pepwave devices can facilitate these functions, but the user should consider the cost versus the reliability of their connections before investing in bonding technology.\n\n## Document_30\n\nTo achieve channel bonding of a fiber DSL connection (100 Mbps up/down) with a cable connection (940 Mbps down/40 Mbps up) using Pepwave products, a non-WiFi Pepwave router capable of true packet-level bonding is required. This setup should allow for the combined throughput of both connections without creating a double NAT situation, ensuring that the Google WiFi system remains the DHCP handler. The router must support sufficient throughput to handle the combined speeds, ideally exceeding 1 Gbps for optimal performance.\n\n## Document_31\n\nTo combine a fiber DSL connection of 100 Mbps with a cable connection of 940 Mbps for a total speed of 1 Gbps or more, a Pepwave device capable of packet-level bonding is required. The user seeks a non-WiFi Pepwave router that can achieve this without creating a double NAT situation, allowing their Google WiFi system to remain the DHCP handler. The user is also concerned about throughput, noting that residential-grade Pepwave devices typically offer lower speeds, which may not meet their requirements.\n\n## Document_32\n\nTo combine multiple internet connections effectively, SpeedFusion bonding is required, which allows for the aggregation of bandwidth from different sources. This technology can be used to merge a cable connection with a gigabit download speed and a fiber connection with 100 Mbps download and upload speeds, resulting in a combined throughput that enhances overall internet performance. It is important to ensure that the setup does not create a double NAT situation, which could interfere with network functionality, especially for devices like security cameras and backup servers.\n\n## Document_33\n\nTo combine a fiber DSL connection with a cable connection for increased bandwidth, load balancing can be utilized for high bandwidth traffic, providing session level failover between WAN links. SpeedFusion should be reserved for real-time traffic sensitive to packet loss or latency, such as VoIP. Recommended devices for this setup include the Pepwave Balance Two or the SDX for future 5G integration.\n\n## Document_34\n\nTo combine a DSL fiber connection of 100 Mbps down and up with a cable connection of 940 Mbps down and 40 Mbps up, a Pepwave router that supports load balancing can be used. This setup allows for packet-level distribution of traffic, effectively increasing overall throughput. However, it is important to configure the Pepwave device to avoid handling DHCP requests to maintain the roaming capabilities of a Google mesh Wi-Fi system. Each Google mesh point is hardwired back to a switch, ensuring that they do not rely on wireless connections to each other, which is beneficial for performance.\n\n## Document_35\n\nUsing two Peplink MAX BR1 PRO routers in series can achieve effective load balancing. The first router (BR1#1) can balance its two WAN connections (one ethernet and one cellular) using outbound policies for session-level balancing. To enhance performance, a SpeedFusion connection can be established, allowing for packet-level balancing. If the second router (BR1#2) is also utilized with both its cellular and wired WAN options, it can provide additional connections for balancing. This setup allows for a combination of weighted balancing across multiple WANs, optimizing internet connectivity.\n\n",

      "The Peplink Balance 20 can utilize two WAN connections simultaneously and load balance between them using various algorithms. However, this does not equate to bonding in the sense of providing a single connection that combines the speeds of both WANs. For instance, if WAN1 has a speed of 80Mbps and WAN2 has 30Mbps, a single client will be limited to the speed of the faster WAN (80Mbps) unless a more complex bonding solution is implemented to allow the client to utilize the combined speed of both connections (110Mbps).",
      "To combine two high-speed internet connections effectively, such as a fiber DSL line and a cable connection, bonding is necessary to create a virtual single pipe that aggregates the bandwidth of both connections. The Peplink Balance 2500 and the EPX modular chassis with appropriate expansion cards are capable of supporting over 800Mbps of bonded throughput. However, bonding can be expensive and requires a separate connection point to the internet. Alternatively, Peplink devices can utilize outbound policy for WAN load balancing, allowing for balanced use of both WAN connections for outbound traffic, while inbound traffic would typically be directed to one WAN unless DNS configurations are employed to manage inbound traffic across both connections. This setup can provide failover capabilities, ensuring continuity if one connection fails.",

    "answer": "To achieve maximum aggregate bandwidth by combining a fiber DSL and a cable connection with Pepwave/Peplink products, the technician should use a non-WiFi Pepwave router capable of true packet-level bonding (SpeedFusion) and ensure that the router does not handle DHCP, allowing the Google WiFi system to maintain DHCP functionality and avoid double NAT. SpeedFusion bonding requires compatible devices at both ends (e.g., Peplink Balance models or FusionHub) and a valid SpeedFusion license. The router must support sufficient encrypted throughput to handle the combined speeds (ideally exceeding 1 Gbps for setups with 100 Mbps fiber and 940 Mbps cable). The connections should have low latency and minimal packet loss for effective bonding. Overhead from SpeedFusion (typically 18–30%) must be accounted for, so actual throughput will be somewhat less than the sum of both links. Proper configuration is needed to ensure Google WiFi mesh points remain hardwired and that the Pepwave router is transparent to DHCP requests. Residential-grade devices may not provide sufficient throughput; higher-end models or SDX/Balance Two are recommended. For real-time traffic, SpeedFusion should be prioritized, while other traffic can use load balancing to optimize bandwidth and reliability.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nTo combine two high-speed internet connections effectively, such as a fiber DSL line and a cable connection, bonding is necessary to create a virtual single pipe that aggregates the bandwidth of both connections. The Peplink Balance 2500 and the EPX modular chassis with appropriate expansion cards are capable of supporting over 800Mbps of bonded throughput. However, bonding can be expensive and requires a separate connection point to the internet. Alternatively, Peplink devices can utilize outbound policy for WAN load balancing, allowing for balanced use of both WAN connections for outbound traffic, while inbound traffic would typically be directed to one WAN unless DNS configurations are employed to manage inbound traffic across both connections. This setup can provide failover capabilities, ensuring continuity if one connection fails.\n\n## Document_2\n\nTo combine two internet connections (DSL and Cable) for load balancing, a Peplink Balance 20 or 30 can be used. These devices can also be configured for failover, allowing one connection to remain active while the other is used only when the primary fails. Traffic prioritization for specific IPs is possible, and remote management is supported. For wireless access points, the AP One can work with the Balance 30 or 310, but it is important to check compatibility and setup individually. The APs operate in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, which can help mitigate interference issues in environments with congested 2.4 GHz bands.\n\n## Document_3\n\nPeplink devices can perform link aggregation or bonding, but this requires setting up a Site-to-Site VPN between two Peplink Balance models 210 or higher; the Balance 30 does not support aggregation. In a typical load balancing scenario, the Peplink Balance utilizes all available WAN connections to optimize bandwidth usage, particularly beneficial in multi-user environments. However, for single-user sessions, the speed is limited to the WAN link being used. Once a Site-to-Site VPN is established, the VPN treats all WAN connections as a single large pipe, allowing traffic to be distributed across all links, which can improve performance.\n\n## Document_4\n\nTo combine signals from two different ISPs, such as a T1 with a static IP and a cable connection using DHCP, a Peplink Balance 20 or 210 can be used. For future scalability, a Balancer unit with 3 or 5 WAN ports is recommended. Considerations for selecting the appropriate product include total bandwidth, number of concurrent users, and the need for features like inbound load balancing and bandwidth management per IP.\n\n## Document_5\n\nTo implement a better internet service in a poorly serviced area using Peplink products, it is possible to use bandwidth bonding technology. A Peplink Balance 210 or above is required at the client end to bond multiple ADSL connections into a single internet pipe, achieving a maximum upstream of 2.5Mbps and downstream of 11Mbps. For the data center, a Peplink Balance 1350 is recommended, which supports a bonded throughput of 350Mbps, suitable for a high-speed fiber connection of 200Mbps throughput.\n\n## Document_6\n\nFor a setup involving a primary fiber internet connection and a backup cable internet connection, the Peplink Balance Two is recommended as it offers two Gigabit WAN ports. This allows for prioritization of WAN connections, enabling one to become active if the other goes down, or for load balancing to utilize both connections simultaneously. SpeedFusion bonding is an option but requires an additional license, which may not be necessary for this particular setup.\n\n## Document_7\n\nFor a reliable home office setup with two fiber connections and an LTE backup, a Peplink Balance 20X or Balance Two are recommended options. The Balance 20X can achieve a throughput of 900Mbps and requires a USB-Ethernet dongle for the second wired WAN connection, while the Balance Two supports two full-speed wired WAN ports with a total throughput of 1Gbps. Both setups can utilize a USB modem dongle for LTE fallback. It is advisable to contact a local Peplink partner for tailored advice and to ensure compatibility with specific requirements.\n\n## Document_8\n\nFor a home office focused on live streaming, a dual WAN Peplink router such as the Balance 20 or Balance 30-LTE is recommended for seamless hot failover with a single IP. Activating the bonding license allows two fiber connections to function as one, but it is crucial that the bonded WAN connections have similar speeds to avoid performance issues. Peplink's SpeedFusion technology ensures that during WAN failure, ongoing calls or streams do not drop, even without bonding.\n\n## Document_9\n\nWhen bonding multiple internet connections using Peplink devices, slower connections can significantly reduce the overall upload speed of the bonded link. In a scenario where a Peplink Balance 380 is used with a Pepwave Max 700, the user experiences upload speeds below 1 Mbit/s when bonding five connections, despite some connections being faster individually. This issue is compounded by the variability of connection speeds in different locations, making it difficult to determine which connections to remove for optimal performance. Additionally, another user notes that in their experience with Peplink products, they do not observe bandwidth aggregation benefits when using multiple connections, suggesting that a single, faster link may perform better than multiple slower ones.\n\n## Document_10\n\nPeplink SpeedFusion technology allows for the bonding of multiple internet connections to provide a combined bandwidth, enhancing throughput and redundancy. It utilizes built-in VPN technology to achieve this, differentiating it from simple load balancing. To implement SpeedFusion, both ends of the connection must utilize Peplink devices, as SpeedFusion requires compatible hardware to function effectively. The proposed setup involves using a Peplink 710 in the main office with multiple ADSL connections and a Peplink Balance 20 at home or branch offices to achieve increased download speeds through bonded connections.\n\n## Document_11\n\nFor bonding 4 ADSL WAN lines with a Pepwave Balance 50, it is suggested that a Balance One with a SpeedFusion license or models 210, 380, and above may be necessary, as the Balance 50 may not support SpeedFusion. If the LAN configuration involves a large number of devices, particularly with subnets of the sizes mentioned (10.73.10.0/23 and 10.84.0.0/16), a more powerful model such as the Balance 710 or above is recommended to handle the traffic and VPN requirements effectively. For networks with up to 100 devices, a Balance One with SpeedFusion may suffice, but for 100-400 devices, a Balance 580 or Balance 710 is advised for better performance.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo achieve a reliable and fast connection using multiple ADSL WAN connections, SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding requires two Peplink devices and is supported in Balance models 210, 310, and above. However, Internet Link Load Balancing can be achieved with the existing setup without the need for SpeedFusion. MediaFast is a feature of certain Balance routers that provides caching capabilities to enhance performance.\n\n## Document_13\n\nTo achieve a reliable and fast connection by bonding three ADSL WAN connections, a Peplink Balance device with SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding is recommended. SpeedFusion allows for the bonding of multiple WAN connections to create a single, faster connection for internet use, including web, VoIP, and Skype. The Balance 50 does not support SpeedFusion, which means it cannot perform bandwidth bonding. For testing SpeedFusion, FusionHub can be used as a software-only solution. When using SpeedFusion, it is possible to bond connections from multiple WAN providers and send the combined bandwidth to the internet, provided that the remote VPS has sufficient bandwidth. The best operating system for a VPS running SpeedFusion is not specified, but it is implied that SpeedFusion may not require a traditional operating system. For local setups, a server with multiple Ethernet ports is needed to connect the WANs and provide a single LAN output, and the best operating system for such a server is not detailed.\n\n## Document_14\n\nFor achieving a reliable and fast connection by bonding multiple ADSL WAN connections, the Peplink Balance series is recommended, particularly models that support SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding. The Balance 50 has 5 WAN ports but does not support SpeedFusion, which means it cannot perform bandwidth bonding. The cheapest Balance router with WAN bonding capability should be identified based on specific needs. Additionally, the MediaFast capability enhances performance for specific applications, but details on its functionality were not provided in the conversation.\n\n## Document_15\n\nTo maximize internet connections using SpeedFusion, a user can consider a Peplink Balance 310 with a FusionHub license on AWS. For bonding, at least one device should be a Peplink Balance 201 or 301, while a Balance ONE Core may be sufficient for both ends in some cases. When SpeedFusion bonding is set up between two users, one with a 100/40Mbps fiber connection and another with 36/2.5Mbps from three ISPs, the expected internet speed will depend on the bonding configuration and the capabilities of the devices used.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo maximize the use of multiple internet connections with Peplink devices, one option is to implement SpeedFusion using a Balance 310 along with FusionHub on AWS. The specific FusionHub license required and the associated AWS costs need to be clarified. Alternatively, SpeedFusion can be set up between two SpeedFusion-ready devices, which could involve a Peplink model at each location, such as one in rural Thailand and another in the UK with faster fiber connections. The exact models needed for this setup should be determined based on the specific requirements.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo achieve faster internet speeds by combining multiple connections, a Peplink Balance 50 can be considered for bandwidth aggregation through internet Link Load Balancing. It is important to note that internet browsing speed is also dependent on the remote server and that session load balancing should function effectively. When using SpeedFusion for bonding WANs, factors such as bandwidth overhead for IPSEC/SpeedFusion and the actual point-to-point speeds between devices must be taken into account, as the available WAN speeds may not translate directly to bonded speeds due to various connection factors.\n\n## Document_18\n\nTo achieve faster internet speeds using a Peplink Balance device, WAN load balancing (Aggregation) can be utilized to distribute internet traffic across multiple WAN connections. However, bonded WAN speed will only be effective for the ISP connected to the Balance device. SpeedFusion Bonding can combine all available WANs, but it requires consideration of additional bandwidth for rerouting traffic, especially if using a UK site. For optimal performance, a Balance 380 is recommended for the UK site with 2 x 100/20 Mbps connections, while a Balance 210 is suggested for the user's site with 1 x 13/1 Mbps and 1 x 10/0.5 Mbps connections. It's important to note that SpeedFusion Bonding may not significantly assist with tasks requiring high upload speeds, such as backing up large data collections to the cloud.\n\n## Document_19\n\nPeplink Balance can aggregate links between different ISPs using SpeedFusion, provided certain bonding requirements are met: latency for each link must be lower than 1000ms, the difference in latency between links must be less than 150ms, and the slowest WAN link must have at least 15% of the bandwidth of the fastest WAN link. In scenarios with MPLS and point-to-point lines, the expected throughput can be approximately 4.8 Mbps when aggregating a 4 Mbps and a 2 Mbps link, while aggregating a 4 Mbps, 2 Mbps, and 4 Mbps link can yield around 8 Mbps throughput, accounting for overhead.\n\n## Document_20\n\nIn a setup where a Peplink Balance 210 is used at the Main Office with two ADSL connections (10Mbps downstream and 1Mbps upstream each) and a Peplink Balance 20 is used at the Branch Office with a single ADSL connection (10Mbps downstream and 1Mbps upstream), SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding can still be utilized. The upload capacity from the Main Office to the Branch Office would be 2Mbps, while the upload from the Branch Office to the Main Office would be 1Mbps, accounting for overhead.\n\n## Document_21\n\nThe Peplink Balance 30 does not automatically bond multiple WAN connections to aggregate their speeds into a single connection. Instead, it utilizes load balancing, which allows for improved download speeds by distributing traffic across the available WANs. Users can achieve better performance by ensuring proper configuration of load balancing settings and testing with different servers. For true bonding of WAN connections, additional configurations such as using a cloud server with VPN protocols like PPTP or OpenVPN may be necessary, but this approach can be complex and may not guarantee reliability compared to using the Peplink's built-in features.\n\n## Document_22\n\nTo combine multiple DSL connections for greater upload speed using Peplink devices, a Balance 210 model or higher is required on each side of a SpeedFusion VPN to bond the WAN links into one aggregate connection.\n\n## Document_23\n\nPeplink devices provide session-based load balancing, meaning each session will utilize one WAN connection, resulting in a maximum of 10 Mbps per session. However, with multiple sessions, the total bandwidth can reach 30 Mbps across different sessions. To overcome the session-based limitation, SpeedFusion bonding technology can be used, which combines multiple IP links into a single connection, increasing bandwidth and reliability. Recommended models for this setup include the Peplink Balance 30, 310, and 380, with the Balance 380 suggested for environments with many users due to its user group bandwidth control feature.\n\n## Document_24\n\nIt is possible to connect a Peplink device running SpeedFusion at Site A to FusionHub on AWS for internet access. FusionHub can be installed on virtual machines and allows for SpeedFusion connections with Peplink devices, including the Balance model. This setup enables the bonding of multiple WAN connections on the Peplink device to provide a faster internet connection.\n\n## Document_25\n\nFor bonding multiple internet connections, the Peplink Balance 310X is recommended for its 2.5Gbps total throughput and 600Mbps SpeedFusion capability, suitable for high bandwidth needs. Alternatively, the Balance 20X can provide 900Mbps throughput and 100Mbps SpeedFusion, which may suffice for users needing reliable bonded bandwidth at a lower capacity. The Balance 20X also includes an inbuilt CAT4 LTE modem, potentially eliminating the need for an additional USB ethernet dongle for connecting an LTE router.\n\n## Document_26\n\nTo combine a DSL fiber connection with a cable connection for increased bandwidth, SpeedFusion technology can be utilized, specifically with a FusionHub for optimal performance. It is important to ensure that both connections have low latency and minimal packet loss for effective bonding. The hardware required to achieve gigabit speeds will need to be robust, and users should check the SpeedFusion encrypted throughput specifications on the Peplink Balance routers to ensure they meet the necessary performance requirements.\n\n## Document_27\n\nSpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding can be used to combine the bandwidth of multiple WAN links, allowing one device behind the Peplink router to utilize the combined bandwidth of both connections, minus the bonding overhead. This technology can effectively increase overall throughput, as demonstrated by a user who combined two 15/1 DSL links to achieve a 25/1.5 connection, resulting in a noticeable improvement in performance.\n\n## Document_28\n\nTo combine a fiber DSL connection with a cable connection at packet level, a Peplink multi-WAN Balance router with a SpeedFusion license is necessary. This setup allows for channel bonding, effectively increasing download and upload speeds by aggregating the bandwidth from both connections. It is important to ensure that the SpeedFusion license is included with the router or accounted for in the overall cost, as it can be expensive if purchased separately. Additionally, the router should be compatible with the existing network setup to avoid issues like double NAT, which can affect device connectivity and security.\n\n## Document_29\n\nTo combine a DSL fiber connection with a cable connection for improved overall internet speeds, a combination of load balancing and SpeedFusion technology can be utilized. SpeedFusion allows for the creation of a more reliable connection by aggregating bandwidth from multiple WAN sources. However, it is important to account for overhead, which can reduce effective speeds; for example, a combined upload speed of 140 Mbps may yield around 110 Mbps after accounting for overhead, and a combined download speed of 1000 Mbps may yield around 800 Mbps. Devices requiring a stable connection can be prioritized over SpeedFusion, while other devices can be connected directly to the gigabit WAN to avoid impacting SpeedFusion throughput.\n\n## Document_30\n\nTo combine a DSL fiber connection with a cable connection for increased bandwidth, a Pepwave router capable of channel bonding is needed. The goal is to achieve a combined speed of approximately 1 Gbps download and 140 Mbps upload without creating a double NAT situation, allowing the Google WiFi system to remain the DHCP handler. The user is looking for a non-WiFi Pepwave device that can handle high throughput, as residential-grade devices typically offer lower speeds.\n\n## Document_31\n\nTo combine multiple internet connections effectively, one can use load balancing or bonding techniques. Load balancing allows for distributing traffic across multiple WAN connections, while bonding treats them as a single connection for applications. The feasibility of bonding depends on the reliability of the connections; if one connection is prone to outages, bonding may be more beneficial. Pepwave devices can facilitate these functions, but the user should consider the cost versus the reliability of their connections before investing in bonding technology.\n\n## Document_32\n\nTo achieve channel bonding of a fiber DSL connection (100 Mbps up/down) with a cable connection (940 Mbps down/40 Mbps up) using Pepwave products, a non-WiFi Pepwave router capable of true packet-level bonding is required. This setup should allow for the combined throughput of both connections without creating a double NAT situation, ensuring that the Google WiFi system remains the DHCP handler. The router must support sufficient throughput to handle the combined speeds, ideally exceeding 1 Gbps for optimal performance.\n\n## Document_33\n\nTo combine a fiber DSL connection of 100 Mbps with a cable connection of 940 Mbps for a total speed of 1 Gbps or more, a Pepwave device capable of packet-level bonding is required. The user seeks a non-WiFi Pepwave router that can achieve this without creating a double NAT situation, allowing their Google WiFi system to remain the DHCP handler. The user is also concerned about throughput, noting that residential-grade Pepwave devices typically offer lower speeds, which may not meet their requirements.\n\n## Document_34\n\nTo combine multiple internet connections effectively, SpeedFusion bonding is required, which allows for the aggregation of bandwidth from different sources. This technology can be used to merge a cable connection with a gigabit download speed and a fiber connection with 100 Mbps download and upload speeds, resulting in a combined throughput that enhances overall internet performance.

      "To combine two high-speed internet connections effectively, such as a fiber DSL line and a cable connection, bonding is necessary to create a virtual single pipe that aggregates the bandwidth of both connections. The Peplink Balance 2500 and the EPX modular chassis with appropriate expansion cards are capable of supporting over 800Mbps of bonded throughput. However, bonding can be expensive and requires a separate connection point to the internet. Alternatively, Peplink devices can utilize outbound policy for WAN load balancing, allowing for balanced use of both WAN connections for outbound traffic, while inbound traffic would typically be directed to one WAN unless DNS configurations are employed to manage inbound traffic across both connections. This setup can provide failover capabilities, ensuring continuity if one connection fails.",
      "To combine two internet connections (DSL and Cable) for load balancing, a Peplink Balance 20 or 30 can be used. These devices can also be configured for failover, allowing one connection to remain active while the other is used only when the primary fails. Traffic prioritization for specific IPs is possible, and remote management is supported. For wireless access points, the AP One can work with the Balance 30 or 310, but it is important to check compatibility and setup individually. The APs operate in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, which can help mitigate interference issues in environments with congested 2.4 GHz bands.",
      "Peplink devices can perform link aggregation or bonding, but this requires setting up a Site-to-Site VPN between two Peplink Balance models 210 or higher; the Balance 30 does not support aggregation. In a typical load balancing scenario, the Peplink Balance utilizes all available WAN connections to optimize bandwidth usage, particularly beneficial in multi-user environments. However, for single-user sessions, the speed is limited to the WAN link being used. Once a Site-to-Site VPN is established, the VPN treats all WAN connections as a single large pipe, allowing traffic to be distributed across all links, which can improve performance.",
      "To combine signals from two different ISPs, such as a T1 with a static IP and a cable connection using DHCP, a Peplink Balance 20 or 210 can be used. For future scalability, a Balancer unit with 3 or 5 WAN ports is recommended. Considerations for selecting the appropriate product include total bandwidth, number of concurrent users, and the need for features like inbound load balancing and bandwidth management per IP.",
      "To implement a better internet service in a poorly serviced area using Peplink products, it is possible to use bandwidth bonding technology. A Peplink Balance 210 or above is required at the client end to bond multiple ADSL connections into a single internet pipe, achieving a maximum upstream of 2.5Mbps and downstream of 11Mbps. For the data center, a Peplink Balance 1350 is recommended, which supports a bonded throughput of 350Mbps, suitable for a high-speed fiber connection of 200Mbps throughput.",
      "For a setup involving a primary fiber internet connection and a backup cable internet connection, the Peplink Balance Two is recommended as it offers two Gigabit WAN ports.

The proposed setup involves using a Peplink 710 in the main office with multiple ADSL connections and a Peplink Balance 20 at home or branch offices to achieve increased download speeds through bonded connections.",
      "For bonding 4 ADSL WAN lines with a Pepwave Balance 50, it is suggested that a Balance One with a SpeedFusion license or models 210, 380, and above may be necessary, as the Balance 50 may not support SpeedFusion. If the LAN configuration involves a large number of devices, particularly with subnets of the sizes mentioned (10.73.10.0/23 and 10.84.0.0/16), a more powerful model such as the Balance 710 or above is recommended to handle the traffic and VPN requirements effectively. For networks with up to 100 devices, a Balance One with SpeedFusion may suffice, but for 100-400 devices, a Balance 580 or Balance 710 is advised for better performance.",
      "To achieve a reliable and fast connection using multiple ADSL WAN connections, SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding requires two Peplink devices and is supported in Balance models 210, 310, and above. However, Internet Link Load Balancing can be achieved with the existing setup without the need for SpeedFusion. MediaFast is a feature of certain Balance routers that provides caching capabilities to enhance performance.",
      "To achieve a reliable and fast connection by bonding three ADSL WAN connections, a Peplink Balance device with SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding is recommended. SpeedFusion allows for the bonding of multiple WAN connections to create a single, faster connection for internet use, including web, VoIP, and Skype. The Balance 50 does not support SpeedFusion, which means it cannot perform bandwidth bonding. For testing SpeedFusion, FusionHub can be used as a software-only solution. When using SpeedFusion, it is possible to bond connections from multiple WAN providers and send the combined bandwidth to the internet, provided that the remote VPS has sufficient bandwidth. The best operating system for a VPS running SpeedFusion is not specified, but it is implied that SpeedFusion may not require a traditional operating system. For local setups, a server with multiple Ethernet ports is needed to connect the WANs and provide a single LAN output, and the best operating system for such a server is not detailed.",

The Balance 50 has 5 WAN ports but does not support SpeedFusion, which means it cannot perform bandwidth bonding. The cheapest Balance router with WAN bonding capability should be identified based on specific needs. Additionally, the MediaFast capability enhances performance for specific applications, but details on its functionality were not provided in the conversation.",
      "To maximize internet connections using SpeedFusion, a user can consider a Peplink Balance 310 with a FusionHub license on AWS. For bonding, at least one device should be a Peplink Balance 201 or 301, while a Balance ONE Core may be sufficient for both ends in some cases. When SpeedFusion bonding is set up between two users, one with a 100/40Mbps fiber connection and another with 36/2.5Mbps from three ISPs, the expected internet speed will depend on the bonding configuration and the capabilities of the devices used.",
      "To maximize the use of multiple internet connections with Peplink devices, one option is to implement SpeedFusion using a Balance 310 along with FusionHub on AWS. The specific FusionHub license required and the associated AWS costs need to be clarified. Alternatively, SpeedFusion can be set up between two SpeedFusion-ready devices, which could involve a Peplink model at each location, such as one in rural Thailand and another in the UK with faster fiber connections. The exact models needed for this setup should be determined based on the specific requirements.",
      "To achieve faster internet speeds by combining multiple connections, a Peplink Balance 50 can be considered for bandwidth aggregation through internet Link Load Balancing. It is important to note that internet browsing speed is also dependent on the remote server and that session load balancing should function effectively. When using SpeedFusion for bonding WANs, factors such as bandwidth overhead for IPSEC/SpeedFusion and the actual point-to-point speeds between devices must be taken into account, as the available WAN speeds may not translate directly to bonded speeds due to various connection factors.",
      "To achieve faster internet speeds using a Peplink Balance device, WAN load balancing (Aggregation) can be utilized to distribute internet traffic across multiple WAN connections. However, bonded WAN speed will only be effective for the ISP connected to the Balance device. SpeedFusion Bonding can combine all available WANs, but it requires consideration of additional bandwidth for rerouting traffic, especially if using a UK site. For optimal performance, a Balance 380 is recommended for the UK site with 2 x 100/20 Mbps connections, while a Balance 210 is suggested for the user's site with 1 x 13/1 Mbps and 1 x 10/0.5 Mbps connections. It's important to note that SpeedFusion Bonding may not significantly assist with tasks requiring high upload speeds, such as backing up large data collections to the cloud.",
      "Peplink Balance can aggregate links between different ISPs using SpeedFusion, provided certain bonding requirements are met: latency for each link must be lower than 1000ms, the difference in latency between links must be less than 150ms, and the slowest WAN link must have at least 15% of the bandwidth of the fastest WAN link. In scenarios with MPLS and point-to-point lines, the expected throughput can be approximately 4.8 Mbps when aggregating a 4 Mbps and a 2 Mbps link, while aggregating a 4 Mbps, 2 Mbps, and 4 Mbps link can yield around 8 Mbps throughput, accounting for overhead.",

    "query": "For a user wanting to combine a 100 Mbps fiber DSL connection and a 940 Mbps cable connection into a single high-throughput, packet-level bonded link (with at least 1 Gbps combined throughput), while avoiding double NAT and allowing Google WiFi to remain the DHCP handler, what Pepwave/Peplink router models and configuration considerations are required, and what technical limitations or performance caveats should be expected?",
    "answer": "To combine a 100 Mbps fiber DSL and a 940 Mbps cable connection into a single high-throughput packet-level bonded link, you need a Pepwave/Peplink router that supports SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding and has sufficient throughput capabilities (ideally exceeding 1 Gbps). Suitable models include high-end devices like the Peplink Balance 310X (2.5 Gbps total, 600 Mbps SpeedFusion), Balance Two (1 Gbps total, 150 Mbps SpeedFusion), or modular SDX/EPX chassis for even higher performance. SpeedFusion technology will aggregate both WANs at the packet level, but you must ensure the router's SpeedFusion throughput matches your combined bandwidth needs. For optimal performance, both WANs should have similar latency and minimal packet loss; significant speed or latency mismatches can reduce effective throughput. To avoid double NAT and allow Google WiFi to handle DHCP, configure the Pepwave router in a way that passes the public IP (e.g., bridge mode or DMZ), and do not let it act as the DHCP server. Note that some residential-grade devices may not achieve the required throughput, and SpeedFusion bonding introduces overhead, so actual usable bandwidth may be less than the sum of both links.

    "query": "How can adding a slower or higher-latency WAN connection (such as a WISP) to a Peplink SpeedFusion-bonded setup with a faster connection (such as Verizon) negatively impact overall throughput, and what configuration adjustments can help mitigate this issue?",
    "answer": "When bonding a faster WAN connection (like Verizon cellular) with a slower or higher-latency WAN (like a WISP) using Peplink SpeedFusion, the overall throughput can decrease compared to using the faster connection alone. This is because SpeedFusion's bonding protocol distributes traffic across both links, and the slower or more jittery link can introduce delays or bottlenecks that reduce the effective combined speed. This effect is particularly evident if the WISP connection has higher latency or jitter, causing packets to arrive out of order or slower, which can throttle the performance of the entire bonded tunnel. Additionally, SpeedFusion bonding introduces overhead (typically around 18%), further reducing the maximum possible throughput. Configuration adjustments such as setting latency and packet loss cutoffs for the slower link can help by preventing it from being used when its performance degrades, thereby allowing the faster connection to carry more of the load. Properly tuning these parameters is crucial for optimal SpeedFusion performance, especially in areas with variable link quality.",

The second IPv6 address (2601:647:ce00:3cf9::bd06) is a global IPv6 address, which can be accessed by any device on the LAN or the internet.\n\n## Document_4\n\nRouting metrics are essential for determining the best route to remote networks, with common metrics including hop count, maximum transmission unit (MTU), bandwidth, latency, and administrative distance (AD). The hop count measures the number of routers between endpoints, while MTU defines the maximum packet size allowed. Bandwidth indicates connection speed, and latency measures the time taken for packets to traverse a network. Administrative distance ranks the trustworthiness of routing protocols, with lower values indicating higher trust. Route aggregation is a technique used to condense routing tables by summarizing contiguous routes, which requires careful planning to avoid noncontiguous networks. High availability techniques, such as Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) and Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), are employed to eliminate single points of failure in networks by using redundant links and shared virtual IP addresses. Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) like OSPF and RIP are used within autonomous networks, while Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs) like BGP operate between different organizations. Routing protocols can be categorized into distance vector, link state, and hybrid protocols based on their routing determination methods.\n\n## Document_5\n\nIPv6 is routable and supports both static and dynamic routing protocols, including an upgraded OSPF version three that accommodates IPv6 alongside IPv4. To configure static routes in IPv6, the IPv6 route command is used, with a prefix length of 128 bits for host routes and ::/0 for default routes. IPv6 routing tables are independent of IPv4. OSPF version three can be configured using two methods: the traditional method similar to OSPF version two and a newer method utilizing address families to support both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously. Configuration steps include enabling IPv6 Unicast routing, starting the OSPF process, and assigning interfaces to OSPF processes without using the network command. The configuration also allows for the advertisement of default routes in the IPv6 address family, while maintaining separate routing tables for IPv4 and IPv6.\n\n## Document_6\n\nIPv6 introduces new methods for assigning addresses to devices, including EUI-64 and Stateless Address Auto Configuration (SLAAC), alongside traditional manual and DHCP methods. IPv6 supports dual stack configurations, allowing both IPv4 and IPv6 to operate simultaneously. Link local addresses are automatically generated when IPv6 is enabled, using the EUI-64 method which incorporates the MAC address of the network card. Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) replaces ARP in IPv6, resolving IP addresses to MAC addresses and facilitating the discovery of routers and devices on the local network. NDP uses ICMPv6 messages for communication, including neighbor solicitation and advertisement messages. SLAAC allows devices to autonomously generate their own IP addresses based on router advertisements, making it stateless and eliminating the need for a centralized database of assigned IPs. The configuration of IPv6 addresses on routers involves using commands similar to those in IPv4, with the addition of CIDR notation for prefix lengths.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe video discusses the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) in IPv6, explaining how devices learn MAC addresses and detect IP conflicts through neighbor solicitation and advertisement messages. It introduces Stateless Address Auto Configuration (SLAAC), which allows devices to automatically configure their IP addresses without tracking assigned addresses, using router solicitation and advertisement messages to obtain prefixes. The client generates its own IP using the EUI-64 method. The video also covers the configuration of SLAAC on routers, including enabling IPv6 Unicast routing and suppressing router advertisement messages. Additionally, it explains the limitations of SLAAC regarding the lack of additional information like DNS servers, leading to the introduction of DHCPv6, which can be stateful or stateless. Stateful DHCP tracks leases and assigns IPs, while stateless DHCP works alongside SLAAC to provide additional configuration options. The video concludes with a lab exercise involving multiple routers to configure and troubleshoot IPv6 addressing.\n\n## Document_8\n\nIPv6 introduces several new address types including global unicast, local, and anycast addresses, aiming to eliminate the need for NAT and private IPs. Unlike IPv4, where NAT was essential due to limited public IPs, IPv6 allows all devices to have publicly routable addresses, although NAT technologies like NAT46 and NAT64 still exist for IPv4 to IPv6 translation. Link-local addresses, starting with 'fe80', are automatically assigned to interfaces for local communication and are not routable beyond the local network. Unique local addresses can be used within private networks but are not routable on the internet. IPv6 eliminates broadcast traffic, relying instead on multicast for similar functionality, and introduces anycast for load balancing across multiple devices. Subnetting in IPv6 is similar to IPv4, with common subnet sizes being /64, /56, or /48, allowing for efficient network design and allocation.\n\n## Document_9\n\nIPv6 addresses consist of eight groups of hexadecimal numbers separated by colons, contrasting with IPv4's four groups of decimal numbers separated by dots. Each hexadecimal group represents 16 bits, and leading zeros can be omitted for simplification. Consecutive groups of zeros can be compressed using a double colon, but only one such compression is allowed in an address. The standard prefix length for most subnets is /64, allowing approximately 18 quintillion addresses per subnet. IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long, and a /128 prefix indicates a host address, while /127 is used for point-to-point WAN links, allowing only two host addresses. The IPv6 header is larger than the IPv4 header but simpler, with fewer mandatory fields. The video also mentions various types of IPv6 addresses, including global unicast and local addresses.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe video discusses the evolution of Internet Protocol (IP), highlighting the separation of TCP and IP in 1977 and the subsequent adoption of TCP/IP as the standard for military networking in 1982. IPv4, which uses 32-bit addresses, supports approximately 4.2 billion unique addresses but is facing exhaustion due to the rapid growth of the internet and the increasing number of connected devices, including IoT devices. The introduction of NAT and CIDR helped extend the life of IPv4, but the long-term solution is IPv6, which utilizes 128-bit addresses, providing a vastly larger address space of 340 undecillion addresses. The video outlines the challenges of transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6, including the need for dual-stack configurations and the slow pace of adoption due to legacy applications and infrastructure. It also mentions enhancements in IPv6, such as the replacement of ARP with NDP, the introduction of DHCPv6 and DNSv6, and the elimination of broadcasts in favor of multicast messaging.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe video discusses the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses, noting that IANA allocated its last /8 block in January 2011, with various regional Internet registries (RIRs) exhausting their allocations in subsequent years. While IPv4 is not completely obsolete, its availability is severely limited, prompting a marketplace for buying and selling IP blocks. The long-term solution is IPv6, which offers a vastly larger address space and a different hexadecimal address format. IPv4 and IPv6 can coexist through dual stack configurations, facilitating migration. Key changes in IPv6 include the absence of traditional NAT, replaced by NAT64 and NAT46 for IPv4 to IPv6 translation, and the introduction of ICMPv6, DHCPv6, and DNSv6 with new record types. The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) has been replaced by the Neighbour Discovery Protocol (NDP), and broadcasts have been eliminated in favor of multicast messaging, enhancing efficiency.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe transcript discusses the concept of Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing, where Cisco routers can have up to four equal cost next hops per path in the routing table. It explains how OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) operates, including the use of the network command to enable OSPF on an interface and advertise networks. The concept of passive interfaces is introduced, which allows advertising a network without forming an adjacency with another router. The importance of having a network in the routing table before it can be advertised is emphasized, along with the process of redistributing a default route into OSPF using the 'default-information originate' command. The transcript also touches on the significance of route types in the routing table, specifically mentioning OSPF learned routes and their external source designation (E1 or E2).\n\n## Document_13\n\nDynamic routing protocols, such as OSPF, facilitate the automatic learning and sharing of routes among routers, allowing for efficient network management as it grows. Unlike static routing, which requires manual configuration, dynamic protocols establish neighbor relationships through hello messages and share subnet information to build routing tables. These protocols automatically select the best path based on metrics, which measure the quality of paths, and can adapt to network changes, such as link failures, by updating routing tables accordingly. OSPF, a widely used Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), assigns costs to links based on bandwidth, while EIGRP offers a more complex metric that considers multiple factors. BGP serves as an Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) for routing between different organizations. Routers can run multiple protocols simultaneously, and the routing table reflects the source of learned routes, indicated by specific codes for each protocol.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe video discusses various routing protocols, focusing on OSPF, BGP, EIGRP, and ISIS. OSPF organizes networks into areas for easier topology planning, while BGP can be used internally (iBGP) and externally (eBGP) and is highly tunable but complex. ISIS is robust but mainly used in large networks. Routers can run multiple protocols simultaneously, and the command 'show IP protocols' reveals all active protocols. The routing table indicates which protocol learned each route, with specific codes for static routes, OSPF, EIGRP, and BGP. The router selects the best path based on administrative distance (AD) when routes from different protocols are available, with EIGRP having a default AD of 90 and OSPF 110. Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) allows the use of multiple routes with the same AD and metric, enhancing load sharing. The video emphasizes the importance of understanding these concepts for further learning, particularly regarding OSPF configuration.\n\n## Document_15\n\nDynamic routing protocols allow routers to automatically learn and share route information, enabling them to adapt to changes in the network without the need for extensive manual configuration of static routes. This adaptability is crucial for maintaining network reliability, especially in environments with many routers. The longest prefix match (LPM) rule is essential for determining which route to use when multiple valid routes exist; the router will select the route with the most specific subnet mask. Additionally, routers use administrative distance values to prioritize routes learned from different sources, with lower values indicating more trusted sources. Floating static routes can be configured as backups with higher administrative distances to ensure redundancy in case primary routes fail, allowing for seamless failover between high-speed and low-speed links.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe video discusses the behavior of static routes in a network, highlighting that shutting down an interface on a router will remove its static route from the routing table, leading to potential traffic loss if the route is still present on other routers. It explains that static routes can be configured with an outgoing interface instead of a next hop IP, which may be useful in small networks. The process of packet forwarding is described, detailing how routers check frame validity, decapsulate frames, and use routing tables to forward packets. The concept of a default route is introduced, which serves as a catch-all for destinations not explicitly listed in the routing table, with a destination network of 0.0.0.0. The video emphasizes the importance of practice in configuring static routing and understanding network topologies, suggesting challenges for viewers to reinforce their learning.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe video discusses the OSI model and various network devices categorized by their operational layers. Layer one devices include modems and hubs, which operate at the physical layer, with modems converting digital signals to analog and vice versa, while hubs replicate electrical signals across multiple ports. Layer two devices include switches and wireless access points (WAPs), with switches using ASIC chips to learn device MAC addresses and communicate within local networks, while WAPs bridge wireless and wired segments. Layer three devices include multi-layer switches and routers, with multi-layer switches providing both switching and routing capabilities, and routers connecting different networks using logical network information. The video also covers security devices such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS), explaining their functions and operational layers. Firewalls can operate at multiple layers and protect networks by blocking packets, while IDS passively monitors for breaches, and IPS actively prevents attacks. Additionally, VPN concentrators facilitate secure connections and can operate at various OSI layers, and load balancers distribute workloads among multiple hosts for efficiency.\n\n## Document_18\n\nIntrusion Detection Systems (IDS) monitor network traffic for potential breaches using signature-based, anomaly-based, or policy-based standards, but cannot prevent attacks on their own. In contrast, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) actively block malicious activity and require all traffic to flow through them for effective operation. VPN concentrators facilitate secure connections for remote hosts through encrypted tunnels, functioning at various OSI model layers, primarily layer 3 for IPsec encryption. Load balancers distribute workloads among servers to enhance efficiency, while proxy servers act on behalf of clients to retrieve resources, filter content, and improve performance through caching. Various VPN types include site-to-site, remote access, and host-to-host, utilizing protocols like IPsec, GRE, PPTP, and TLS for secure connections, with TLS being the most common for modern applications.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe video discusses various networking protocols and services, focusing on VPN technologies such as IPSec, GRE, PPTP, and TLS. IPSec operates in tunnel mode for secure site-to-site VPN connections and uses IKE for key management. GRE allows encapsulation of multiple protocols and supports multicast and broadcast transmissions. PPTP, while older and less secure, can be enhanced with GRE. TLS is highlighted as a modern cryptographic protocol for secure connections, replacing SSL, which is now considered outdated. The video also covers network access services, specifically the Network Interface Controller (NIC), which connects devices to networks and operates at OSI layers 1 and 2, and RADIUS, a protocol for remote user authentication and authorization. Additionally, it explains the DHCP process for dynamic IP addressing, detailing how a DHCP server assigns IP configurations to devices, including the use of discovery, offer, request, and acknowledgment packets, as well as address scopes and reservations.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe DHCP process begins when a PC sends a DHCP Discovery packet to the broadcast address 255.255.255.0 on UDP Port 67. The DHCP server, listening on this port, responds with an offer packet sent to the PC's MAC address on UDP Port 68. The PC then sends a request packet to the DHCP server to accept the offer, and the server replies with an acknowledgement packet containing the IP configuration information. The DHCP server manages an address scope, which is the range of IP addresses it can assign, and can also reserve specific IP addresses for certain devices. Leases are assigned to IP configurations, with a time limit set by the administrator. The DHCP server can be configured to relay requests across network segments. In addition, the video discusses DNS, explaining that it maps human-friendly domain names to IP addresses. DNS servers include local servers, top-level domain servers, and root servers, with authoritative servers providing original records and non-authoritative servers relaying information. Various DNS record types are introduced, including A records for IPv4 addresses, AAAA records for IPv6 addresses, CNAME records for aliases, and MX records for email servers. Dynamic DNS allows for automatic updates to DNS records when IP addresses change, facilitating access to services with dynamic IPs.\n\n## Document_21\n\nAn authoritative DNS server is configured to contain original records and responds directly to requests, while a non-authoritative DNS server provides information received from other servers. Key DNS record types include A records, which map hostnames to IPv4 addresses; AAAA records for IPv6 addresses; CNAME records for aliasing; and MX records for email server mapping. Dynamic DNS (DDNS) allows for automatic updates of DNS records when IP addresses change, facilitating access to services with dynamic IPs. Network Address Translation (NAT) enables routing of non-routable private IP addresses to public IP addresses, with static NAT assigning fixed public IPs and dynamic NAT using a pool of public IPs. Port Address Translation (PAT) enhances scalability by allowing multiple devices to share a single public IP address through unique port numbers. NAT terminology includes inside local addresses (private IPs), inside global addresses (public IPs for local devices), outside global addresses (public IPs for external devices), and outside local addresses (private IPs for external devices).\n\n## Document_22\n\nThe video discusses various aspects of Wide Area Network (WAN) technologies, including Network Address Translation (NAT), the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), and broadband technologies. NAT allows inside devices to communicate with outside devices by translating private and public IP addresses. The PSTN is a foundational WAN technology that supports dial-up and ISDN connections, with ISDN offering digital services through terminal adapters. DSL technologies, including SDSL, ADSL, and VDSL, utilize the PSTN for data transmission, with varying speeds and capabilities. Broadband cable networking delivers voice, data, and television through coaxial cables, requiring compliance with DOCSIS specifications. Fiber optic networking uses light for data transmission, providing higher bandwidth over longer distances and employing standards like SONET and SDH. The video also touches on GSM and CDMA cellular technologies, highlighting their incompatibility and the evolution of cellular networking from 1G to 4G, including HSPA+ as a transitional technology.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe video discusses various wide area network (WAN) technologies, including fiber optic networking, GSM and CDMA cellular connections, YMAX, and satellite WAN connections. Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) allows for multiplexing up to 32 optical carrier levels into a single fiber optic cable, while Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing (CWDM) supports up to 8 channels. Passive Optical Networks (PON) utilize unpowered optical splitters for connecting multiple locations. GSM and CDMA are two incompatible cellular standards used in the U.S., with GSM being more widely adopted globally. The evolution of cellular networking is outlined from 1G to 4G, with LTE offering download speeds of up to 300 Mbps. YMAX provides an alternative broadband connection using microwave transmissions, requiring line of sight, and satellite WAN connections extend networks to hard-to-reach areas but may introduce latency due to the distances involved. Additionally, Metro Ethernet and leased line WAN connections are explained, with leased lines providing dedicated circuits that can utilize protocols like Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) for multiple data transmissions.\n\n## Document_24\n\nLeased lines can utilize either plain old telephone service (POTS) or fiber optic circuits, with costs borne solely by the customer due to exclusive use. The speed of leased lines is determined by the customer's budget, and technologies like Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) allow for multiple layer 3 protocols to be transmitted simultaneously. Multiplexing technologies can increase channel capacity, with T-carrier lines in the US and E-carrier lines in Europe providing various digital signal channels (DS0, DS1, DS3) with specific bandwidths. Fiber optic connections are categorized by Optical Carrier (OC) lines, with OC rates established by SONET and SDH standards, allowing for high-speed data transmission. Circuit-switched networks maintain a dedicated path for communication, while packet-switched networks break data into packets for more efficient routing. Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) are WAN technologies that differ in packet size and efficiency, with Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) offering a scalable solution for managing network traffic across different protocols.\n\n",

Additionally, it explains the DHCP process for dynamic IP addressing, detailing how a DHCP server assigns IP configurations to devices, including the use of discovery, offer, request, and acknowledgment packets, as well as address scopes and reservations.",
      "The DHCP process begins when a PC sends a DHCP Discovery packet to the broadcast address 255.255.255.0 on UDP Port 67. The DHCP server, listening on this port, responds with an offer packet sent to the PC's MAC address on UDP Port 68. The PC then sends a request packet to the DHCP server to accept the offer, and the server replies with an acknowledgement packet containing the IP configuration information. The DHCP server manages an address scope, which is the range of IP addresses it can assign, and can also reserve specific IP addresses for certain devices. Leases are assigned to IP configurations, with a time limit set by the administrator. The DHCP server can be configured to relay requests across network segments. In addition, the video discusses DNS, explaining that it maps human-friendly domain names to IP addresses. DNS servers include local servers, top-level domain servers, and root servers, with authoritative servers providing original records and non-authoritative servers relaying information. Various DNS record types are introduced, including A records for IPv4 addresses, AAAA records for IPv6 addresses, CNAME records for aliases, and MX records for email servers. Dynamic DNS allows for automatic updates to DNS records when IP addresses change, facilitating access to services with dynamic IPs.",
      "An authoritative DNS server is configured to contain original records and responds directly to requests, while a non-authoritative DNS server provides information received from other servers. Key DNS record types include A records, which map hostnames to IPv4 addresses; AAAA records for IPv6 addresses; CNAME records for aliasing; and MX records for email server mapping. Dynamic DNS (DDNS) allows for automatic updates of DNS records when IP addresses change, facilitating access to services with dynamic IPs. Network Address Translation (NAT) enables routing of non-routable private IP addresses to public IP addresses, with static NAT assigning fixed public IPs and dynamic NAT using a pool of public IPs. Port Address Translation (PAT) enhances scalability by allowing multiple devices to share a single public IP address through unique port numbers. NAT terminology includes inside local addresses (private IPs), inside global addresses (public IPs for local devices), outside global addresses (public IPs for external devices), and outside local addresses (private IPs for external devices).",
      "The video discusses various aspects of Wide Area Network (WAN) technologies, including Network Address Translation (NAT), the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), and broadband technologies. NAT allows inside devices to communicate with outside devices by translating private and public IP addresses. The PSTN is a foundational WAN technology that supports dial-up and ISDN connections, with ISDN offering digital services through terminal adapters. DSL technologies, including SDSL, ADSL, and VDSL, utilize the PSTN for data transmission, with varying speeds and capabilities. Broadband cable networking delivers voice, data, and television through coaxial cables, requiring compliance with DOCSIS specifications. Fiber optic networking uses light for data transmission, providing higher bandwidth over longer distances and employing standards like SONET and SDH. The video also touches on GSM and CDMA cellular technologies, highlighting their incompatibility and the evolution of cellular networking from 1G to 4G, including HSPA+ as a transitional technology.",
      "The video discusses various wide area network (WAN) technologies, including fiber optic networking, GSM and CDMA cellular connections, YMAX, and satellite WAN connections. Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) allows for multiplexing up to 32 optical carrier levels into a single fiber optic cable, while Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing (CWDM) supports up to 8 channels. Passive Optical Networks (PON) utilize unpowered optical splitters for connecting multiple locations. GSM and CDMA are two incompatible cellular standards used in the U.S., with GSM being more widely adopted globally. The evolution of cellular networking is outlined from 1G to 4G, with LTE offering download speeds of up to 300 Mbps. YMAX provides an alternative broadband connection using microwave transmissions, requiring line of sight, and satellite WAN connections extend networks to hard-to-reach areas but may introduce latency due to the distances involved. Additionally, Metro Ethernet and leased line WAN connections are explained, with leased lines providing dedicated circuits that can utilize protocols like Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) for multiple data transmissions.",
      "Leased lines can utilize either plain old telephone service (POTS) or fiber optic circuits, with costs borne solely by the customer due to exclusive use. The speed of leased lines is determined by the customer's budget, and technologies like Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) allow for multiple layer 3 protocols to be transmitted simultaneously. Multiplexing technologies can increase channel capacity, with T-carrier lines in the US and E-carrier lines in Europe providing various digital signal channels (DS0, DS1, DS3) with specific bandwidths. Fiber optic connections are categorized by Optical Carrier (OC) lines, with OC rates established by SONET and SDH standards, allowing for high-speed data transmission. Circuit-switched networks maintain a dedicated path for communication, while packet-switched networks break data into packets for more efficient routing. Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) are WAN technologies that differ in packet size and efficiency, with Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) offering a scalable solution for managing network traffic across different protocols."

    "query": "How does IPv6 address assignment and routing differ from IPv4 in terms of address types, configuration methods, and routing protocol support, and what are the implications for devices connected to a Pepwave Balance One?",
    "answer": "IPv6 address assignment differs from IPv4 by introducing new types of addresses and new methods for automatic configuration. IPv6 defines global unicast addresses (publicly routable), link-local addresses (starting with 'fe80', only for local communication), and unique local addresses (private but not internet-routable). Devices connected to a Pepwave Balance One receive both a link-local address (accessible only by devices on the same LAN port) and a global IPv6 address (accessible by any device on the LAN or internet), whereas IPv4 typically uses private addresses behind NAT. IPv6 addresses can be assigned manually, via DHCPv6, or automatically using SLAAC, which leverages router advertisements and the EUI-64 method to generate addresses. IPv6 eliminates the need for NAT for internal/external connectivity, although NAT64/NAT46 exist for interoperability. Routing in IPv6 supports both static and dynamic protocols, such as OSPFv3, with routing tables for IPv6 being independent from IPv4. OSPFv3 is configured differently, using interface assignments instead of network statements, and address families allow simultaneous support for IPv4 and IPv6. IPv6 also replaces ARP with Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) for MAC address resolution and router discovery. The implications for Pepwave Balance One users are that devices will automatically receive both link-local and global IPv6 addresses, can participate in IPv6 routing without NAT, and benefit from improved auto-configuration and routing protocol support over IPv4.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nIt is possible to combine two different speeds of internet connections in Peplink devices using load balancing or SpeedFusion bonding. However, the combined speed will not equal the sum of the two connections (e.g., 80 Mbps) for a single stream due to overhead involved in the process.\n\n## Document_2\n\nSpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding can be used to combine the bandwidth of multiple WAN links, allowing one device behind the Peplink router to utilize the combined bandwidth of both connections, minus the bonding overhead. This technology can effectively increase overall throughput, as demonstrated by a user who combined two 15/1 DSL links to achieve a 25/1.5 connection, resulting in a noticeable improvement in performance.\n\n## Document_3\n\nTo combine two high-speed internet connections effectively, such as a fiber DSL line and a cable connection, bonding is necessary to create a virtual single pipe that aggregates the bandwidth of both connections. The Peplink Balance 2500 and the EPX modular chassis with appropriate expansion cards are capable of supporting over 800Mbps of bonded throughput. However, bonding can be expensive and requires a separate connection point to the internet. Alternatively, Peplink devices can utilize outbound policy for WAN load balancing, allowing for balanced use of both WAN connections for outbound traffic, while inbound traffic would typically be directed to one WAN unless DNS configurations are employed to manage inbound traffic across both connections. This setup can provide failover capabilities, ensuring continuity if one connection fails.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe bandwidth that can be fused using Peplink devices depends on whether encryption is used and the specific device selected. For devices capable of fusing bandwidth up to 1TB, users can refer to comparison tables for the MAX and Balance series, specifically looking at the SpeedFusion VPN Throughput sections. Additionally, bonding requires two ends, and using SpeedFusion Connect will limit throughput to 200Mbps; therefore, hosting FusionHub or using another Peplink router for bonding at the other end is necessary.\n\n## Document_5\n\nTo increase bandwidth and speed by joining an Ethernet WAN connection and a cellular connection on a Peplink Balance 30 Pro, one can utilize SpeedFusion technology. SpeedFusion allows for bandwidth bonding, which combines multiple internet connections for improved performance. The user should consider the differences between SpeedFusion, SpeedFusion Cloud, and FusionHub, as these options provide various capabilities for establishing tunnels and managing connections, particularly when remote equipment is involved.\n\n## Document_6\n\nSpeedFusion is a point-to-point VPN technology that requires at least two devices to create a bonded VPN using multiple WAN connections. Internet traffic can be routed in various ways: it can be load balanced directly to the internet using multiple WANs without utilizing SpeedFusion, or it can be sent over the SpeedFusion tunnel to access the internet through the remote device's internet connectivity.\n\n## Document_7\n\nLoad balancing does not combine multiple WAN connections into a single high-speed link; it steers traffic over multiple WAN connections while using them separately. To achieve the sum of all WAN connections for upload speeds using a secure connection, Peplink's SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding solution is required. This involves setting up a VPN tunnel between two Peplink devices, allowing the four WAN connections to be bonded into one high-speed link. It is important to note that the other end of the SpeedFusion VPN tunnel must have a WAN connection with at least 80 Mbps speeds to effectively combine the four 20 Mbps WAN connections.\n\n## Document_8\n\nA single Peplink Balance 310 router can be used to combine two 20MB/2MB DSL lines into a single 40MB/4MB connection using SpeedFusion technology, which requires an endpoint such as a FusionHub appliance in AWS or another Peplink router with a sufficient internet connection. However, this setup may incur additional costs for the SpeedFusion license and colocation charges. Alternatively, the Balance routers can load balance the connections, allowing for simultaneous use of both lines for applications that support it, although this may not work for streaming or encrypted services.\n\n## Document_9\n\nPeplink SpeedFusion technology allows for the bonding of multiple internet connections to provide a combined bandwidth, enhancing throughput and redundancy. It utilizes built-in VPN technology to achieve this, differentiating it from simple load balancing. To implement SpeedFusion, both ends of the connection must utilize Peplink devices, as SpeedFusion requires compatible hardware to function effectively. The proposed setup involves using a Peplink 710 in the main office with multiple ADSL connections and a Peplink Balance 20 at home or branch offices to achieve increased download speeds through bonded connections.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo achieve a reliable and fast connection by bonding three ADSL WAN connections, a Peplink Balance device with SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding is recommended. SpeedFusion allows for the bonding of multiple WAN connections to create a single, faster connection for internet use, including web, VoIP, and Skype. The Balance 50 does not support SpeedFusion, which means it cannot perform bandwidth bonding. For testing SpeedFusion, FusionHub can be used as a software-only solution. When using SpeedFusion, it is possible to bond connections from multiple WAN providers and send the combined bandwidth to the internet, provided that the remote VPS has sufficient bandwidth. The best operating system for a VPS running SpeedFusion is not specified, but it is implied that SpeedFusion may not require a traditional operating system. For local setups, a server with multiple Ethernet ports is needed to connect the WANs and provide a single LAN output, and the best operating system for such a server is not detailed.\n\n## Document_11\n\nTo achieve a reliable and fast connection by bonding multiple ADSL WAN connections, a Balance router is recommended over FusionHub, which is a virtual appliance with only one WAN port and operates on a hypervisor. SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding is essential for creating bonded WAN connections, and the Balance 50 device, while having five WAN ports, does not support SpeedFusion, meaning it cannot perform bandwidth bonding. MediaFast capability is mentioned but not explained in the response.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo achieve a reliable and fast connection by bonding multiple ADSL WAN connections, a Balance Router is recommended, specifically models B210 or higher, which support SpeedFusion for bandwidth bonding. SpeedFusion allows the combination of total bandwidth from all WANs into a single connection. Balance One and B305 do not come with SpeedFusion but can be upgraded with a software license. PepVPN is available on all Balance routers but does not provide bonding as it only utilizes one active WAN connection in the VPN tunnel. SpeedFusion VPN requires TCP 32015 and UDP 4500 for traffic establishment.\n\n## Document_13\n\nTo maximize three internet connections using SpeedFusion, one can consider options like a Balance 310 with FusionHub on AWS for bandwidth aggregation and WAN load balancing. SpeedFusion bonding typically occurs between two trusted devices, and it is important to assess specific requirements, such as needing a minimum bandwidth for applications, which may necessitate a bonding solution if individual WAN links do not meet the required bandwidth.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo maximize internet connections using SpeedFusion, a user can consider a Peplink Balance 310 with a FusionHub license on AWS. For bonding, at least one device should be a Peplink Balance 201 or 301, while a Balance ONE Core may be sufficient for both ends in some cases. When SpeedFusion bonding is set up between two users, one with a 100/40Mbps fiber connection and another with 36/2.5Mbps from three ISPs, the expected internet speed will depend on the bonding configuration and the capabilities of the devices used.\n\n## Document_15\n\nTo achieve faster internet speeds using a Peplink Balance device, WAN load balancing (Aggregation) can be utilized to distribute internet traffic across multiple WAN connections. However, bonded WAN speed will only be effective for the ISP connected to the Balance device. SpeedFusion Bonding can combine all available WANs, but it requires consideration of additional bandwidth for rerouting traffic, especially if using a UK site. For optimal performance, a Balance 380 is recommended for the UK site with 2 x 100/20 Mbps connections, while a Balance 210 is suggested for the user's site with 1 x 13/1 Mbps and 1 x 10/0.5 Mbps connections. It's important to note that SpeedFusion Bonding may not significantly assist with tasks requiring high upload speeds, such as backing up large data collections to the cloud.\n\n## Document_16\n\nSpeedFusion can enhance bandwidth utilization by allowing a single network session to use more bandwidth than available on a single WAN link. To implement SpeedFusion, a remote device with a fast internet connection is required, which acts as a gateway. Internet traffic from the local device is routed through this remote device and sent via SpeedFusion VPN to the local router. A recommended solution is to host a Fusionhub virtual appliance in the cloud, which serves as a SpeedFusion VPN concentrator, facilitating this setup effectively.\n\n## Document_17\n\nBandwidth bonding can be achieved using Peplink's SpeedFusion VPN technology, which requires a compatible device on both ends of the connection to effectively combine multiple WAN connections for increased upload bandwidth.\n\n## Document_18\n\nTo achieve bonded connectivity that combines the speeds of multiple WAN connections on a single PC, SpeedFusion technology is required, as load balancing alone will not accomplish this. The original poster's attempt to use load balancing with a Peplink Balance 30 to aggregate three WANs into one speed was misguided, as load balancing distributes traffic rather than bonding it.\n\n## Document_19\n\nBandwidth bonding with SpeedFusion is a site-to-site VPN technology that is available on Peplink Balance 210 and higher routers. For users without a remote office, a virtual appliance called FusionHub can be deployed at a datacenter or on AWS cloud to facilitate bonding. Additionally, there is a service called Simply Bonding that manages the other side of the SpeedFusion tunnel using Peplink products.\n\n## Document_20\n\nSpeedFusion is a VPN that allows for the combination of multiple connections for increased bandwidth, error correction, and traffic mirroring over multiple links. Data flows from the device to the Peplink router, then to the nearest SpeedFusion server and out to the work server, with returning data following the same path in reverse. The SpeedFusion tunnel may introduce overhead, potentially reducing speeds depending on the mode used; mirroring may slow down the connection while aggregation could increase speeds. For optimal performance, if using a MiFi device with the Peplink B-1 router, it should be set to IP passthrough mode and connected via USB tethering if not using the 5G model of the router.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo achieve true bonding and increased download speeds by combining multiple connections on a Peplink device, SpeedFusion technology is required, which can be implemented through a FusionHub or another Peplink device. The SpeedFusion dynamic link bonding has an overhead of 18 to 30%, meaning that even with two 500 Mbps connections, the combined speed will not exceed 800 Mbps. Currently, the Peplink SDX can only perform load balancing without SpeedFusion, and users are advised to consult their Peplink partner or forums for optimization guidance.\n\n## Document_22\n\nPeplink's bonding technology, particularly SpeedFusion, allows for the aggregation of multiple WAN connections, providing increased reliability and bandwidth without the need for specialized carrier connectivity. Unlike traditional IPsec and LACP bonding methods, which have limitations such as requiring identical circuits or being sensitive to latency and packet loss, SpeedFusion can utilize any internet connection from various providers, including 4G, 5G, DSL, and satellite. This dynamic bonding capability enables users to achieve higher throughput and reliability, making it a compelling solution for businesses needing consistent internet performance. The technology emerged from the need to bond multiple connections for applications requiring more bandwidth than a single connection could provide, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.\n\n## Document_23\n\nSpeedFusion is a tunnel bonded VPN technology that aggregates multiple internet connections to create a session-persistent and reliable VPN connection between two Peplink endpoints. It operates using AES 256-bit and 4096 DH encrypted tunnels, allowing for secure communication across various WAN circuits. Only the Hub site needs to have public or publicly accessible IP addresses, while peer sites can operate behind NAT or CGNAT, making it versatile for modern networking environments. SpeedFusion is easier to set up than traditional IPsec VPNs and offers greater capabilities, including the ability to bond multiple connections such as 5G and cable modems. The SDX router can support up to 200 remote peers, and configurations can be adjusted to avoid IP conflicts, ensuring seamless connectivity.\n\n## Document_24\n\nTo utilize SpeedFusion or bonding, at least two Peplink devices are required, with one needing a public IP address. SpeedFusion offers multiple connection configurations, including point-to-point, mesh, and star topologies. Key features include bandwidth bonding, WAN smoothing to reduce jitter, and hot failover for maintaining session persistence during link failures. SpeedFusion Connect, Peplink's public bonding service, has a throughput limit of 200 Mbps, while hosting a FusionHub in a private cloud allows for unrestricted throughput based on the device's capabilities. WAN smoothing duplicates traffic across multiple connections to enhance reliability for VoIP and video applications, while Forward Error Correction (FEC) minimizes overhead during one-way communications. Outbound policies can be configured to manage traffic across different tunnels, optimizing performance for various applications.\n\n## Document_25\n\nTo combine a DSL fiber connection with a cable connection for increased bandwidth, SpeedFusion technology can be utilized, specifically with a FusionHub for optimal performance. It is important to ensure that both connections have low latency and minimal packet loss for effective bonding. The hardware required to achieve gigabit speeds will need to be robust, and users should check the SpeedFusion encrypted throughput specifications on the Peplink Balance routers to ensure they meet the necessary performance requirements.\n\n## Document_26\n\nTo combine a fiber DSL connection with a cable connection at packet level, a Peplink multi-WAN Balance router with a SpeedFusion license is necessary. This setup allows for channel bonding, effectively increasing download and upload speeds by aggregating the bandwidth from both connections. It is important to ensure that the SpeedFusion license is included with the router or accounted for in the overall cost, as it can be expensive if purchased separately.

      "It is possible to combine two different speeds of internet connections in Peplink devices using load balancing or SpeedFusion bonding. However, the combined speed will not equal the sum of the two connections (e.g., 80 Mbps) for a single stream due to overhead involved in the process.",
      "SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding can be used to combine the bandwidth of multiple WAN links, allowing one device behind the Peplink router to utilize the combined bandwidth of both connections, minus the bonding overhead. This technology can effectively increase overall throughput, as demonstrated by a user who combined two 15/1 DSL links to achieve a 25/1.5 connection, resulting in a noticeable improvement in performance.",
      "To combine two high-speed internet connections effectively, such as a fiber DSL line and a cable connection, bonding is necessary to create a virtual single pipe that aggregates the bandwidth of both connections. The Peplink Balance 2500 and the EPX modular chassis with appropriate expansion cards are capable of supporting over 800Mbps of bonded throughput. However, bonding can be expensive and requires a separate connection point to the internet. Alternatively, Peplink devices can utilize outbound policy for WAN load balancing, allowing for balanced use of both WAN connections for outbound traffic, while inbound traffic would typically be directed to one WAN unless DNS configurations are employed to manage inbound traffic across both connections. This setup can provide failover capabilities, ensuring continuity if one connection fails.",
      "The bandwidth that can be fused using Peplink devices depends on whether encryption is used and the specific device selected. For devices capable of fusing bandwidth up to 1TB, users can refer to comparison tables for the MAX and Balance series, specifically looking at the SpeedFusion VPN Throughput sections. Additionally, bonding requires two ends, and using SpeedFusion Connect will limit throughput to 200Mbps; therefore, hosting FusionHub or using another Peplink router for bonding at the other end is necessary.",
      "To increase bandwidth and speed by joining an Ethernet WAN connection and a cellular connection on a Peplink Balance 30 Pro, one can utilize SpeedFusion technology. SpeedFusion allows for bandwidth bonding, which combines multiple internet connections for improved performance. The user should consider the differences between SpeedFusion, SpeedFusion Cloud, and FusionHub, as these options provide various capabilities for establishing tunnels and managing connections, particularly when remote equipment is involved.",
      "SpeedFusion is a point-to-point VPN technology that requires at least two devices to create a bonded VPN using multiple WAN connections. Internet traffic can be routed in various ways: it can be load balanced directly to the internet using multiple WANs without utilizing SpeedFusion, or it can be sent over the SpeedFusion tunnel to access the internet through the remote device's internet connectivity.",
      "Load balancing does not combine multiple WAN connections into a single high-speed link; it steers traffic over multiple WAN connections while using them separately. To achieve the sum of all WAN connections for upload speeds using a secure connection, Peplink's SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding solution is required. This involves setting up a VPN tunnel between two Peplink devices, allowing the four WAN connections to be bonded into one high-speed link. It is important to note that the other end of the SpeedFusion VPN tunnel must have a WAN connection with at least 80 Mbps speeds to effectively combine the four 20 Mbps WAN connections.",
      "A single Peplink Balance 310 router can be used to combine two 20MB/2MB DSL lines into a single 40MB/4MB connection using SpeedFusion technology, which requires an endpoint such as a FusionHub appliance in AWS or another Peplink router with a sufficient internet connection. However, this setup may incur additional costs for the SpeedFusion license and colocation charges. Alternatively, the Balance routers can load balance the connections, allowing for simultaneous use of both lines for applications that support it, although this may not work for streaming or encrypted services.",
      "Peplink SpeedFusion technology allows for the bonding of multiple internet connections to provide a combined bandwidth, enhancing throughput and redundancy. It utilizes built-in VPN technology to achieve this, differentiating it from simple load balancing. To implement SpeedFusion, both ends of the connection must utilize Peplink devices, as SpeedFusion requires compatible hardware to function effectively. The proposed setup involves using a Peplink 710 in the main office with multiple ADSL connections and a Peplink Balance 20 at home or branch offices to achieve increased download speeds through bonded connections.",
      "To achieve a reliable and fast connection by bonding three ADSL WAN connections, a Peplink Balance device with SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding is recommended. SpeedFusion allows for the bonding of multiple WAN connections to create a single, faster connection for internet use, including web, VoIP, and Skype. The Balance 50 does not support SpeedFusion, which means it cannot perform bandwidth bonding. For testing SpeedFusion, FusionHub can be used as a software-only solution. When using SpeedFusion, it is possible to bond connections from multiple WAN providers and send the combined bandwidth to the internet, provided that the remote VPS has sufficient bandwidth. The best operating system for a VPS running SpeedFusion is not specified, but it is implied that SpeedFusion may not require a traditional operating system. For local setups, a server with multiple Ethernet ports is needed to connect the WANs and provide a single LAN output, and the best operating system for such a server is not detailed.",
      "To achieve a reliable and fast connection by bonding multiple ADSL WAN connections, a Balance router is recommended over FusionHub, which is a virtual appliance with only one WAN port and operates on a hypervisor. SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding is essential for creating bonded WAN connections, and the Balance 50 device, while having five WAN ports, does not support SpeedFusion, meaning it cannot perform bandwidth bonding. MediaFast capability is mentioned but not explained in the response.",
      "To achieve a reliable and fast connection by bonding multiple ADSL WAN connections, a Balance Router is recommended, specifically models B210 or higher, which support SpeedFusion for bandwidth bonding. SpeedFusion allows the combination of total bandwidth from all WANs into a single connection. Balance One and B305 do not come with SpeedFusion but can be upgraded with a software license. PepVPN is available on all Balance routers but does not provide bonding as it only utilizes one active WAN connection in the VPN tunnel. SpeedFusion VPN requires TCP 32015 and UDP 4500 for traffic establishment.",
      "To maximize three internet connections using SpeedFusion, one can consider options like a Balance 310 with FusionHub on AWS for bandwidth aggregation and WAN load balancing. SpeedFusion bonding typically occurs between two trusted devices, and it is important to assess specific requirements, such as needing a minimum bandwidth for applications, which may necessitate a bonding solution if individual WAN links do not meet the required bandwidth.",
      "To maximize internet connections using SpeedFusion, a user can consider a Peplink Balance 310 with a FusionHub license on AWS. For bonding, at least one device should be a Peplink Balance 201 or 301, while a Balance ONE Core may be sufficient for both ends in some cases. When SpeedFusion bonding is set up between two users, one with a 100/40Mbps fiber connection and another with 36/2.5Mbps from three ISPs, the expected internet speed will depend on the bonding configuration and the capabilities of the devices used.",
      "To achieve faster internet speeds using a Peplink Balance device, WAN load balancing (Aggregation) can be utilized to distribute internet traffic across multiple WAN connections. However, bonded WAN speed will only be effective for the ISP connected to the Balance device. SpeedFusion Bonding can combine all available WANs, but it requires consideration of additional bandwidth for rerouting traffic, especially if using a UK site. For optimal performance, a Balance 380 is recommended for the UK site with 2 x 100/20 Mbps connections, while a Balance 210 is suggested for the user's site with 1 x 13/1 Mbps and 1 x 10/0.5 Mbps connections. It's important to note that SpeedFusion Bonding may not significantly assist with tasks requiring high upload speeds, such as backing up large data collections to the cloud.",
      "SpeedFusion can enhance bandwidth utilization by allowing a single network session to use more bandwidth than available on a single WAN link. To implement SpeedFusion, a remote device with a fast internet connection is required, which acts as a gateway. Internet traffic from the local device is routed through this remote device and sent via SpeedFusion VPN to the local router. A recommended solution is to host a Fusionhub virtual appliance in the cloud, which serves as a SpeedFusion VPN concentrator, facilitating this setup effectively.",
      "Bandwidth bonding can be achieved using Peplink's SpeedFusion VPN technology, which requires a compatible device on both ends of the connection to effectively combine multiple WAN connections for increased upload bandwidth.",
      "To achieve bonded connectivity that combines the speeds of multiple WAN connections on a single PC, SpeedFusion technology is required, as load balancing alone will not accomplish this. The original poster's attempt to use load balancing with a Peplink Balance 30 to aggregate three WANs into one speed was misguided, as load balancing distributes traffic rather than bonding it.",
      "Bandwidth bonding with SpeedFusion is a site-to-site VPN technology that is available on Peplink Balance 210 and higher routers. For users without a remote office, a virtual appliance called FusionHub can be deployed at a datacenter or on AWS cloud to facilitate bonding. Additionally, there is a service called Simply Bonding that manages the other side of the SpeedFusion tunnel using Peplink products.",
      "SpeedFusion is a VPN that allows for the combination of multiple connections for increased bandwidth, error correction, and traffic mirroring over multiple links. Data flows from the device to the Peplink router, then to the nearest SpeedFusion server and out to the work server, with returning data following the same path in reverse. The SpeedFusion tunnel may introduce overhead, potentially reducing speeds depending on the mode used; mirroring may slow down the connection while aggregation could increase speeds. For optimal performance, if using a MiFi device with the Peplink B-1 router, it should be set to IP passthrough mode and connected via USB tethering if not using the 5G model of the router.",
      "To achieve true bonding and increased download speeds by combining multiple connections on a Peplink device, SpeedFusion technology is required, which can be implemented through a FusionHub or another Peplink device. The SpeedFusion dynamic link bonding has an overhead of 18 to 30%, meaning that even with two 500 Mbps connections, the combined speed will not exceed 800 Mbps. Currently, the Peplink SDX can only perform load balancing without SpeedFusion, and users are advised to consult their Peplink partner or forums for optimization guidance.",
      "Peplink's bonding technology, particularly SpeedFusion, allows for the aggregation of multiple WAN connections, providing increased reliability and bandwidth without the need for specialized carrier connectivity. Unlike traditional IPsec and LACP bonding methods, which have limitations such as requiring identical circuits or being sensitive to latency and packet loss, SpeedFusion can utilize any internet connection from various providers, including 4G, 5G, DSL, and satellite. This dynamic bonding capability enables users to achieve higher throughput and reliability, making it a compelling solution for businesses needing consistent internet performance. The technology emerged from the need to bond multiple connections for applications requiring more bandwidth than a single connection could provide, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.",
      "SpeedFusion is a tunnel bonded VPN technology that aggregates multiple internet connections to create a session-persistent and reliable VPN connection between two Peplink endpoints. It operates using AES 256-bit and 4096 DH encrypted tunnels, allowing for secure communication across various WAN circuits. Only the Hub site needs to have public or publicly accessible IP addresses, while peer sites can operate behind NAT or CGNAT, making it versatile for modern networking environments. SpeedFusion is easier to set up than traditional IPsec VPNs and offers greater capabilities, including the ability to bond multiple connections such as 5G and cable modems. The SDX router can support up to 200 remote peers, and configurations can be adjusted to avoid IP conflicts, ensuring seamless connectivity.",
      "To utilize SpeedFusion or bonding, at least two Peplink devices are required, with one needing a public IP address. SpeedFusion offers multiple connection configurations, including point-to-point, mesh, and star topologies. Key features include bandwidth bonding, WAN smoothing to reduce jitter, and hot failover for maintaining session persistence during link failures. SpeedFusion Connect, Peplink's public bonding service, has a throughput limit of 200 Mbps, while hosting a FusionHub in a private cloud allows for unrestricted throughput based on the device's capabilities. WAN smoothing duplicates traffic across multiple connections to enhance reliability for VoIP and video applications, while Forward Error Correction (FEC) minimizes overhead during one-way communications. Outbound policies can be configured to manage traffic across different tunnels, optimizing performance for various applications.",

    "query": "How can a technician add a second wired WAN connection to the Pepwave Balance 20X, what are the limitations, and what configuration steps or considerations are necessary?",
    "answer": "To add a second wired WAN connection to the Pepwave Balance 20X, a technician can use a USB Ethernet adapter. The device has only one built-in WAN port, but the USB port can be used with a USB-to-Ethernet dongle to add WAN2. When connected, the adapter may appear in the Status section, but it will only show up in Network settings once properly configured and with an active link. As of firmware 8.3.0, the Balance 20X can support up to three wired WANs: one via the WAN port, one via a LAN port configured as a Virtual WAN, and one via the USB Ethernet adapter. However, the USB port's speed is limited compared to the built-in WAN; it typically supports up to 200–300 Mbps, but in some cases may be limited to 100 Mbps. Not all USB Ethernet adapters are guaranteed to be compatible, and the device manual does not officially confirm support for this feature. It is also important to note that the USB WAN is suitable for lower-capacity connections due to these speed limitations.

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nThe rated throughput of the Peplink MAX BR1 Mini (HW3) is 300 Mbps, which is a theoretical maximum that can be affected by the features enabled on the device. Enabling additional features can reduce the throughput significantly, with some users reporting speeds as low as 50 Mbps when many features are active. For users requiring full 500 Mbps performance, it is recommended to use the Peplink BR1 Pro instead of the Mini model.\n\n## Document_2\n\nWhen using a Pepwave Max Transit Duo with SpeedFusion bonding, individual cellular connections may perform adequately on their own, but bonding them can be challenging due to fluctuations in cellular speeds and packet sequencing issues. Users have reported difficulties achieving faster download speeds when bonding two cellular connections, although combining them for upload purposes may yield better results. Adjustments to settings such as MTU and WAN Connection Buffer Size have been attempted without significant improvement in overall speed. Additionally, streaming services may be blocked when using a VPN, complicating access for devices like Apple TV.\n\n## Document_3\n\nWhen using two unlimited AT&T SIM cards in a Pepwave Max Transit Duo with SpeedFusion bonding, users may experience slower speeds than expected due to bandwidth sharing limitations at the cell tower. Testing individual SIM cards and comparing their speeds with a weighted balance outbound policy can help determine the available bandwidth from the location. It is common for bonded speeds to be worse than single connections due to overhead and the maximum available bandwidth to the FusionHub.\n\n## Document_4\n\nTo optimize the performance of two AT&T connections on a Pepwave Max Transit Duo, it is recommended to use WAN Analysis to test each connection individually and then together, ensuring they are configured to use the same bands. If the connections do not show similar bandwidth figures when tested individually, it may indicate issues with the tower's handling of the connections. Additionally, the router allows for temporarily pausing a bond member connection based on latency thresholds, which can help improve bonding performance, although it may not fully resolve issues related to latency differences.\n\n## Document_5\n\nIt is possible to combine two different speeds of internet connections in Peplink devices using load balancing or SpeedFusion bonding. However, the combined speed will not equal the sum of the two connections (e.g., 80 Mbps) for a single stream due to overhead involved in the process.\n\n## Document_6\n\nTo combine a DSL fiber connection with a cable connection for improved overall internet speeds, a combination of load balancing and SpeedFusion technology can be utilized. SpeedFusion allows for the creation of a more reliable connection by aggregating bandwidth from multiple WAN sources. However, it is important to account for overhead, which can reduce effective speeds; for example, a combined upload speed of 140 Mbps may yield around 110 Mbps after accounting for overhead, and a combined download speed of 1000 Mbps may yield around 800 Mbps. Devices requiring a stable connection can be prioritized over SpeedFusion, while other devices can be connected directly to the gigabit WAN to avoid impacting SpeedFusion throughput.\n\n## Document_7\n\nWhen considering the Pepwave model 380, user recommendations are based on expected active sessions, with the model being suitable for 100-500 users. However, actual user count may not be the only factor; throughput is also critical. For instance, a user with only 55 users found the 380 necessary due to throughput concerns, particularly with an 8/8 synchronous T1 line and two UVerse lines. As internet speeds increase, throughput can become a bottleneck after applying load balancing and firewall policies. The user is considering upgrading to a fiber connection with a potential speed of 50 MB.\n\n## Document_8\n\nWhen using a PepVPN with a Pepwave MAX BR1, the throughput is limited by the upload capacity of the BR1, which is 5 Mbps in this case. The BR1 is rated for a maximum of 20 Mbps encrypted throughput, meaning that while it can receive data at higher speeds, the upload speed restricts the overall throughput when routing traffic through the PepVPN.\n\n## Document_9\n\nFor a rural internet setup with unreliable service providers, the Peplink Balance One Core router is recommended, especially when paired with a 5-WAN license, allowing for up to 5 Ethernet-based WAN connections and an additional USB WAN connection for a cellular modem. This configuration can help bond multiple internet sources to improve overall connectivity and reliability for various household uses, including remote work, online business, and streaming services.\n\n## Document_10\n\nFor a rural internet setup with multiple unreliable providers, a Peplink Balance 305 router is a suitable choice for bonding connections from various ISPs and a Verizon Jetpack. This router can support remote access for work, home-based business operations, and streaming services like Plex, Netflix, and Hulu. The user has a wired Ethernet setup and plans to use separate WiFi access points, indicating a need for robust network management and performance optimization across multiple devices.\n\n## Document_11\n\nSpeedFusion can be used to bond WAN connections, allowing for the potential aggregation of bandwidth from multiple connections. If three radios are used, each providing 10 Mbps down and 2 Mbps up, the theoretical WAN speed could be 30 Mbps down and 6 Mbps up. However, actual performance will depend on the quality and available bandwidth from the Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP), as this type of connection is subject to contention and does not guarantee bandwidth like a T1 connection.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo optimize SpeedFusion performance with two 5G connections, it is recommended to turn off Dynamic Weighted Balance (DWB). When DWB is enabled, the algorithm throttles back traffic through a WAN connection as its latency increases, which can lead to suboptimal utilization of both connections. Disabling DWB allows SpeedFusion to fully saturate both links, improving overall speed potential.\n\n## Document_13\n\nSpeedFusion does not provide additive bandwidth when combining connections; for example, two 200 Mbps connections do not yield 400 Mbps but rather a robust 200 Mbps connection. Users have reported that when using two similar 5G connections, SpeedFusion tends to utilize one SIM fully while only partially using the second, which can drag down overall speed. In contrast, when using a single 5G connection, users can achieve the full potential of that connection. Additionally, combining cellular connections for increased download bandwidth has proven more challenging compared to upload bandwidth, as evidenced by user experiences with DSL connections where SpeedFusion successfully bonded two DSL lines to achieve higher speeds.\n\n## Document_14\n\nWhen using SpeedFusion with two similar 5G connections, it may result in suboptimal performance where one connection is utilized fully while the other contributes minimally, potentially dragging down overall speed. To address this, users can access the router's support.cgi web page and adjust the PepVPN Traffic Distribution mode to optimize the use of multiple connections.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Pepwave MAX BR1 and MAX BR1 Mini devices have a routing throughput of approximately 100Mbps. When using an encrypted SpeedFusion tunnel, the throughput is significantly reduced, resulting in lower speeds compared to direct WAN connections. For example, the Max Transit has a routed throughput of 400Mbps, with 100Mbps for unencrypted SpeedFusion and 60Mbps for encrypted SpeedFusion. The Balance One offers 600Mbps routed throughput, with 60Mbps for unencrypted SpeedFusion and 30Mbps for encrypted SpeedFusion.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe Pepwave MAX BR1 and MAX BR1 Mini have an encrypted VPN throughput rating of 20Mbps. In the case where the SpeedFusion tunnel is significantly slower than the WAN connection, it is suggested that the issue may be due to high point-to-point latency or packet loss affecting the cellular connection. Running a VPN speed test and checking the PepVPN/SpeedFusion charts may provide further insights into the performance issues.\n\n## Document_17\n\nIn cases where the SpeedFusion tunnel is significantly slower than the WAN connection, it is important to check for packet loss on the uplink, as this can greatly affect performance. Enabling DSL cable optimization can help mitigate upload packet loss by duplicating sent ACK packets. Additionally, understanding the type of wired WAN connection being used may provide further insights into the issue.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Pepwave Max Transit Duo has a rated encrypted VPN throughput of 60Mbps and an unencrypted throughput of 100Mbps. The raw WAN to LAN speed rating is 400Mbps. This indicates that if the device is capping speeds at 30-40Mbps, it may be due to the limitations of the VPN throughput when using SpeedFusion Cloud, rather than the WAN connection itself.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe Pepwave MAX Transit has a specified maximum throughput of 400mbps, which aligns with observed WAN to LAN speeds of approximately 350mbps. The LAN speed can reach around 600mbps, although this may vary depending on the specific network configuration and connected devices. High CPU usage (90-100%) during high-speed data transfers (50+mbps) may indicate performance limitations, but no specific causes or solutions were identified in the conversation.\n\n## Document_20\n\nA new device specifically designed for the media and broadcasting industry is being launched, which is currently undergoing CE and FCC certifications. This device aims to address the needs of broadcasters by potentially including features such as bandwidth bonding and compatibility with video cameras, which are currently lacking in existing Pepwave solutions like the MAX Transit DUO.\n\n## Document_21\n\nThe maximum throughput for various Pepwave MAX Series products is as follows: MAX 700 has a router throughput of 100 Mbps bi-directional and a SpeedFusion throughput of 30 Mbps (AES256). MAX HD2 also has a router throughput of 100 Mbps bi-directional and a SpeedFusion throughput of 30 Mbps (AES256). MAX On-The-Go has a router throughput of 100 Mbps bi-directional and a SpeedFusion throughput of 20 Mbps (AES256). MAX BR1 features a router throughput of 100 Mbps bi-directional and a SpeedFusion throughput of 20 Mbps (AES256).\n\n## Document_22\n\nTo estimate a bonded internet connection using SpeedFusion, if four 30Mbps/1.5Mbps links are bonded, the theoretical total would be 120Mbps/6Mbps minus overhead. However, actual speed tests may reflect the performance of the weakest link, potentially showing 30Mbps/1.5Mbps instead. When combining connections, it's important to note that if multiple DSL connections are from the same provider, they may share the same copper infrastructure, leading to interference and reduced performance. Mixing different types of connections, such as DSL, 4G, and Starlink, is recommended for better overall stability and performance.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe Pepwave MAX Transit Duo Pro has a maximum throughput of approximately 150 Mbps when encrypted and 350 Mbps when unencrypted. For running FusionHub, a license may be required, and it is advisable to check with Peplink for purchasing options if the device is second-hand. Additionally, using standard VPS providers can offer better price/performance compared to AWS, with some providers offering unlimited data at up to 500 Mbps throughput and direct peering with T-Mobile and Verizon.\n\n## Document_24\n\nTo achieve true bonding and increased download speeds by combining multiple connections on a Peplink device, SpeedFusion technology is required, which can be implemented through a FusionHub or another Peplink device. The SpeedFusion dynamic link bonding has an overhead of 18 to 30%, meaning that even with two 500 Mbps connections, the combined speed will not exceed 800 Mbps. Currently, the Peplink SDX can only perform load balancing without SpeedFusion, and users are advised to consult their Peplink partner or forums for optimization guidance.\n\n## Document_25\n\nWithout SpeedFusion enabled, having two connections set to priority 1 will allow for failover when one connection drops, but it will not provide load balancing in the sense of combining speeds from both connections. Load balancing can direct traffic over multiple connections, but it does not aggregate bandwidth from WAN A and WAN B. SpeedFusion, on the other hand, tunnels traffic down multiple paths and combines it into a single reliable connection, but it may reduce overall speeds due to the overhead involved in the bonding process.\n\n## Document_26\n\nRegular load balancing with two WAN connections will distribute traffic between the links but will not increase the speed of any single connection. SpeedFusion dynamic load balancing merges two connections for increased throughput, typically using a cloud endpoint. In a configuration with one WAN as priority 1 and another as priority 2, SpeedFusion operates in hot failover mode, maintaining active connections and switching traffic if the primary fails. SpeedFusion incurs a 15 to 30% overhead, meaning that two 50 Mbps links do not combine to 100 Mbps but rather yield around 80 Mbps. SpeedFusion Connect is limited to 200 Mbps, while devices with HW3 have a no-load routing limit of 300 Mbps and approximately 60 Mbps over SpeedFusion with PrimeCare.\n\n## Document_27\n\nThe Peplink MAX BR1 Mini (HW3) has a WAN port rated at 1 Gbps, but its actual throughput capacity is limited to 300 Mbps, which is a common characteristic in many networking products. This means that even when connected to a higher-speed internet connection, the router may not be able to utilize the full bandwidth due to its inherent throughput limitations.\n\n## Document_28\n\nThe Peplink MAX BR1 Mini (HW3) has a rated throughput of 300 Mbps, which applies even when connected to the internet through its 1 Gbps WAN port. Users have observed that the maximum throughput when using this router can reach 250-300 Mbps, indicating a potential limit on the WAN port's performance, especially when compared to other routers like the Unifi EdgeRouter POE-5 that can achieve higher speeds with the same internet connection.\n\n## Document_29\n\nThe rated throughput of the Peplink MAX BR1 Mini (HW3) is 300 Mbps, which applies to its overall router capacity rather than the WAN port capacity, which is 1 Gbps. Users can expect actual TCP throughput to be around 270 Mbps based on general experiences with Peplink routers. This means that while the WAN port can handle connections up to 1 Gbps, the router's throughput limit caps the effective speed to approximately 300 Mbps.\n\n## Document_30\n\nTo combine a DSL fiber connection with a cable connection for increased bandwidth, SpeedFusion technology can be utilized, specifically with a FusionHub for optimal performance. It is important to ensure that both connections have low latency and minimal packet loss for effective bonding. The hardware required to achieve gigabit speeds will need to be robust, and users should check the SpeedFusion encrypted throughput specifications on the Peplink Balance routers to ensure they meet the necessary performance requirements.\n\n## Document_31\n\nSpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding can be used to combine the bandwidth of multiple WAN links, allowing one device behind the Peplink router to utilize the combined bandwidth of both connections, minus the bonding overhead. This technology can effectively increase overall throughput, as demonstrated by a user who combined two 15/1 DSL links to achieve a 25/1.5 connection, resulting in a noticeable improvement in performance.\n\n## Document_32\n\nTo combine a fiber DSL connection with a cable connection at packet level, a Peplink multi-WAN Balance router with a SpeedFusion license is necessary. This setup allows for channel bonding, effectively increasing download and upload speeds by aggregating the bandwidth from both connections. It is important to ensure that the SpeedFusion license is included with the router or accounted for in the overall cost, as it can be expensive if purchased separately. Additionally, the router should be compatible with the existing network setup to avoid issues like double NAT, which can affect device connectivity and security.\n\n## Document_33\n\nTo combine a DSL fiber connection with a cable connection for increased bandwidth, a Pepwave router capable of channel bonding is needed. The goal is to achieve a combined speed of approximately 1 Gbps download and 140 Mbps upload without creating a double NAT situation, allowing the Google WiFi system to remain the DHCP handler. The user is looking for a non-WiFi Pepwave device that can handle high throughput, as residential-grade devices typically offer lower speeds.\n\n## Document_34\n\nTo combine multiple internet connections effectively, one can use load balancing or bonding techniques. Load balancing allows for distributing traffic across multiple WAN connections, while bonding treats them as a single connection for applications. The feasibility of bonding depends on the reliability of the connections; if one connection is prone to outages, bonding may be more beneficial. Pepwave devices can facilitate these functions, but the user should consider the cost versus the reliability of their connections before investing in bonding technology.\n\n## Document_35\n\nTo achieve channel bonding of a fiber DSL connection (100 Mbps up/down) with a cable connection (940 Mbps down/40 Mbps up) using Pepwave products, a non-WiFi Pepwave router capable of true packet-level bonding is required. This setup should allow for the combined throughput of both connections without creating a double NAT situation, ensuring that the Google WiFi system remains the DHCP handler. The router must support sufficient throughput to handle the combined speeds, ideally exceeding 1 Gbps for optimal performance.\n\n## Document_36\n\nTo combine a fiber DSL connection of 100 Mbps with a cable connection of 940 Mbps for a total speed of 1 Gbps or more, a Pepwave device capable of packet-level bonding is required. The user seeks a non-WiFi Pepwave router that can achieve this without creating a double NAT situation, allowing their Google WiFi system to remain the DHCP handler. The user is also concerned about throughput, noting that residential-grade Pepwave devices typically offer lower speeds, which may not meet their requirements.\n\n## Document_37\n\nTo combine multiple internet connections effectively, SpeedFusion bonding is required, which allows for the aggregation of bandwidth from different sources. This technology can be used to merge a cable connection with a gigabit download speed and a fiber connection with 100 Mbps download and upload speeds, resulting in a combined throughput that enhances overall internet performance. It is important to ensure that the setup does not create a double NAT situation, which could interfere with network functionality, especially for devices like security cameras and backup servers.\n\n## Document_38\n\nTo combine a fiber DSL connection with a cable connection for increased bandwidth, load balancing can be utilized for high bandwidth traffic, providing session level failover between WAN links. SpeedFusion should be reserved for real-time traffic sensitive to packet loss or latency, such as VoIP. Recommended devices for this setup include the Pepwave Balance Two or the SDX for future 5G integration.\n\n## Document_39\n\nTo combine a DSL fiber connection of 100 Mbps down and up with a cable connection of 940 Mbps down and 40 Mbps up, a Pepwave router that supports load balancing can be used. This setup allows for packet-level distribution of traffic, effectively increasing overall throughput. However, it is important to configure the Pepwave device to avoid handling DHCP requests to maintain the roaming capabilities of a Google mesh Wi-Fi system. Each Google mesh point is hardwired back to a switch, ensuring that they do not rely on wireless connections to each other, which is beneficial for performance.\n\n",

      "The rated throughput of the Peplink MAX BR1 Mini (HW3) is 300 Mbps, which is a theoretical maximum that can be affected by the features enabled on the device. Enabling additional features can reduce the throughput significantly, with some users reporting speeds as low as 50 Mbps when many features are active. For users requiring full 500 Mbps performance, it is recommended to use the Peplink BR1 Pro instead of the Mini model.",
      "When using a Pepwave Max Transit Duo with SpeedFusion bonding, individual cellular connections may perform adequately on their own, but bonding them can be challenging due to fluctuations in cellular speeds and packet sequencing issues. Users have reported difficulties achieving faster download speeds when bonding two cellular connections, although combining them for upload purposes may yield better results. Adjustments to settings such as MTU and WAN Connection Buffer Size have been attempted without significant improvement in overall speed. Additionally, streaming services may be blocked when using a VPN, complicating access for devices like Apple TV.",
      "When using two unlimited AT&T SIM cards in a Pepwave Max Transit Duo with SpeedFusion bonding, users may experience slower speeds than expected due to bandwidth sharing limitations at the cell tower. Testing individual SIM cards and comparing their speeds with a weighted balance outbound policy can help determine the available bandwidth from the location. It is common for bonded speeds to be worse than single connections due to overhead and the maximum available bandwidth to the FusionHub.",
      "To optimize the performance of two AT&T connections on a Pepwave Max Transit Duo, it is recommended to use WAN Analysis to test each connection individually and then together, ensuring they are configured to use the same bands. If the connections do not show similar bandwidth figures when tested individually, it may indicate issues with the tower's handling of the connections. Additionally, the router allows for temporarily pausing a bond member connection based on latency thresholds, which can help improve bonding performance, although it may not fully resolve issues related to latency differences.",
      "It is possible to combine two different speeds of internet connections in Peplink devices using load balancing or SpeedFusion bonding. However, the combined speed will not equal the sum of the two connections (e.g., 80 Mbps) for a single stream due to overhead involved in the process.",
      "To combine a DSL fiber connection with a cable connection for improved overall internet speeds, a combination of load balancing and SpeedFusion technology can be utilized. SpeedFusion allows for the creation of a more reliable connection by aggregating bandwidth from multiple WAN sources. However, it is important to account for overhead, which can reduce effective speeds; for example, a combined upload speed of 140 Mbps may yield around 110 Mbps after accounting for overhead, and a combined download speed of 1000 Mbps may yield around 800 Mbps. Devices requiring a stable connection can be prioritized over SpeedFusion, while other devices can be connected directly to the gigabit WAN to avoid impacting SpeedFusion throughput.",
      "When considering the Pepwave model 380, user recommendations are based on expected active sessions, with the model being suitable for 100-500 users. However, actual user count may not be the only factor; throughput is also critical. For instance, a user with only 55 users found the 380 necessary due to throughput concerns, particularly with an 8/8 synchronous T1 line and two UVerse lines. As internet speeds increase, throughput can become a bottleneck after applying load balancing and firewall policies. The user is considering upgrading to a fiber connection with a potential speed of 50 MB.",

    "answer": "To combine a 940 Mbps cable and a 100 Mbps fiber DSL connection for near-1 Gbps throughput, you need a Pepwave router that supports true packet-level bonding (SpeedFusion) and has sufficient throughput capacity above 1 Gbps. The router should be a non-WiFi model to avoid interfering with your Google WiFi system, which must remain the DHCP handler to prevent double NAT and preserve mesh roaming. However, most residential-grade Pepwave devices have much lower throughput limits and will not support gigabit bonding speeds. Additionally, SpeedFusion introduces bonding overhead (typically 15-30%), so the combined usable bandwidth will be less than the raw sum of the two connections. Configure the Pepwave so it does not handle DHCP, and connect your Google mesh points via wired backhaul for optimal performance. Also, ensure your SpeedFusion license is included or factored into the cost, as it can be expensive if purchased separately.",

This ensures that return traffic comes back on the same link it was sent out on, maintaining the integrity of sessions such as FTP. If an FTP session is established on WAN1, Peplink will consistently route that FTP traffic through WAN1.\n\n## Document_2\n\nTo direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on a Peplink Balance 20/30 series router, an outbound policy rule can be created. This allows for the configuration of traffic routing, ensuring that certain types of traffic, such as FTP, are directed through a designated WAN connection without round-robin switching between multiple WANs.\n\n## Document_3\n\nTo direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on the Peplink Balance 20/30 series, it is important to explore the outbound policy settings rather than inbound rules. The outbound policy allows for the configuration of rules that can route traffic from specific devices or applications to designated WAN connections, ensuring that certain traffic, such as FTP, is consistently routed through the intended WAN without round-robin switching between multiple connections.\n\n## Document_4\n\nPeplink routers balance network traffic between multiple WAN connections based on outbound policy settings. If the default rule is set to auto, traffic distribution occurs on a weighted balance basis, taking into account the downstream bandwidth of each WAN. To achieve better load balancing, it is important to verify the downstream bandwidth settings for each WAN in the web admin page under Network > WAN.\n\n## Document_5\n\nPeplink supports Service Passthroughs, and the 8.1 firmware indicates that SIP Passthrough is always enabled. However, the specific implications of NAT Slipstreaming and whether Peplink devices are vulnerable to this attack are currently being investigated by the engineering team.\n\n## Document_6\n\nTo achieve balanced traffic distribution across two WAN connections on a Peplink Balance 20, the default outbound policy rule, which utilizes the lowest latency algorithm, is generally effective. However, service passthrough support for certain traffic types can override these outbound policy rules and may lead to uneven traffic distribution. Understanding the specific traffic types can assist in configuring the Balance 20 for optimal performance.\n\n## Document_7\n\nIn a Peplink Balance 20 configuration with multiple WAN connections, the default outbound policy should be set to Priority to ensure traffic is routed through the WAN connection with the highest priority that is passing healthchecks. If the policy is set to Lowest Latency, it may not respect the priority order, leading to unexpected data usage on lower priority WANs. Healthchecks should be configured to monitor the connectivity of each WAN, and adjustments to upload and download bandwidth settings can influence which WAN is actively used. Proper configuration of backup priority groups may also be necessary to ensure failover works as intended, with WAN2 acting as a backup to WAN1 and WAN3 as a backup to both.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe Peplink 20 utilizes outbound policies for user requests to websites hosted on the Internet, allowing for return traffic via different WAN connections based on the configured policy. Inbound connections, such as an Internet user accessing a website hosted behind the Peplink, depend on the IP address provided by the DNS server, which determines the specific WAN through which the connection will be established.\n\n## Document_9\n\nIn a Peplink 580 configured in drop-in mode with WAN 1 and an ADSL line on WAN 2, the default outbound policy uses the Lowest Latency algorithm, which may lead to uneven traffic distribution, especially if most traffic is HTTPS and all users are NATTED behind a firewall. This results in traffic being routed through the same WAN until the session ends. For a more balanced distribution of traffic, it is recommended to change the outbound rule algorithm to Weighted Balance.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo configure a Peplink Balance 20 for load balancing and prioritization, use the default Outbound Policy settings with specific adjustments. Set the HTTPS_Persistence Rule to have a custom load distribution with equal weights for WAN1 and WAN2, while others are set to zero. For the Default Rule, use the Overflow algorithm with the order of WAN1, WAN2, and Mobile Internet. Prioritization of traffic can be managed through the QoS settings under Network > QoS > Application, allowing for specific prioritization of email, browsing, Soonr.com, and other traffic types.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Peplink 20 router uses an 'Outbound Policy' under the Network tab to determine which WAN connection is used for outbound traffic. The default policy is 'Least Latency', which selects the WAN with the lowest latency. Users can create protocol-specific rules to prioritize certain types of traffic, such as SIP, and can also modify the default rule to use a weighted policy that utilizes all WAN connections simultaneously.\n\n## Document_12\n\nWhen using a Peplink Balance 20 with two WAN connections, if the combined speed is lower than expected, it may be due to the router defaulting to the slower WAN connection. To optimize performance, users can utilize the custom outbound policy manager to create routing rules, such as weighted balance or priority-based rules, which can help manage how traffic is distributed between the WAN connections.\n\n## Document_13\n\nWhen adding a second WAN connection, such as a fiber 5x5 connection, to a Peplink Balance 20 that is already using a coax cable connection, the outbound policy settings will be crucial. The default Custom rule utilizes the lowest latency algorithm, but users have the flexibility to modify this setting and create custom rules to optimize performance based on their specific needs.\n\n## Document_14\n\nIn firmware v7 of the Pepwave Surf SOHO, the Service Passthrough options include SIP and H.323, which are relevant for use even though the Surf SOHO only supports one WAN connection at a time and primarily functions with WAN failover. The other Service Passthrough options can be ignored in this context.\n\n## Document_15\n\nIn firmware v7 for the Pepwave Surf SOHO, the Service Passthrough options can be left unchanged as the device only supports one active WAN connection at a time, utilizing WAN failover. However, if using IPSec VPN in a multi-WAN environment, disabling the Service Passthrough feature may cause issues, but this is not a concern for the Surf SOHO due to its single active WAN configuration.\n\n## Document_16\n\nPeplink routers support SIP ALG (Application Layer Gateway) across their entire product family, and this feature is enabled by default. Disabling SIP ALG can be done by selecting the 'Compatibility Mode' under Network > Service Passthrough Support > SIP in the Balance Web Admin. SIP ALG facilitates firewall traversal for VoIP services by allowing NAT traversal and rewriting information within SIP messages, which helps maintain address bindings until the session terminates.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on a Peplink Balance 20/30 series router, navigate to the Network settings and set the Outbound Policy to 'Managed by Custom Rules'. Retain the default rules 'HTTPS Persistence' and 'Default', and then add new rules to enforce traffic from specific LAN clients to designated WANs. After creating the rules, ensure to click 'Save' and then 'Apply Changes' to implement them.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Balance 20/30 series allows for the configuration of outbound policy rules to direct specific traffic through designated WAN connections. The default outbound policy rule, set to 'Auto', utilizes a weighted balance algorithm based on the downstream bandwidth of each WAN. Users can customize this setting by changing it to 'Custom' to create specific rules for directing traffic, ensuring that certain machines, such as a server for FTP traffic, can be configured to use only a designated WAN connection without round-robin distribution between multiple WANs.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe issue of uneven traffic distribution between two WAN connections on a Peplink Balance 20 was identified as being caused by SSL traffic being routed exclusively through one WAN connection. Ensuring that traffic is balanced requires checking the routing settings and ensuring that no specific traffic types are inadvertently directed to a single WAN link.\n\n## Document_20\n\nIn a Peplink Balance 20 configuration with multiple WAN connections, the priority algorithm is intended to route traffic through the highest priority healthy WAN connection. However, if WAN1 is set as the highest priority and is healthy, WAN2 and WAN3 should not be actively transmitting data unless WAN1 fails health checks. To achieve the desired failover behavior, it may be necessary to configure WAN2 as Backup Priority Group 1 and WAN3 as Backup Priority Group 2. Additionally, adjusting the upload and download bandwidth settings for each WAN can influence which WAN is actively used, but priority settings should ideally take precedence over bandwidth configurations. If issues persist, opening a support ticket with Peplink is recommended for further investigation.\n\n## Document_21\n\nIn a Peplink 20 router, inbound load balancing is not available, and the selection of which connection to use for inbound traffic depends on the DNS response to queries. The router will choose the link that responds faster, indicating the best connection at that moment. If no port forwarding is configured, the router may drop the connection without further processing.\n\n## Document_22\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 does not perform inbound load balancing; it relies on DNS server responses to determine which WAN connection to use for incoming requests. When a user queries a website with multiple A records, the DNS server decides which IP address to respond with, and the Balance 20 simply processes the incoming connections based on that response. Outbound connections can be load-balanced, but inbound connections are handled on a first-come, first-served basis without any internal selection based on connection speed or bandwidth.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe Peplink 20 does not support inbound load balancing, meaning inbound traffic is handled on a first-come, first-served basis without prioritization based on connection speed or bandwidth. For outbound traffic, users can select from different policies: 'High Application Compatibility' routes all outbound traffic from the same LAN host to the same WAN connection regardless of destination, while 'Normal Application Compatibility' routes traffic from the same LAN host to the same WAN connection for the same destination IP, allowing for WAN link load balancing when accessing multiple servers.\n\n## Document_24\n\nTo configure a Peplink Balance 20 for load balancing with two ADSL connections and a mobile 4G connection, the mobile connection should be set to 'Always On' for the Overflow rule to function correctly. This setup allows the mobile connection to activate when both ADSL lines fail or become saturated, ensuring continuous connectivity.\n\n",

Additionally, adjusting the upload and download bandwidth settings for each WAN can influence which WAN is actively used, but priority settings should ideally take precedence over bandwidth configurations. If issues persist, opening a support ticket with Peplink is recommended for further investigation.",
      "In a Peplink 20 router, inbound load balancing is not available, and the selection of which connection to use for inbound traffic depends on the DNS response to queries. The router will choose the link that responds faster, indicating the best connection at that moment. If no port forwarding is configured, the router may drop the connection without further processing.",
      "The Peplink Balance 20 does not perform inbound load balancing; it relies on DNS server responses to determine which WAN connection to use for incoming requests. When a user queries a website with multiple A records, the DNS server decides which IP address to respond with, and the Balance 20 simply processes the incoming connections based on that response. Outbound connections can be load-balanced, but inbound connections are handled on a first-come, first-served basis without any internal selection based on connection speed or bandwidth.",
      "The Peplink 20 does not support inbound load balancing, meaning inbound traffic is handled on a first-come, first-served basis without prioritization based on connection speed or bandwidth. For outbound traffic, users can select from different policies: 'High Application Compatibility' routes all outbound traffic from the same LAN host to the same WAN connection regardless of destination, while 'Normal Application Compatibility' routes traffic from the same LAN host to the same WAN connection for the same destination IP, allowing for WAN link load balancing when accessing multiple servers.",
      "To configure a Peplink Balance 20 for load balancing with two ADSL connections and a mobile 4G connection, the mobile connection should be set to 'Always On' for the Overflow rule to function correctly. This setup allows the mobile connection to activate when both ADSL lines fail or become saturated, ensuring continuous connectivity."

    "query": "How can a technician use outbound policy rules on the Peplink Balance 20/30 series to ensure specific machines or traffic types (such as FTP) always use a designated WAN connection, and what considerations must be taken to avoid round-robin distribution or session integrity issues?",
    "answer": "To ensure specific machines or traffic types (like FTP) always use a designated WAN connection on a Peplink Balance 20/30 series, a technician should use custom outbound policy rules. This can be done by navigating to the Network settings, setting Outbound Policy to 'Managed by Custom Rules', and adding new rules that direct traffic from specific LAN clients or protocols to the chosen WAN. Retain default rules for HTTPS persistence and general traffic as needed. This setup prevents round-robin distribution and ensures session integrity, such as keeping FTP sessions on the same WAN for both outbound and return traffic. The outbound policy should be used rather than inbound rules, as inbound connections are determined by DNS responses, and the router does not perform inbound load balancing. Additionally, using protocol-specific rules (e.g., for FTP) ensures that particular traffic types are routed consistently, and avoids issues where session-based applications might fail if switched between WANs. After creating the necessary rules, always save and apply changes for them to take effect.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nThe MediaFast 500 supports all 8 load balancing algorithms, contrary to the initial impression that it only supports 7. This indicates that the specifications for the MediaFast family may not be fully representative of its capabilities regarding load balancing algorithms.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe throughput speed of the Peplink Balance 20 is dependent on the hardware revision and the firmware version. The current model supports a throughput of 150 Mbps when on the latest firmware.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a throughput speed that can vary between 100 Mbps and 150 Mbps, which may depend on factors such as firmware or hardware configurations. To verify the actual throughput speed, it is recommended to test the connection directly to the WAN using a PC, rather than through a gigabit rated switch.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe throughput speed of the Peplink Balance 20 can be either 100 Mbps or 150 Mbps, which may depend on the specific hardware version or firmware. The R6 model is expected to achieve the higher throughput of 150 Mbps.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 and 30 models are equipped with a MIPS CPU, 64MB of memory, and 16MB of flash storage. They support a maximum of 3,000 concurrent sessions and have a router throughput performance of 50Mbps. The devices can handle 1,800 new sessions per second and have a mean time between failures (MTBF) of 220,000 hours, making them suitable for 1 to 25 users.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 and 30 routers are rated for 100 Mbps of throughput, which includes both upload and download speeds. They support various types of WAN connections, including Ethernet and USB, although some USB connections may require a firmware update. The Balance series is designed to handle multiple WAN connections, ensuring seamless failover in case one connection drops.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe maximum throughput for the Peplink Balance 30 is 100Mbps, and it is expected to achieve close to this without dropping packets. The device can effectively balance traffic between multiple links, and Peplink offers advanced load balancing algorithms to tailor traffic distribution. While the Balance 30 can meet basic needs, the Balance 380 is recommended for higher throughput and additional enterprise features, such as a built-in PPTP VPN Server.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe Balance 20 router has a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, which can be exceeded by a 500Mbps WAN connection. When a large file download occurs, it can consume all of the router's resources, leading to unresponsiveness and high CPU usage, which is expected behavior for this model. The Balance 20 may not handle high traffic volumes gracefully, and it is suggested that a more capable device, such as the Balance 20X, would be better suited for handling multiple simultaneous activities without performance degradation.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe Balance 20 router has a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, which can be exceeded by a 500Mbps WAN connection, potentially leading to performance issues such as high CPU usage and unresponsiveness during large downloads. Users have reported that actual throughput under real-world conditions can be significantly lower than the advertised specifications, with some suggesting that actual throughput may be about one-third of the raw throughput under ideal conditions. In contrast, other Peplink devices, like the Balance 20X, can achieve higher throughput, with reports of 900+ Mbps on 1Gbps fiber connections.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Balance 20 is rated for 30MBps of IPSEC VPN throughput, while OpenVPN typically has lower performance due to higher CPU overhead. The performance issue experienced with OpenVPN on the Balance 20 may be expected given these limitations. The Balance 20X's specifications regarding multi-CPU/core capabilities are uncertain, but it is suggested that upgrading may improve performance.\n\n## Document_11\n\nIn a network configuration involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 routers connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is important to ensure that outbound rules are correctly set up for traffic to traverse from the satellite sites to Azure. The Balance 508 needs to properly advertise its routes to the connected 305 devices for successful end-to-end connectivity.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe outbound policy configuration on the PepLink Balance 508 was successfully adjusted, allowing the connected Balance 305 devices to traverse to Azure through the established IP Sec VPN tunnels. This indicates that proper routing and policy settings are essential for enabling connectivity between satellite sites and Azure.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Balance 20X can achieve upload speeds averaging around 787 Mbps when tested under certain conditions, such as being connected to a Surf SOHO LAN port. However, users have reported significant discrepancies in upload speeds, with some experiencing only 90-100 Mbps when connected directly to the Balance 20X. This issue may be influenced by factors such as firmware versions, network configuration, and potential hardware limitations like CPU usage during file transfers.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe Balance 20 router is rated for a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, but its VPN throughput with encryption is limited to 30Mbps. In contrast, the Balance 20x model offers a higher VPN throughput of 60Mbps. However, the Balance 20x does not support firmware version 7, which may be a consideration for users experiencing issues with firmware 8. The Balance One is another alternative that can run firmware 7, but its VPN throughput specifications are not published. Users should consider the bandwidth requirements for their VPN connections, as actual throughput will likely be less than the maximum capacity of the internet connection.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Balance 20X router, when running firmware 8.0.1 build 1032, achieves throughput close to its advertised 900Mbps. However, when updated to firmware 8.0.2 build 1045, the WAN to LAN throughput decreases by approximately 300Mbps, resulting in performance similar to or worse than the Balance One, which operates at around 600Mbps with the same firmware. This issue has been consistently observed across multiple tests using common internet speed testing tools.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe Peplink Balance 300, which is approximately 15 years old, supports a maximum throughput of 20Mbps. Therefore, if clients are experiencing a maximum speed of 15Mbps, this is within the expected performance limits of the device, despite having three WAN connections with a total potential speed of 300Mbps.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe Stateful Firewall Throughput of the Peplink Balance 30 Pro is 400 Mbps, which typically refers to the maximum throughput for a single download from WAN to LAN. In a scenario with WAN1 at 250 Mbps up/down and WAN2 at 8 Mbps up/down, the Balance 30 Pro can handle a maximum of 258 Mbps download without issues most of the time. However, if simultaneous full utilization of both WAN connections is expected, a bottleneck may occur. For users with many devices or complex routing needs, the Balance One may be a better option due to its higher throughput capabilities.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe throughput displayed on a Balance device indicates the maximum performance capability of the router, which can vary between models. The Balance 20 has a specified throughput of 150Mbps, which may limit speed tests to around that value, while the Balance 30, which is likely a hardware version 3 with LTE capabilities, shows a throughput of 200Mbps but can achieve higher speed test results, such as 467Mbps. This discrepancy may be due to outdated performance information on the manufacturer's website.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe latest firmware for the Peplink Balance 20W is v4.8.1, and this model has been obsoleted. Users are advised to consider refreshing their router for updated features and support.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe Balance One has a throughput of 600 Mbps, while the Balance 305 has a throughput of 1 Gbps. The Balance One does not support drop-in mode and LAN bypass, which are features available on the Balance 305. Both models support Quality of Service (QoS) for VoIP prioritization, ensuring that voice traffic can be managed effectively in a network environment with multiple users and applications.\n\n## Document_21\n\nThe Balance 30 is rated for a maximum throughput of 150Mbps under ideal conditions. To achieve 1Gbps throughput, a Balance 305 or higher model is required.\n\n## Document_22\n\nThe Balance 30 LTE has a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, which is a hardware limitation that cannot be exceeded. For users needing higher speeds, upgrading to a Balance One or Balance 305 is recommended, and Peplink support can assist in converting the configuration file to the new model.\n\n## Document_23\n\nIf excessive emails about WAN1 connection issues are received after upgrading to a Balance 50 and updating the firmware, it is important to note that the errors in the event log may indicate a physical connection issue rather than health check failures. To potentially resolve this, locking the port speed to 100M Full Duplex is recommended.\n\n## Document_24\n\nThe Peplink Balance e30 is not a DSL modem and does not have RJ11 ports; it only features RJ45 Ethernet ports. To connect the Balance router to an ADSL connection, a separate DSL modem is required that provides an Ethernet output to connect to the Balance's WAN port.\n\n## Document_25\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a bandwidth limit of 100 Mbps, which may be a concern if WAN speeds increase significantly in the future. The device supports PePVPN in the new 6.1 firmware, providing session persistence but lacking WAN aggregation features found in SpeedFusion. The Balance 20 does not offer user or group bandwidth limitations, which may be a drawback for users needing to allocate minimum bandwidth to specific devices. Additionally, the Balance 20 can handle two WAN connections, one with two static IP addresses and another with a dynamic IP, ensuring proper routing to separate LAN devices.\n\n## Document_26\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a router throughput rating of 100 Mbps, which is a limiting factor for the maximum speed experienced when connected through the device. The Balance 20 features 4 Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) LAN ports, but the overall throughput is determined by the router's specifications. Users should consider the total throughput by adding the upload and download speeds of all WAN connections to understand performance limitations.\n\n## Document_27\n\nThe Balance MediaFast family of products supports 7 load balancing algorithms, while the BALANCE family supports 8. The missing algorithm is likely 'fastest response time', which was added most recently. However, it is also possible that the MediaFast reference and datasheets are outdated.\n\n## Document_28\n\nThe Balance 20 and 30 routers have the same technical specifications, with the primary difference being that the Balance 30 includes an additional WAN port. The Balance 210 offers advantages such as support for a greater number of users, a more extensive list of Outbound Load Balancing options (7 options compared to 5 on the 20/30), and increased VPN capabilities not available on the 20 or 30 models. All models support multi-WAN configurations and can accommodate various internet connections including cable, DSL, and 3G/4G.\n\n## Document_29\n\nBoth the Peplink Balance 20 and Balance 30 can be configured for 2 Ethernet connections, while the Balance 30 supports 3 Ethernet connections. Additionally, both models allow for 1 USB 3G/4G connection, which can be set up for backup use through Outbound Policy or WAN status. Users can also implement a bandwidth cap on the USB/Mobile connection to disable it upon reaching a monthly data allowance.\n\n## Document_30\n\nThe Balance 20 router may struggle with high bandwidth connections, such as a 500Mb/sec WAN, leading to performance issues like high CPU usage and unresponsiveness during large downloads. To mitigate this, it is recommended to set the Upload Bandwidth setting for the fiber connection to 120 Mbps to throttle the WAN interface. Additionally, implementing group bandwidth limits can help manage download rates on the client side.\n\n## Document_31\n\nThe Balance 20 router may experience performance issues such as unresponsiveness and high CPU usage during large file downloads, potentially due to Bufferbloat. While Peplink has implemented fq_codel for uploads under the Mitigate Bufferbloat setting, it currently does not support downloads, with a fix expected in version 9. Users can enable the 'DSL cable optimization' feature to prioritize certain types of traffic, which may help improve Bufferbloat performance until the download support is available.\n\n## Document_32\n\nIn a network configuration involving PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is noted that IP Sec tunnels do not typically advertise their routes through second hops. To enable connectivity from satellite sites to Azure, a static route for the Azure subnet can be added on the satellite devices, pointing to the Balance 508. Additionally, firewall configurations on both the satellite sites and Azure may need to be reviewed to ensure they allow the necessary traffic exchange.\n\n## Document_33\n\nTo enable connectivity from PepLink Balance 305 devices to Azure through a Balance 508, static routes can be configured on the Balance 305 for the Azure subnet, using the Balance 508 as the gateway. Additionally, the Azure configuration should include a static route for the Balance 305 subnet, also using the Balance 508 as the gateway. It is important to ensure that firewall rules on both ends permit this routing to function correctly.\n\n## Document_34\n\nIn a network setup involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via a star topology, issues may arise with route advertisement to Azure through IP Sec VPN tunnels. The Balance 508 may not be advertising its routes to the connected Balance 305 devices, which can prevent satellite sites from accessing Azure. Additionally, static routes may need to connect to gateways within the same subnet, which can complicate configurations if sites are not willing to share a common subnet.\n\n## Document_35\n\nTo address slow upload speeds on a Balance 20X, it is recommended to check the WAN connection settings under Network > WAN and ensure that the values are set according to the actual ISP specifications. These settings may affect traffic prioritization, which could potentially impact upload speeds.\n\n## Document_36\n\nIn a Balance 20X configuration, the upload and download bandwidth settings are used primarily for the overflow outbound policy algorithm, which helps the device understand when a link is saturated. These settings do not limit throughput; for example, even if the upload bandwidth is set to 10 Mbps, the device can still achieve up to 900 Mbps download speeds. Therefore, the observed upload speed drop from a direct connection to the Balance 20X may not be related to these settings.\n\n## Document_37\n\nWhen testing internet speeds on a Balance 20X, users should check the real-time bandwidth display in the router's Status tab to monitor performance. If experiencing significantly lower upload speeds compared to download speeds, it may be beneficial to try multiple speed testing websites, as the results can vary based on the testing site used.\n\n## Document_38\n\nWhen experiencing significantly slower upload speeds on a Peplink Balance 20X compared to download speeds, it is suggested to test the router after a factory reset. Additionally, testing with another router can help determine if the issue lies with the Balance 20X. If another router achieves upload speeds above 100 Mbps, it may indicate a problem with the Balance 20X itself. When connecting the Balance 20X behind another router, ensure that it does not use the same subnet address to avoid routing issues.\n\n## Document_39\n\nThe Balance 20X can exhibit significantly slower upload speeds compared to download speeds, with reported upload speeds dropping to 90-100 Mbps while download speeds can reach up to 900 Mbps. Testing different firmware versions revealed that firmware 8.0.2 build 1045 resulted in improved upload speeds of ~400 Mbps, while reverting to firmware 8.1.0 build 4938 returned upload speeds to the original low levels. This suggests that the issue may be related to the software version being used.\n\n",

      "In a network configuration involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 routers connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is important to ensure that outbound rules are correctly set up for traffic to traverse from the satellite sites to Azure. The Balance 508 needs to properly advertise its routes to the connected 305 devices for successful end-to-end connectivity.",
      "The outbound policy configuration on the PepLink Balance 508 was successfully adjusted, allowing the connected Balance 305 devices to traverse to Azure through the established IP Sec VPN tunnels. This indicates that proper routing and policy settings are essential for enabling connectivity between satellite sites and Azure.",
      "The Balance 20X can achieve upload speeds averaging around 787 Mbps when tested under certain conditions, such as being connected to a Surf SOHO LAN port. However, users have reported significant discrepancies in upload speeds, with some experiencing only 90-100 Mbps when connected directly to the Balance 20X. This issue may be influenced by factors such as firmware versions, network configuration, and potential hardware limitations like CPU usage during file transfers.",
      "The Balance 20 router is rated for a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, but its VPN throughput with encryption is limited to 30Mbps. In contrast, the Balance 20x model offers a higher VPN throughput of 60Mbps. However, the Balance 20x does not support firmware version 7, which may be a consideration for users experiencing issues with firmware 8. The Balance One is another alternative that can run firmware 7, but its VPN throughput specifications are not published. Users should consider the bandwidth requirements for their VPN connections, as actual throughput will likely be less than the maximum capacity of the internet connection.",
      "The Balance 20X router, when running firmware 8.0.1 build 1032, achieves throughput close to its advertised 900Mbps. However, when updated to firmware 8.0.2 build 1045, the WAN to LAN throughput decreases by approximately 300Mbps, resulting in performance similar to or worse than the Balance One, which operates at around 600Mbps with the same firmware. This issue has been consistently observed across multiple tests using common internet speed testing tools.",
      "The Peplink Balance 300, which is approximately 15 years old, supports a maximum throughput of 20Mbps. Therefore, if clients are experiencing a maximum speed of 15Mbps, this is within the expected performance limits of the device, despite having three WAN connections with a total potential speed of 300Mbps.",
      "The Stateful Firewall Throughput of the Peplink Balance 30 Pro is 400 Mbps, which typically refers to the maximum throughput for a single download from WAN to LAN. In a scenario with WAN1 at 250 Mbps up/down and WAN2 at 8 Mbps up/down, the Balance 30 Pro can handle a maximum of 258 Mbps download without issues most of the time. However, if simultaneous full utilization of both WAN connections is expected, a bottleneck may occur. For users with many devices or complex routing needs, the Balance One may be a better option due to its higher throughput capabilities.",
      "The throughput displayed on a Balance device indicates the maximum performance capability of the router, which can vary between models. The Balance 20 has a specified throughput of 150Mbps, which may limit speed tests to around that value, while the Balance 30, which is likely a hardware version 3 with LTE capabilities, shows a throughput of 200Mbps but can achieve higher speed test results, such as 467Mbps. This discrepancy may be due to outdated performance information on the manufacturer's website.",
      "The latest firmware for the Peplink Balance 20W is v4.8.1, and this model has been obsoleted. Users are advised to consider refreshing their router for updated features and support.",
      "The Balance One has a throughput of 600 Mbps, while the Balance 305 has a throughput of 1 Gbps. The Balance One does not support drop-in mode and LAN bypass, which are features available on the Balance 305. Both models support Quality of Service (QoS) for VoIP prioritization, ensuring that voice traffic can be managed effectively in a network environment with multiple users and applications.",
      "The Balance 30 is rated for a maximum throughput of 150Mbps under ideal conditions. To achieve 1Gbps throughput, a Balance 305 or higher model is required.",
      "The Balance 30 LTE has a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, which is a hardware limitation that cannot be exceeded. For users needing higher speeds, upgrading to a Balance One or Balance 305 is recommended, and Peplink support can assist in converting the configuration file to the new model.",
      "If excessive emails about WAN1 connection issues are received after upgrading to a Balance 50 and updating the firmware, it is important to note that the errors in the event log may indicate a physical connection issue rather than health check failures. To potentially resolve this, locking the port speed to 100M Full Duplex is recommended.",
      "The Peplink Balance e30 is not a DSL modem and does not have RJ11 ports; it only features RJ45 Ethernet ports. To connect the Balance router to an ADSL connection, a separate DSL modem is required that provides an Ethernet output to connect to the Balance's WAN port.",
      "The Peplink Balance 20 has a bandwidth limit of 100 Mbps, which may be a concern if WAN speeds increase significantly in the future. The device supports PePVPN in the new 6.1 firmware, providing session persistence but lacking WAN aggregation features found in SpeedFusion. The Balance 20 does not offer user or group bandwidth limitations, which may be a drawback for users needing to allocate minimum bandwidth to specific devices. Additionally, the Balance 20 can handle two WAN connections, one with two static IP addresses and another with a dynamic IP, ensuring proper routing to separate LAN devices.",
      "The Peplink Balance 20 has a router throughput rating of 100 Mbps, which is a limiting factor for the maximum speed experienced when connected through the device. The Balance 20 features 4 Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) LAN ports, but the overall throughput is determined by the router's specifications. Users should consider the total throughput by adding the upload and download speeds of all WAN connections to understand performance limitations.",
      "The Balance MediaFast family of products supports 7 load balancing algorithms, while the BALANCE family supports 8. The missing algorithm is likely 'fastest response time', which was added most recently. However, it is also possible that the MediaFast reference and datasheets are outdated.",
      "The Balance 20 and 30 routers have the same technical specifications, with the primary difference being that the Balance 30 includes an additional WAN port. The Balance 210 offers advantages such as support for a greater number of users, a more extensive list of Outbound Load Balancing options (7 options compared to 5 on the 20/30), and increased VPN capabilities not available on the 20 or 30 models. All models support multi-WAN configurations and can accommodate various internet connections including cable, DSL, and 3G/4G.",
      "Both the Peplink Balance 20 and Balance 30 can be configured for 2 Ethernet connections, while the Balance 30 supports 3 Ethernet connections. Additionally, both models allow for 1 USB 3G/4G connection, which can be set up for backup use through Outbound Policy or WAN status. Users can also implement a bandwidth cap on the USB/Mobile connection to disable it upon reaching a monthly data allowance.",
      "The Balance 20 router may struggle with high bandwidth connections, such as a 500Mb/sec WAN, leading to performance issues like high CPU usage and unresponsiveness during large downloads. To mitigate this, it is recommended to set the Upload Bandwidth setting for the fiber connection to 120 Mbps to throttle the WAN interface. Additionally, implementing group bandwidth limits can help manage download rates on the client side.",
      "The Balance 20 router may experience performance issues such as unresponsiveness and high CPU usage during large file downloads, potentially due to Bufferbloat. While Peplink has implemented fq_codel for uploads under the Mitigate Bufferbloat setting, it currently does not support downloads, with a fix expected in version 9. Users can enable the 'DSL cable optimization' feature to prioritize certain types of traffic, which may help improve Bufferbloat performance until the download support is available.",
      "In a network configuration involving PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is noted that IP Sec tunnels do not typically advertise their routes through second hops. To enable connectivity from satellite sites to Azure, a static route for the Azure subnet can be added on the satellite devices, pointing to the Balance 508. Additionally, firewall configurations on both the satellite sites and Azure may need to be reviewed to ensure they allow the necessary traffic exchange.",
      "To enable connectivity from PepLink Balance 305 devices to Azure through a Balance 508, static routes can be configured on the Balance 305 for the Azure subnet, using the Balance 508 as the gateway. Additionally, the Azure configuration should include a static route for the Balance 305 subnet, also using the Balance 508 as the gateway. It is important to ensure that firewall rules on both ends permit this routing to function correctly.",
      "In a network setup involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via a star topology, issues may arise with route advertisement to Azure through IP Sec VPN tunnels. The Balance 508 may not be advertising its routes to the connected Balance 305 devices, which can prevent satellite sites from accessing Azure. Additionally, static routes may need to connect to gateways within the same subnet, which can complicate configurations if sites are not willing to share a common subnet.",
      "To address slow upload speeds on a Balance 20X, it is recommended to check the WAN connection settings under Network > WAN and ensure that the values are set according to the actual ISP specifications. These settings may affect traffic prioritization, which could potentially impact upload speeds.",
      "In a Balance 20X configuration, the upload and download bandwidth settings are used primarily for the overflow outbound policy algorithm, which helps the device understand when a link is saturated. These settings do not limit throughput; for example, even if the upload bandwidth is set to 10 Mbps, the device can still achieve up to 900 Mbps download speeds. Therefore, the observed upload speed drop from a direct connection to the Balance 20X may not be related to these settings.",
      "When testing internet speeds on a Balance 20X, users should check the real-time bandwidth display in the router's Status tab to monitor performance. If experiencing significantly lower upload speeds compared to download speeds, it may be beneficial to try multiple speed testing websites, as the results can vary based on the testing site used.",
      "When experiencing significantly slower upload speeds on a Peplink Balance 20X compared to download speeds, it is suggested to test the router after a factory reset. Additionally, testing with another router can help determine if the issue lies with the Balance 20X. If another router achieves upload speeds above 100 Mbps, it may indicate a problem with the Balance 20X itself. When connecting the Balance 20X behind another router, ensure that it does not use the same subnet address to avoid routing issues.",
      "The Balance 20X can exhibit significantly slower upload speeds compared to download speeds, with reported upload speeds dropping to 90-100 Mbps while download speeds can reach up to 900 Mbps. Testing different firmware versions revealed that firmware 8.0.2 build 1045 resulted in improved upload speeds of ~400 Mbps, while reverting to firmware 8.1.0 build 4938 returned upload speeds to the original low levels. This suggests that the issue may be related to the software version being used."
    ],
    "query": "What factors can cause the Peplink Balance 20X to exhibit significantly lower upload speeds than download speeds, and what troubleshooting steps can a technician take to identify and address the issue?",
    "answer": "Several factors can cause the Peplink Balance 20X to show much lower upload speeds compared to download speeds. These include improper WAN connection settings, firmware version differences, network configuration issues (such as conflicting subnets), and possibly traffic prioritization or router hardware problems. To troubleshoot, a technician should first verify that the WAN connection settings match the ISP's specifications, as incorrect values can affect prioritization. Next, testing with different firmware versions is important, since some firmware builds (like 8.0.2 build 1045) have shown to improve upload speeds while others (such as 8.1.0 build 4938) may reduce them. Monitoring real-time bandwidth in the router's status tab and running tests using multiple speed test sites is also recommended, as results may vary. Performing a factory reset of the router and testing upload speeds again can help isolate configuration issues. If another router achieves higher upload speeds on the same connection, this may indicate a hardware or specific software issue with the Balance 20X. Ensuring that there are no subnet conflicts when testing behind another router is also important.",

This indicates that the specifications for the MediaFast family may not be fully representative of its capabilities regarding load balancing algorithms.\n\n## Document_2\n\nWhen testing LTE modules, a Cat4 and a Cat12 module can each cap at 100mbps individually. To potentially achieve higher speeds, it is important to ensure that SpeedFusion is not limiting performance. Using a Cat18 flex module in a Peplink Balance 20X can yield speeds over 100mbps, suggesting that upgrading to a higher category module may improve performance significantly.\n\n## Document_3\n\nTo replace MPLS with Peplink appliances using SpeedFusion, it is possible to create two SpeedFusion tunnels: one to the HQ site and another to the Disaster Recovery (DR) site. A priority-based outbound policy rule should be established at the remote sites to route all traffic through the SpeedFusion tunnel, with the HQ site set as Priority 1 and the DR site as Priority 2. This configuration ensures that all traffic is directed to the HQ unless it is down, in which case traffic will reroute to the DR site. This setup is straightforward to configure and effective for maintaining connectivity.\n\n## Document_4\n\nIt is possible to use the same Peplink appliance at the HQ site to build SpeedFusion links with remote sites while also routing internet traffic through a firewall for security checks. The configuration should ensure that all flows from remote sites are received via SpeedFusion links, and when internet access is required, the traffic should be directed to the firewall for rule enforcement before being routed back to the Peplink appliance for internet access, avoiding direct internet access from remote sites. Utilizing drop-in mode and force routing on the firewall may be effective strategies for this setup, while also ensuring that a backup site is available for disaster recovery purposes.\n\n## Document_5\n\nTo disable TLS 1.0 on a Pepwave Balance One running the latest firmware, change the PepVPN Backward Compatibility settings to 'Restricted (firmware 6.2+)' in the Speedfusion section of the Web Admin Interface. This setting enforces the use of TLS v1.2. Additionally, for SSL certificates, it is important to obtain the certificate for the domain name associated with the web site and email server to avoid issues. Weak ciphers should also be addressed in the security settings of the router.\n\n## Document_6\n\nTo address PCI compliance issues with a Peplink Balance 20s, it may be necessary to disable older cyphers such as TLS V1.0. This can be done by disabling backwards compatibility with older firmware revisions for PepVPN in the PepVPN/SpeedFusion Settings Page.\n\n## Document_7\n\nTo address PCI compliance issues related to TLS v1.0 on a Pepwave Balance router, it is necessary to disable TLS v1.0. However, the option to change compatibility settings may be greyed out when PepVPN is enabled. Disabling PepVPN allows for the change to be made, but re-enabling it may revert the settings. Users should ensure they are on the latest firmware versions, as compatibility and security features can vary between builds.\n\n## Document_8\n\nIn a Peplink routing environment, the default cost of learned SpeedFusion routes is set to 10000. Route prioritization can be managed through the outbound policy settings, where enabling expert mode allows users to prioritize a specific path over SpeedFusion connections. This can be useful when injecting OSPF prefixes into a full mesh topology to indicate preferred routes.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe Balance MediaFast family of products supports 7 load balancing algorithms, while the BALANCE family supports 8. The missing algorithm is likely 'fastest response time', which was added most recently. However, it is also possible that the MediaFast reference and datasheets are outdated.\n\n## Document_10\n\nWhen testing LTE modules, a user has replaced a CAT4 module with a CAT12 and also has a CAT6 flex module, but is unable to achieve speeds greater than 100 Mbps individually, despite the modules being capable of over 200 Mbps on other devices with the same band selection. The user has attempted various configurations, including deleting all algorithms except SSL with a 1:1 balance and using a balance of 5:3, but has not seen improvements in speed testing results.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe FlexModule Mini in the Peplink Balance 20X has a maximum throughput of about 150Mbps due to its shared bus architecture. This may limit performance when used alongside the internal 4G module and USB port. The Wired WAN on the Balance 20X can provide up to 900Mbps of throughput. For optimal performance with FlexModule Mini modules, a Balance 380X or 580X is required.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe FlexModule Mini in the Peplink Balance 20X has a maximum throughput of about 150Mbps due to its shared bus architecture. This may affect the overall speed when used in conjunction with the internal 4G module and the USB port of the device, potentially limiting the speed to 100Mbps when testing with multiple LTE modules.\n\n",

The configuration should ensure that all flows from remote sites are received via SpeedFusion links, and when internet access is required, the traffic should be directed to the firewall for rule enforcement before being routed back to the Peplink appliance for internet access, avoiding direct internet access from remote sites. Utilizing drop-in mode and force routing on the firewall may be effective strategies for this setup, while also ensuring that a backup site is available for disaster recovery purposes.",
      "To disable TLS 1.0 on a Pepwave Balance One running the latest firmware, change the PepVPN Backward Compatibility settings to 'Restricted (firmware 6.2+)' in the Speedfusion section of the Web Admin Interface. This setting enforces the use of TLS v1.2. Additionally, for SSL certificates, it is important to obtain the certificate for the domain name associated with the web site and email server to avoid issues. Weak ciphers should also be addressed in the security settings of the router.",
      "To address PCI compliance issues with a Peplink Balance 20s, it may be necessary to disable older cyphers such as TLS V1.0. This can be done by disabling backwards compatibility with older firmware revisions for PepVPN in the PepVPN/SpeedFusion Settings Page.",
      "To address PCI compliance issues related to TLS v1.0 on a Pepwave Balance router, it is necessary to disable TLS v1.0. However, the option to change compatibility settings may be greyed out when PepVPN is enabled. Disabling PepVPN allows for the change to be made, but re-enabling it may revert the settings. Users should ensure they are on the latest firmware versions, as compatibility and security features can vary between builds.",
      "In a Peplink routing environment, the default cost of learned SpeedFusion routes is set to 10000. Route prioritization can be managed through the outbound policy settings, where enabling expert mode allows users to prioritize a specific path over SpeedFusion connections. This can be useful when injecting OSPF prefixes into a full mesh topology to indicate preferred routes.",
      "The Balance MediaFast family of products supports 7 load balancing algorithms, while the BALANCE family supports 8. The missing algorithm is likely 'fastest response time', which was added most recently. However, it is also possible that the MediaFast reference and datasheets are outdated.",
      "When testing LTE modules, a user has replaced a CAT4 module with a CAT12 and also has a CAT6 flex module, but is unable to achieve speeds greater than 100 Mbps individually, despite the modules being capable of over 200 Mbps on other devices with the same band selection. The user has attempted various configurations, including deleting all algorithms except SSL with a 1:1 balance and using a balance of 5:3, but has not seen improvements in speed testing results.",
      "The FlexModule Mini in the Peplink Balance 20X has a maximum throughput of about 150Mbps due to its shared bus architecture. This may limit performance when used alongside the internal 4G module and USB port. The Wired WAN on the Balance 20X can provide up to 900Mbps of throughput. For optimal performance with FlexModule Mini modules, a Balance 380X or 580X is required.",
      "The FlexModule Mini in the Peplink Balance 20X has a maximum throughput of about 150Mbps due to its shared bus architecture.

    "query": "How does the FlexModule Mini's shared bus architecture in the Peplink Balance 20X affect LTE speed testing, and what steps can be taken to achieve speeds above 100 Mbps with various LTE modules?",
    "answer": "The FlexModule Mini in the Peplink Balance 20X has a shared bus architecture, which limits its maximum throughput to about 150Mbps. This limitation can impact speed testing, especially when using the FlexModule Mini together with the internal 4G module or the USB port, sometimes resulting in observed speeds being capped at or below 100Mbps, even if higher-category LTE modules (Cat4, Cat6, Cat12) are used. Upgrading to a Cat18 FlexModule can allow for speeds above 100Mbps, but to fully leverage the higher speeds, it is recommended to use the Balance 380X or 580X, which do not have the same shared bus limitations as the Balance 20X. Additionally, ensure that SpeedFusion is not limiting performance during testing.",

This can be done by inserting a small screwdriver or pin into the fan slot while the unit is unplugged, then powering the unit on. If successful, the unit should beep twice and then boot. However, this method is not recommended for continued use, as the device may have underlying issues such as a corrupt compact flash, a faulty IC chip, or a bad fan/rpm sensor.\n\n## Document_32\n\nTo reset the configuration of a Pepwave Balance 580 that is stuck in the initializing phase, one possible method is to open the device and remove the flash memory. This should be done in consultation with the repair facility before sending the device for service.\n\n## Document_33\n\nTo attempt to reset the configuration of a Peplink Balance 580 that is stuck in the initializing phase, one option is to connect a USB keyboard to the device's USB port and press F1 when it fails to boot. This method may help in accessing recovery options or resetting the device.\n\n## Document_34\n\nIn a Pepwave BR1 setup with two separate provider SIMs installed and both ports enabled, if the service is EV-DO only, SIM cards are not used for authentication, and the MEID is utilized instead. There is currently no automatic failover capability from HSPA to EV-DO, necessitating a manual change to switch between the two SIMs in case of a connection loss.\n\n## Document_35\n\nTo schedule a regular reboot for a Pepwave Surf SOHO, users can do so via InControl by navigating to Settings -> Device System Management and enabling the 'Scheduled Reboot - Managed' option, allowing for daily or weekly scheduling. Alternatively, users can access the device's LAN IP address, modify the URL to include 'support.cgi', and find the option to schedule a daily or weekly reboot on that page.\n\n## Document_36\n\nTo address issues with a Surf SOHO locking up, it is suggested to install firmware version 7.1.1 and set a daily reboot schedule to maintain stability. Problems may arise when multiple devices connect to the 2.4GHz band, leading to connectivity issues where the OpenReach light stays solid amber, indicating a loss of connection. A power cycle of the router is required to restore functionality. It is also inquired whether there is any logging capability on the Surf SOHO to diagnose the connectivity issues.\n\n## Document_37\n\nTo address regular lockups of the Surf SOHO, it is suggested to consider configurations involving multiple VLANs and SSIDs, as the original configuration only has one SSID. Testing with a configuration that mimics a more complex setup may help identify issues over an extended period. Additionally, internal logs could provide insights into the cause of the lockups, although access to these logs is not available in this context.\n\n## Document_38\n\nThe Surf SOHO router may experience lockups, particularly after firmware version 7.1.1, leading to issues with wireless connectivity while wired devices remain functional. Users have reported that the router runs warm to hot during operation, which may indicate overheating or excessive processing. A hard power cycle temporarily resolves the issue, and rolling back to an earlier firmware version is suggested as a potential solution until a new firmware update is available.\n\n",

      "To address regular lockups of the Surf SOHO, it is suggested to consider configurations involving multiple VLANs and SSIDs, as the original configuration only has one SSID. Testing with a configuration that mimics a more complex setup may help identify issues over an extended period. Additionally, internal logs could provide insights into the cause of the lockups, although access to these logs is not available in this context.",
      "The Surf SOHO router may experience lockups, particularly after firmware version 7.1.1, leading to issues with wireless connectivity while wired devices remain functional. Users have reported that the router runs warm to hot during operation, which may indicate overheating or excessive processing. A hard power cycle temporarily resolves the issue, and rolling back to an earlier firmware version is suggested as a potential solution until a new firmware update is available."

    "query": "What are the recommended approaches for regaining or resetting admin access to Pepwave and Peplink devices (such as Surf SOHO, MAX BR1, and Balance series) without losing configuration, and what options are available if all else fails?",
    "answer": "To regain or reset admin access to Pepwave and Peplink devices without losing configuration, first check if device management through InControl2 is available. InControl2 allows you to retrieve or reset the admin password for devices like Surf SOHO, MAX BR1, and Balance 20 by revealing the last known password or resetting it remotely. Alternatively, if a secondary admin account exists, it can be used to reset the primary admin password (as on Balance Two). For the Surf Soho mk3, the web admin credentials can be reset to 'admin/admin' using InControl2 without erasing the configuration. If InControl2 is not available and no secondary admin exists, a hardware reset is required, which will erase the configuration. Factory resets can be performed by holding the reset button for 20–30 seconds (device-dependent). If the device is unresponsive or stuck in a boot loop (e.g., Balance 580), advanced recovery methods such as using a console cable, USB keyboard, or removing flash memory may be attempted before sending the device for repair.",

Using a WiFi analyzer app can help identify congested channels. Manually setting the AP channel to an unused number may resolve the issue. After confirming the broadcast, it is recommended to switch the channel back to 'auto' and ensure all channels are selected for use, with Auto Channel Update set to check every hour without waiting for active clients. If problems persist, resetting the Pepwave device may help it select a new channel, and disabling the 2.4G WAN until a signal is established can also be beneficial.\n\n## Document_2\n\nTo set up simultaneous Wi-Fi as WAN and Wi-Fi AP on a Pepwave router, first enable the Wi-Fi WAN connection by renaming it and setting its priority to 1 in the WAN Connection Status tab. Then, select the desired Wi-Fi network to connect to as WAN and enter the password. Next, create a new SSID under the AP tab, configure its security settings, and choose the desired frequency bands (2.4GHz and/or 5GHz) for the SSID. Save and apply changes to complete the setup.\n\n## Document_3\n\nOn select Max Transit models running Firmware 7, it is possible to define two Wi-Fi-as-WAN connections using both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands simultaneously, allowing for load balancing when both connections are placed in the same connection priority. To set this up, users must create a Wi-Fi WAN connection for both frequencies, ensuring they are assigned the same priority in the WAN Connection Status tab. However, a noted issue is that if the Wi-Fi WAN network goes down, the Wi-Fi LAN on the same frequency may experience significant packet loss due to the router's frequent scanning for the WAN network. A suggested improvement is to lower the scan interval to reduce packet loss during WAN disconnection events.\n\n## Document_4\n\nOn select Max Transit models running Firmware 7, it is possible to define two Wi-Fi-as-WAN connections using both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands simultaneously when placed in the same connection priority.

    "query": "How can you configure a Pepwave MAX Transit running Firmware 7 to achieve simultaneous load-balanced Wi-Fi-as-WAN using both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, and what are the potential issues and troubleshooting steps if the Wi-Fi AP fails to broadcast correctly when also using Wi-Fi as WAN?",
    "answer": "To configure a Pepwave MAX Transit running Firmware 7 for simultaneous load-balanced Wi-Fi-as-WAN on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, you must create two Wi-Fi WAN connections—one for each frequency—and set both to the same connection priority (typically Priority 1) in the WAN Connection Status on the dashboard. This enables load balancing between the two Wi-Fi WAN sources. After setting up WAN, you can also create a Wi-Fi AP by defining a new SSID in the AP tab, setting security, and specifying which bands (2.4GHz and/or 5GHz) the AP should use. \n\nIf the Wi-Fi AP fails to broadcast correctly, especially when also using Wi-Fi as WAN, channel interference or network scanning may be the cause. Troubleshooting steps include: disabling the 2.4GHz WAN to check if the AP broadcasts on 2.4GHz, using a Wi-Fi analyzer to identify congested channels, manually setting the AP to an unused channel, and then returning to 'auto' channel selection. For persistent issues, resetting the device or temporarily disabling the 2.4GHz WAN until a stable signal is established may help. Additionally, note that if the Wi-Fi WAN network goes down, the LAN AP on the same band may experience packet loss due to frequent WAN scanning; reducing the scan interval can mitigate this.",

If the device continues to use the original port for handshaking, it is recommended to open a support ticket for further assistance.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe Pepwave Sure SOHO MK3 is experiencing connectivity issues with the 2.4 GHz SSID, which connects for a few hours before stopping connections, while the 5 GHz SSID remains accessible. The issue appears to be related to firmware version 8.0.0, as the device operates normally on firmware version 7.1.0. The problem may not affect all devices connecting to the 2.4 GHz network, indicating that it could be device-specific.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe PepWave Surf Soho does not support the IPSEC VPN feature, which is necessary for setting up a point-to-point IPSEC tunnel with a Cisco RV345 router. For detailed specifications, users can refer to the official Pepwave website.\n\n## Document_5\n\nIf experiencing DHCP errors on a Pepwave Surf SOHO V2, it is suggested to check if more than 254 unique devices have connected to the network within 24 hours. If this is the case, changing the subnet from /24 to /16 and adjusting the DHCP lease time from 1 day to 10 minutes can help. The DHCP range should be set to 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.2.254. After 24 hours, if the issue is resolved, the settings can be reverted back to /24.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe issue with the Pepwave Surf SOHO V2 was caused by a video access point (VAP) for Bell Fibe television that was making continuous DHCP requests, leading to errors. The problem was resolved by resetting the VAP and placing it on its own dedicated network, which eliminated the interference with DHCP services.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe device in the photo is identified as the Pepwave HDX, which has not yet been publicly released and was previously seen only in development stages.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe maximum throughput for the Pepwave Surf SOHO T router is 120 Mbps, which explains why a speed test through the SOHO shows 95 Mbps, as it is operating within its specified limits. The difference in speed between the internet router and the SOHO is not indicative of a malfunction but rather a result of the router's maximum capacity.\n\n## Document_9\n\nTo resolve authentication issues with the PEPWAVE_SOHO Wi-Fi network, ensure that the security policy is set to WPA/WPA2 - Personal in the security settings. Additionally, reset the wireless SSID pre-shared key and delete any related Wi-Fi profiles on the mobile device before re-associating with the Surf Soho Wi-Fi access point.\n\n## Document_10\n\nA Pepwave Soho can connect to two Pepwave Sohos via VPN.\n\n## Document_11\n\nTo prevent connection drops on devices like a MacBook Pro and iPad when using a Pepwave Surf Moho with a Verizon JetPack, ensure that the WAN links have exclusive IP networks, meaning that both WANs should not share the same address (e.g., 192.168.1.1). Additionally, the LAN network should not overlap with any of the WAN networks to maintain proper connectivity.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo resolve issues with a PepWave Surf OTG not obtaining an IP address via DHCP from a Verizon Jetpack MiFi 6620L, performing a factory reset on the Surf OTG is recommended. If the problem persists, opening a support ticket for further investigation may be necessary.\n\n## Document_13\n\nWith a Pepwave device, it is possible to see the MAC addresses of users connected to the network and to block BitTorrent traffic using the Content Blocking feature.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo set up port forwarding on a Peplink device, it is possible to configure incoming connections on one port (e.g., 5010) and forward them to another port (e.g., 3389 for RDP). This allows multiple users to connect through a specified port while being directed to their respective machines via their IP addresses on port 3389.\n\n## Document_15\n\nIt is possible to connect a HD4 in Group A with Group B that has a SpeedFusion Balance 380.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo create a segregated network using a spare Balance 580, connect the WAN port of the second Balance 580 to a switch that is connected to the LAN port of the primary Balance 580. This setup allows the second Balance 580 to manage its own LAN, which will be isolated from the devices on the LAN of the primary Balance 580 due to NAT configurations on the second device.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo manage BitTorrent traffic on a Pepwave model 30, Application QoS can be used to prioritize critical traffic over BitTorrent. Users can configure this under Network > QoS > Application. It is necessary to identify the ports used by BitTorrent to create a custom rule, and while it is possible to set a low priority for BitTorrent, it may be required to define higher priority rules for other types of traffic as well. The default priority for unspecified traffic is assumed to be normal. For more robust filtering and firewall capabilities, a separate network device designed for Unified Threat Management (UTM) may be recommended.\n\n## Document_18\n\nTo manage BitTorrent traffic on a Pepwave model 30, Application QoS can be configured to prioritize other critical traffic over BitTorrent. Users can set the priority of applications to Low, Normal, or High under Network > Application > QoS, with any undefined traffic defaulting to Normal priority. While there are no upgrades available for better filtering of BitTorrent traffic, bandwidth limits can be set for specific clients or endpoints to mitigate the impact of BitTorrent users on overall bandwidth. Third-party software or devices are recommended for more effective content filtering.\n\n## Document_19\n\nTo manage BitTorrent traffic on the Pepwave model 30, Application QoS can be configured to prioritize critical traffic over BitTorrent. Users can create a custom rule to set BitTorrent traffic to low priority, but it is not necessary to define rules for all other types of traffic unless desired. The default priority for unspecified traffic is assumed to be normal. There are discussions about the limitations of the current firewall capabilities and the potential for improved application filtering in future updates.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe HD4 device experienced connectivity issues with Orange in France due to an incorrect APN setting. The device was stuck on 'obtaining IP address' because the APN was set to 'orange.fr' instead of the correct 'orange'. After manually entering the correct APN, the device was able to connect immediately. The APN list for automatic selection is being updated to reflect this correction.\n\n## Document_21\n\nThe Peplink HD4 currently supports only 2 WAN connections and does not offer a license upgrade to enable additional WAN ports, unlike the Peplink Balancer One which has a license feature for 5 WAN ports.\n\n## Document_22\n\nTo access the admin page of a PepWave Surf SOHO MK3 after changing the admin port, ensure that the full IP address is used in the correct format, which includes the IP address, a colon, and the new port number without any spaces. The default IP address is 192.168.50.1.\n\n## Document_23\n\nTo configure WiFi on a Pepwave Soho router, users should check the AP tab where WiFi settings are located, which is enabled by default. If WiFi is not functioning, it may be turned off for the entire router, which can be verified on the main dashboard page of the router's interface.\n\n## Document_24\n\nTo troubleshoot connectivity issues between a Pepwave Surf SoHo router and an iPhone, it is suggested to check the firmware version of the Surf SoHo device. Additionally, changing the iPhone's name to a simpler name, which is used as the SSID, may help in isolating the issue.\n\n## Document_25\n\nThe Pepwave Surf Solo firmware 6.3.2 supports 802.11ng as the default Wi-Fi standard, which allows connections from devices using 802.11b and 802.11g. The option for 802.11na is available, but it is only applicable if all devices are compatible with the 5GHz frequency. Therefore, the 50 Mbps cable connection should work with the Pepwave Surf Solo as long as the connected devices are compatible with the supported Wi-Fi standards.\n\n## Document_26\n\nTo use a Pepwave GTO to provide an Ethernet port for a non-wireless enabled laptop via a Verizon Jetpack 4G LTE, the GTO should be set up in Cellular Mode on the dashboard. Additionally, the Jetpack must be configured in tethered mode before connecting it to the GTO. Checking the dashboard for messages after connecting the Jetpack can help diagnose any issues.\n\n## Document_27\n\nThe Pepwave Sure SOHO MK3 is experiencing connectivity issues with its 2.4 GHz SSID, where devices can connect for a few hours before losing the ability to connect, although the SSID remains visible. The 5 GHz band continues to function without issues. The firmware version 7.1.0 operates correctly, while version 8.0.0 appears to cause connectivity problems after a period of time.\n\n## Document_28\n\nThe issue with the Pepwave Sure SOHO MK3's 2.4GHz SSID not allowing certain clients to connect after a period of time may be related to the WiFi connection between the affected clients and the router. While the 2.4GHz SSID is still visible, affected clients cannot connect to it after disconnection, although it reappears after some time. The problem does not affect all wireless clients simultaneously, suggesting it may not be a widespread issue with the MK3's WiFi functionality. Signal strength measurements of the affected clients may provide further insight into the problem.\n\n## Document_29\n\nTo resolve authentication issues with a PEPWAVE_SOHO Wi-Fi network, ensure that the Wi-Fi AP is set to WPA/WPA2 Personal and that the correct password is applied. After saving the changes, the client device should connect using the SOHO SSID and the specified password. Additionally, it is recommended to check that the device is running the latest firmware version 6.2.0 for optimal performance.\n\n## Document_30\n\nTo prevent connection drops on devices like a MacBook Pro and iPad when using a Surf Moho with a Verizon JetPack, it is important to check nearby devices and their broadcast channels. Ensuring that each access point (AP) operates on a separate channel without overlap can help reduce interference, similar to how radio stations need to avoid overlapping frequencies to maintain a clear signal and prevent packet loss.\n\n## Document_31\n\nThe Surf Moho router maintains a stable connection to the Verizon JetPack, as evidenced by a hardwired computer not losing internet connectivity. However, there are issues with WiFi connections dropping on devices like the MacBook Pro and iPad, which may not be related to the router's WAN connection.\n\n## Document_32\n\nTo prevent connection drops when using a Surf Moho with Apple Airport devices, it is recommended to create a new network with the same SSID and authentication settings as the Peplink device. This setup assumes that the necessary wiring to the Airport Express devices is in place.\n\n## Document_33\n\nTo address connection drops on devices like a MacBook Pro and iPad when using a Surf Moho with a Verizon JetPack, it is suggested to use 2.4GHz for the WAN side due to its compatibility with public WiFi, while utilizing the 5GHz radio for the LAN. This configuration may help mitigate hunting and packet loss issues. Additionally, considering the use of another WiFi access point for the internal network while allowing the Surf Moho to manage the WAN could be a beneficial solution.\n\n## Document_34\n\nThe Peplink ONE allows users to view MAC addresses of connected devices and monitor active sessions under the Status > Active Sessions section. Additionally, there are guides available for blocking BitTorrent traffic, which can help in managing unauthorized downloads within a network.\n\n## Document_35\n\nThe Peplink ONE allows users to view the MAC addresses of devices connected to the network by mousing over the particular session, but this information is only available for active sessions. This capability can assist in identifying users engaging in specific activities, such as BitTorrent downloads, although the response does not explicitly confirm the ability to block such traffic.\n\n## Document_36\n\nUsing a Peplink device, it is possible to implement content filtering to block BitTorrent users, which can help reduce network data usage and demonstrate compliance with legal usage. This setup allows for fair usage among all users in a network, and it can assist in managing network activity effectively.\n\n## Document_37\n\nA Peplink ONE device can be used to monitor network activity, including the ability to see MAC addresses of connected users. It is possible to block BitTorrent traffic, which can help prevent copyright infringement issues. However, the ability to view MAC addresses and user activity prior to blocking specific traffic depends on the configuration and capabilities of the Peplink device in use.\n\n## Document_38\n\nA Peplink router can be used to manage internet access in a mobile home park, including the ability to set up a Captive Portal for user authentication and data management. This can help in identifying users and controlling access. Content filtering features can also be utilized to block specific applications like BitTorrent. However, tracking MAC addresses and user activity may require ongoing administrative effort, especially as users change devices. Keeping the router firmware updated is recommended for optimal performance.\n\n## Document_39\n\nA Peplink device can provide visibility into the MAC addresses of devices connected to its network, including those behind a Ubiquiti Nano Station that is rebroadcasting the Wi-Fi signal. However, the ability to block BitTorrent traffic specifically may depend on the capabilities of the Peplink device and its configuration. To monitor traffic and potentially block specific users, the MAC address of the Ubiquiti Nano Station may need to be added to the Peplink controller for proper management and oversight of the network traffic.\n\n",

    "documents_text": "## Document_5\n\nTo aggregate WAN and cellular connections using a Peplink Balance 30 LTE with SpeedFusion Cloud, it is possible to bond the two links, although the success of this bonding depends on the quality of the connections. SpeedFusion is a VPN bonding technology that incurs overhead from additional headers, which can reduce the effective bandwidth. The theoretical bonded bandwidth calculation accounts for this overhead, estimating a combined throughput of approximately 32 Mbps under ideal conditions. Testing tools such as SpeedFusion graphs and speed tests can help diagnose performance issues, with packet loss being a significant factor affecting bandwidth performance.\n\n## Document_6\n\nTo bond multiple broadband connections for internet traffic, a device capable of accepting multiple connections and using them simultaneously is required. This process utilizes SpeedFusion technology, which splits traffic into pieces and distributes it across the available links. To reassemble the traffic, it must be sent through a remote SpeedFusion device, typically located at a headquarters for enterprise users or through Peplink's SpeedFusion service for home users. For prosumers seeking control, they can host their own SpeedFusion service using either another Peplink device in a datacenter or FusionHub, a virtual machine that serves as a SpeedFusion endpoint, which is a more cost-effective solution.\n\n## Document_7\n\nSpeedFusion is a point-to-point VPN technology that requires at least two devices to create a bonded VPN using multiple WAN connections. Internet traffic can be routed in various ways: it can be load balanced directly to the internet using multiple WANs without utilizing SpeedFusion, or it can be sent over the SpeedFusion tunnel to access the internet through the remote device's internet connectivity.\n\n## Document_8\n\nSpeedFusion technology allows for the combination of multiple WAN connections to enhance internet speed and reliability. It operates on a hierarchy where PepVPN serves as the foundation, followed by SpeedFusion Hot Failover and then SpeedFusion Bonding. Traffic management approaches can be applied on top of bonding, including options such as Bonding, Lowest Latency, Weighted Round Robin, and Overflow. WAN Smoothing can be enabled to duplicate packets for reduced packet loss, consuming additional bandwidth. If WAN Smoothing is set to maximum, the SpeedFusion distribution algorithm is ignored, but at lower levels, duplicate packets are distributed according to the selected traffic distribution rules. In scenarios where the Lowest Latency distribution is used, SpeedFusion continuously selects the WAN with the lowest latency for outbound packets, adjusting as network conditions change.\n\n## Document_9\n\nSpeedFusion VPN is a suitable solution for aggregating multiple internet connections to enhance stability and reduce disconnects. It includes features such as Hot Failover, which automatically switches to another available connection during a failure, ensuring no downtime. WAN Smoothing addresses packet loss by sending extra packets that can be reconstructed, while also optimizing traffic to the connection with the lowest latency. Bandwidth Bonding combines multiple connections into a single high-speed connection, though it may not be necessary for all setups. It is important to note that SpeedFusion VPN requires Peplink devices on both ends of the tunnel for operation.\n\n## Document_10\n\nPeplink SpeedFusion technology allows for the bonding of multiple internet connections to provide a combined bandwidth, enhancing throughput and redundancy. It utilizes built-in VPN technology to achieve this, differentiating it from simple load balancing. To implement SpeedFusion, both ends of the connection must utilize Peplink devices, as SpeedFusion requires compatible hardware to function effectively. The proposed setup involves using a Peplink 710 in the main office with multiple ADSL connections and a Peplink Balance 20 at home or branch offices to achieve increased download speeds through bonded connections.\n\n## Document_11\n\nTo maximize internet connections using SpeedFusion, one option is to use a Peplink Balance 310 in conjunction with a FusionHub license on AWS. Additionally, there is a service called SimplyBonding that may provide bonding solutions, although availability may be limited based on geographic location. The concept of two individuals setting up SpeedFusion between their devices raises questions about security and traffic management, suggesting that it may be possible to configure devices to block each other's traffic while still benefiting from the bonding feature.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo achieve better throughput and connection balancing across multiple satellite internet links at remote sites using Peplink Balance routers, SpeedFusion technology is required for bonding internet links. For further assistance with outbound policies, it is recommended to contact Peplink support directly.\n\n## Document_13\n\nPeplink SpeedFusion establishes concurrent VPN tunnels across multiple WAN connections, allowing for bonded bandwidth and instant failover. This technology distributes VPN traffic across these tunnels, maximizing available bandwidth. In the event of a WAN disconnection, the concurrent tunnels provide resilience by routing traffic through healthy connections, maintaining VPN sessions without downtime. Unlike IPsec VPN, which can take significant time to detect disconnections and re-establish connections, Peplink SpeedFusion ensures seamless operation. Additionally, it offers built-in dynamic routing capabilities, allowing users to route all traffic or only private network traffic through the VPN, enabling configurations such as star topology or mesh networks.\n\n## Document_14\n\nPeplink's bonding technology, particularly SpeedFusion, allows for the aggregation of multiple WAN connections, providing increased reliability and bandwidth without the need for specialized carrier connectivity. Unlike traditional IPsec and LACP bonding methods, which have limitations such as requiring identical circuits or being sensitive to latency and packet loss, SpeedFusion can utilize any internet connection from various providers, including 4G, 5G, DSL, and satellite. This dynamic bonding capability enables users to achieve higher throughput and reliability, making it a compelling solution for businesses needing consistent internet performance. The technology emerged from the need to bond multiple connections for applications requiring more bandwidth than a single connection could provide, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.\n\n## Document_15\n\nPeplink's SpeedFusion technology provides a patented architecture for bonding multiple internet connections to enhance reliability, speed, and reduce latency and packet loss. It allows users to combine various WAN sources, including cellular and Wi-Fi, to create a seamless internet experience. SpeedFusion supports features like WAN smoothing, which reduces latency and jitter by duplicating packets across multiple WAN connections, and Forward Error Correction, which adds parity bits to maintain throughput while minimizing packet loss. This flexibility enables Peplink devices to adapt to different networking needs, making them suitable for various applications, including real-time video conferencing and broadcasting. The system can scale to accommodate numerous connections, as demonstrated by a user who bonded 101 internet connections, showcasing the technology's robustness and efficiency.\n\n## Document_16\n\nPeplink's SpeedFusion technology enables bandwidth bonding by combining multiple WAN connections, such as fixed and cellular links, to enhance throughput and reliability. This technology allows for the creation of a robust internet connection by bonding different types of networks, including Starlink and cellular, which compensates for dropouts and optimizes data traffic through dynamic weighted bonding. Additionally, SpeedFusion includes WAN smoothing, which sends copies of data packets across multiple WAN links to ensure a jitter-free data stream, and hot failover, which maintains session continuity during link failures. Peplink's solutions can be configured as standalone SD-WAN devices or integrated into existing SD-WAN setups. The InControl2 platform provides management capabilities for Peplink devices, enabling configuration, monitoring, and reporting, while also supporting geographic functionalities and remote management through mobile applications.\n\n## Document_17\n\nPeplink's technology allows for the aggregation of multiple internet connections, providing seamless failover and real-time decision-making at the packet level, which is crucial for maintaining reliable connectivity during high-demand situations such as live calls or events with numerous connected devices. The use of SpeedFusion technology enables dynamic shifting of connections, ensuring that users experience minimal disruptions even when one connection encounters issues. This capability is particularly beneficial in environments where traditional connections may be unreliable, such as rural areas with power line interference. Peplink's solutions are designed to be user-friendly, allowing for quick configuration and management of multiple connections, making advanced connectivity accessible to a broader audience, including individual users and enterprises alike.\n\n## Document_18\n\nPeplink offers unique technologies for unbreakable VoIP communications, primarily through its SpeedFusion technology, which allows multiple connections to function as a single, stronger connection.

The UBR Go LTE router is compared to the Transit Duo, noting differences in LAN ports, power input, and support for remote SIM technology. The BR1 has a maximum throughput of 100 Mbps and is a single cellular router, while the Transit Duo supports dual cellular connections with a throughput of 400 Mbps. The routers do not have upgradable modems, necessitating new hardware for 5G support. SpeedFusion technology is explained as a proprietary VPN that utilizes multiple WAN connections for continuous internet connectivity, allowing for bonding and failover capabilities. Outbound policies can be configured for traffic management, and SpeedFusion Cloud simplifies the use of these features for RV users.",
      "Peplink's solutions for branch edge networking focus on seamless integration with existing networks while enhancing application performance and reducing installation times. The Balance 20X router supports up to 900 Mbps throughput with built-in LTE for failover, making it suitable for small branch or home office scenarios. The Balance 310X offers higher throughput with multiple Ethernet connections, while the HD4 MBX is designed for cellular connectivity, allowing branches to operate without wired connections. Modular routers like the SDX and EPX can accommodate various connection types, including LTE and fiber. Peplink's Wi-Fi access points, including the AP1AX (Wi-Fi 6), provide seamless roaming and integration capabilities. Additionally, Peplink offers a range of switches with PoE support and centralized management for visibility across networks. SpeedFusion technology allows for easy integration into existing networks, providing enhanced bandwidth and seamless connectivity without disrupting current operations, and supports incremental deployments and standards-based IPsec for secure connections."

    "query": "How does Peplink's SpeedFusion technology manage and optimize multiple WAN connections for both reliability and performance, and what are the key configuration and architectural considerations for deploying it in diverse environments?",
    "answer": "Peplink's SpeedFusion technology is designed to bond multiple WAN connections—including cellular, fiber, DSL, satellite, and Wi-Fi—into a single robust connection that enhances both reliability and bandwidth. At its core, SpeedFusion establishes concurrent VPN tunnels between at least two Peplink devices (or a Peplink device and FusionHub/SpeedFusion Cloud), distributing traffic at the packet level to maximize available bandwidth and provide seamless failover. This means if one WAN fails, traffic is instantly rerouted through healthy connections, ensuring uninterrupted sessions, which is crucial for real-time applications like VoIP and video conferencing.\n\nKey features include:\n- Bandwidth Bonding: Aggregates throughput from multiple links into a single high-speed connection, which is especially beneficial when individual WAN links are insufficient for application needs.\n- Hot Failover: Instantly switches sessions to another available WAN during a failure, preventing downtime.\n- WAN Smoothing: Sends duplicate packets across multiple WANs to minimize packet loss and jitter, enhancing quality for sensitive applications.\n- Forward Error Correction (FEC): Adds parity bits to reduce packet loss without excessive bandwidth overhead.\n- Outbound Policies and Sub-Tunnels: Administrators can define traffic distribution rules and create sub-tunnels with specific settings (e.g., lowest latency, weighted round robin) to optimize performance for different application types.\n- Dynamic Weighted Bonding: Adjusts traffic allocation in real-time based on link quality, allowing for optimal use of diverse WAN types (e.g., Starlink and cellular).\n\nArchitectural and configuration considerations include:\n- At least two Peplink endpoints are required for bonding (e.g., branch router and HQ router, or router and FusionHub/SpeedFusion Cloud). One endpoint should have a public IP address.\n- SpeedFusion supports various topologies (point-to-point, star, mesh) and can be integrated with existing IPsec VPNs.\n- Device selection should match bandwidth needs; higher-end models support higher aggregate throughput.\n- The InControl2 platform provides centralized management, zero-touch provisioning, reporting, and remote troubleshooting.\n- Outbound policies can be tuned to steer traffic based on application needs and link conditions.\n- Inclusion of unstable or highly variable WAN links may negatively impact overall performance, so careful configuration and ongoing monitoring (e.g., using WAN Analyzer or SpeedFusion graphs) is essential.\n- SpeedFusion supports seamless integration with SD-WAN and can be deployed incrementally without disrupting existing networks.\n\nIn summary, SpeedFusion’s flexible architecture and advanced traffic management features enable organizations to achieve unbreakable connectivity and optimized performance across a range of deployment scenarios, from remote sites and mobile environments to branch offices and data centers.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_3\n\nThe version 8 firmware upgrade for Pepwave devices introduced a new section on the AP tab, which includes 'Status' that displays information about Access Points, Wireless SSID, Wireless Clients, Nearby Devices, and Event Logs. A 'Station Probe' refers to any device searching for an Access Point to connect to, while the Access Point (AP) displays other nearby access points available for wireless devices. The feature may help identify rogue access points by comparing names and MAC addresses, although flagging a rogue AP primarily serves for reporting purposes.\n\n## Document_4\n\nIn Peplink networking, a port can be configured as either an Access port, where traffic is untagged for a specific VLAN, or as a Trunk port, where traffic is tagged. In Firmware 7.10 and earlier, a Trunk port would present the default LAN (typically the DATA VLAN) as untagged while other VLANs would be tagged. The latest Firmware (v7.1.1) allows users to choose which VLANs are tagged when setting a port to Trunk, providing more flexibility in VLAN management.\n\n## Document_5\n\nIn a Peplink Balance 20 router, when a port is set to Access type, outbound frames leaving the router on that port are tagged with the defined VLAN (e.g., VLAN=44). For inbound frames, if a frame is tagged with VLAN=44, it is accepted; if it is tagged with a different VLAN, it is dropped; and if it is untagged, it is assigned the VLAN of the Access port. When the port type is set to Trunk, the behavior changes: the Trunk port expects VLAN tags and will drop any untagged frames or frames with VLANs that do not match the trunk configuration. Access ports automatically tag incoming packets, while Trunk ports require existing tags to process packets correctly.\n\n## Document_6\n\nIn version 7.1 of the Balance One Core, a bug related to sorting the 'Status: Client list' by Download or Upload columns has been fixed. This bug previously affected the ability to accurately sort and identify the top talkers during network congestion, which is a critical step in network management.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe most recent API documentation available for Peplink devices is for firmware version 8.3.0, and there is currently no documentation released for version 8.4.0.\n\n## Document_8\n\nTo troubleshoot connectivity issues with an ATT 5G SIM card in a MAX BR1-BF3D, it is important to verify the actual data plan associated with the SIM card, as the physical characteristics of the SIM card do not determine compatibility. The MAX BR1-BF3D may not support 5G networks, which could be a reason for the inability to connect.\n\n## Document_9\n\nA signal strength of -70 to -75 dBm is generally considered acceptable for wireless performance, with issues typically arising when the signal drops to around -80 dBm or lower. Factors such as multi-path interference, other stations on the same frequency, and radio frequency interference (RFI) can also affect signal quality. The placement of the router and the potential addition of an access point (AP) mini may help improve coverage in areas with weaker signals.\n\n## Document_10\n\nAfter upgrading the AP One AC Mini and AP One Flex 300M's to firmware version 3.5.2, WDS functionality became unreliable, with the remote APs showing low connectivity and frequent disconnections. Reverting the AP One AC Mini back to firmware version 3.5.0 restored normal operation, indicating potential issues with WDS in version 3.5.2.\n\n## Document_11\n\nWi-Fi Mesh allows Peplink and Pepwave routers or access points (APs) to wirelessly expand Wi-Fi coverage using additional APs. Direct wired APs perform better than mesh APs due to shared Wi-Fi frequencies and radios, which can limit capacity. Proper placement of mesh APs is crucial; they should be positioned between the wired AP and the coverage area to ensure strong wireless links. To set up a mesh network, a Peplink router or wired AP with 802.11ac or newer is required, along with a second AP that also supports 802.11ac or newer. Firmware versions 8.1.1 for routers and 3.6.2/3.7.3/3.8.1 for APs are necessary for mesh support. The setup involves creating a Mesh Profile in the router and enabling it, as well as configuring the APs to join the mesh network. APs will automatically detect wired uplinks and allow other wireless mesh APs to connect if they share the same Mesh ID and Key.\n\n## Document_12\n\nWi-Fi Mesh allows Peplink routers and access points to wirelessly expand Wi-Fi coverage using additional Peplink APs.

While traditional setups involve hardwired connections between APs for optimal performance, meshing provides flexibility in scenarios where running cables is impractical or too costly. Peplink supports both Wi-Fi meshing and roaming, allowing users to configure multiple APs to work together either through wired connections or wirelessly. The setup process for meshing can be done via the Peplink user interface or through InControl for zero-touch configuration. Users must create a wireless mesh network and assign it to a profile to ensure proper functionality. The technology also includes considerations for performance limitations, emphasizing that wired connections are preferable when possible.\n\n## Document_27\n\nThe video discusses the differences between Wi-Fi repeaters and mesh networks, highlighting that mesh networks provide a more seamless experience with better roaming capabilities compared to traditional repeaters. Peplink products allow for easy setup of wireless meshing through their user interface or InControl cloud management, with features such as zero-touch configuration. The latest firmware versions (8.4.3 and above) enable the use of both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies in mesh configurations. Key steps in setting up a mesh network include creating a wireless mesh, assigning it to a profile, and configuring signal strength thresholds for efficient roaming. The mesh link information page in the UI provides detailed insights into signal strengths and connection types, enhancing network management and performance monitoring.\n\n## Document_28\n\nTo optimize Starlink connectivity with a Peplink device, users should download the Starlink module from the Peplink dashboard, which enhances speed and traffic management. The setup involves connecting a preconfigured access point to the Peplink device, allowing for improved Wi-Fi coverage in areas with distance issues. The Peplink B15G router can connect to Starlink via the WAN port, resulting in significant speed improvements. Additionally, Peplink's M series data plans offer multicarrier support, allowing users to switch between major US carriers like T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T based on availability, providing a reliable backup when Starlink is not operational. These plans range from low gigabyte options to larger data allowances, catering to various user needs.\n\n## Document_29\n\nIn a Peplink Balance 20 router, when a port is set as an Access port for a defined VLAN (e.g., VLAN 44), outbound frames leaving the router on that port are tagged with VLAN 44 to ensure they are not dropped by downstream switches. For inbound frames, if they are tagged with VLAN 44, they will also be accepted and processed as such. If an inbound frame is tagged with a different VLAN, it will be dropped unless the VLAN is configured to be allowed. Untagged frames will be treated as VLAN 44 if the Access port is configured for that VLAN. When the port type is set to Trunk, it allows multiple VLANs to traverse, and frames will be passed along based on the VLAN configuration; tagged frames will be allowed if they match the trunk configuration, while untagged frames will be allowed if the untagged VLAN is included in the trunk configuration. A general guideline is to use Trunk ports for devices that tag packets and Access ports for those that do not.\n\n## Document_30\n\nThere is a confirmed bug in the 7.1 firmware on the Balance One Core that affects the sorting functionality of the Download and Upload columns in the 'Status: Client list' for online clients.

The router is centrally located on the main floor, and the user is considering either repositioning the router to the second floor or purchasing an AP mini to extend coverage. The router's transmit power is set to maximum, and there are multiple networks in the area, although no channel overlap is detected. Antenna positioning may impact coverage, with the suggestion to adjust outer antennas to a 45-degree angle for potentially wider coverage. Enabling radio boost is cautioned against due to possible interference with nearby networks.\n\n## Document_37\n\nIn a home setup with a Surf Soho router, weak Wi-Fi signals were observed in an upstairs bedroom, with signal strengths ranging from -65 to -75 dBm on the 2.4 GHz band and -80 to -83 dBm on the 5 GHz band. The router was centrally located on the main floor, and the user considered either relocating the router to the second floor or purchasing an AP Mini to extend coverage. The user utilized the Linux utility 'iwlist' to analyze the network environment, discovering a competing 2.4 GHz network on channel 8 with similar signal strength. The Surf Soho was configured to segregate IoT devices into a VLAN using only the 2.4 GHz band on channels 1, 6, and 11 with a narrow channel width of 20 MHz, while the main Wi-Fi for other devices relied solely on the less crowded 5 GHz band. The user also engaged with a neighbor to address potential interference issues.\n\n## Document_38\n\nAfter upgrading the firmware of the AP One AC Mini and AP One Flex 300M's to version 3.5.2, WDS connectivity became unreliable, with the remote AP One Flex's showing as connected but at low performance levels.

      "In a Peplink Balance 20 router, when a port is set as an Access port for a defined VLAN (e.g., VLAN 44), outbound frames leaving the router on that port are tagged with VLAN 44 to ensure they are not dropped by downstream switches. For inbound frames, if they are tagged with VLAN 44, they will also be accepted and processed as such. If an inbound frame is tagged with a different VLAN, it will be dropped unless the VLAN is configured to be allowed. Untagged frames will be treated as VLAN 44 if the Access port is configured for that VLAN. When the port type is set to Trunk, it allows multiple VLANs to traverse, and frames will be passed along based on the VLAN configuration; tagged frames will be allowed if they match the trunk configuration, while untagged frames will be allowed if the untagged VLAN is included in the trunk configuration. A general guideline is to use Trunk ports for devices that tag packets and Access ports for those that do not.",

    "query": "How does Peplink's SpeedFusion technology support reliable, high-performance connectivity in both marine and enterprise environments, and what hardware and management features are essential for maximizing its effectiveness?",
    "answer": "Peplink's SpeedFusion technology enables the aggregation and intelligent management of multiple WAN connections—such as cellular, satellite, WiFi, and Ethernet—to deliver reliable, high-performance connectivity for both marine and enterprise environments. In marine scenarios, SpeedFusion bonds up to 13 WAN links, automatically prioritizing lower-cost connections and facilitating seamless transitions as vessels move between coverage areas, ensuring continuous service for critical applications like VoIP and remote monitoring. In enterprise settings, SpeedFusion provides bandwidth bonding, hot failover, and session persistence, combining multiple wired and wireless connections (including 5G) to maximize throughput and maintain connectivity during outages or when individual links degrade.\n\nThe effectiveness of SpeedFusion is enhanced by Peplink's diverse hardware options, such as the HD4 MBX 5G for demanding use cases requiring multiple modems, and the Balance series for flexible aggregation of various WAN types. High-performance, multi-band antennas (such as the Puma series) are essential, especially for 5G, to optimize signal quality and throughput. Centralized management through Peplink's InControl platform allows for zero-touch provisioning, traffic shaping, and remote monitoring, while on-device features like content caching and advanced security (Layer 7 firewall, PCI compliance) further support efficient, resilient operations. These combined capabilities make SpeedFusion a robust solution for maintaining unbreakable connectivity in both challenging maritime deployments and complex enterprise networks.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nPeplink's high availability (HA) feature operates on a master/slave architecture, where one router is designated as the master and the other as a backup. The backup router remains inactive while the master is operational, only becoming active if the master fails. This implementation does not support a peer-to-peer relationship where both routers can independently manage their own WANs and VLANs while providing backup for each other. The HA configuration requires synchronization of settings between the master and slave, which is optional but necessary for the slave to be prepared for activation in case of a master failure. If synchronization is not enabled, the slave must be manually configured to match the master.\n\n## Document_2\n\nIn a high availability (HA) setup for Peplink Balance routers in NAT mode, the LAN configuration requires a Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) setup with a virtual IP (VIP) for the master and slave units. For the WAN configuration, two options are presented. Option 1 requires three VRRP groups: one for the LAN and one for each ISP, necessitating a total of six public IP addresses. Option 2 suggests a simpler configuration with only two public IP addresses, where the master unit handles both WAN connections and the slave unit takes over the WAN IP address upon failover. The WAN setup involves two ISPs, each with its own subnet and gateway.\n\n## Document_3\n\nPepwave routers support high availability configurations using the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) as defined in RFC 3768, allowing for redundancy and failover in a master-slave arrangement. In this configuration, two Pepwave routers communicate over the LAN using VRRP, broadcasting heartbeat signals at a frequency of one per second. If the master router fails to send a heartbeat signal for 3 seconds or longer, the slave router activates, initiates WAN connections, and binds to a preconfigured LAN IP address. Upon recovery, the master router will regain its active status by default.\n\n## Document_4\n\nTo implement a 1+1 Backup using Peplink Balance devices or MAX 700/HD, both devices must operate in active-standby mode, utilizing High Availability (HA) failover based on Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). The master device sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets to a multicast address, and the slave device takes over if these packets are not received within a specified interval. Both devices must be on the same subnet and share the same HA group identifier. The configuration requires setting a virtual IP (VIP) as the default gateway for LAN hosts, and additional Ethernet switches are recommended to avoid a single point of failure. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave unit to automatically apply changes from the master unit, or the slave can be configured manually using an exported configuration file. The failover process typically takes 10-15 seconds, and both devices should be connected to the Internet in the same mode (NAT or Drop-in).\n\n## Document_5\n\nFor implementing a 1+1 Backup with Peplink Balance devices or MAX 700/HD in active-standby mode, the master device handles LAN traffic until it fails, at which point the slave device takes over. Peplink Balance 210 and above support High Availability (HA) failover using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), where periodic VRRP advertisement packets are sent from the master to a multicast address. If these packets are not received within a specified time, the slave assumes the master’s responsibilities. Both devices must be on the same subnet and share the same HA group identifier. Configuration involves setting up a virtual IP (VIP) as the default gateway for LAN hosts, and additional Ethernet switches are recommended to prevent a single point of failure. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave to automatically adopt changes from the master, or it can be configured manually. The failover typically occurs within 10-15 seconds, and both devices should connect to the Internet in the same mode, either NAT or Drop-in mode, with specific configurations for each.\n\n## Document_6\n\nPeplink Balance devices or MAX 700/HD can operate in active-standby mode for 1+1 Backup, where the master device handles LAN traffic until it goes down, at which point the slave device takes over. High Availability (HA) failover is supported on Peplink Balance 210 and above, utilizing Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) to manage failover. The master device sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets, and if these are not received within a specified interval, the slave assumes the master’s responsibilities. Configuration requires both devices to be on the same subnet and to use the same HA group identifier. The virtual IP (VIP) serves as the default gateway for devices on the LAN. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave to automatically apply changes from the master every five minutes, or the slave can be configured manually. Failover typically occurs within 10-15 seconds, and both devices must be connected to the internet in the same mode (NAT or Drop-in).\n\n## Document_7\n\nPeplink Balance devices and MAX 700/HD support High Availability (HA) failover using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), allowing a slave device to take over when the master device fails. The master device sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets, and if these are not received within a specified time, the slave assumes the master’s responsibilities. The configuration requires both devices to be on the same subnet and to use the same HA group identifier. The virtual IP address (VIP) serves as the default gateway for devices on the LAN segment. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave unit to automatically apply changes from the master unit, or it can be configured manually. Failover typically occurs within 10-15 seconds, and both devices must be connected to the internet in the same mode (NAT or Drop-in).\n\n## Document_8\n\nIn a 1+1 Backup configuration using Peplink Balance devices or MAX 700/HD, High Availability (HA) failover is achieved through the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). The master device sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets to specific multicast addresses, and if the slave device does not receive these packets within a defined time interval, it assumes the master’s responsibilities. The configuration requires both devices to be on the same subnet and utilize the same HA group identifier. In NAT mode, the virtual IP (VIP) serves as the default gateway for all LAN hosts. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave unit to automatically apply changes from the master unit, or it can be configured manually. Failover typically occurs within 10-15 seconds, and both devices must be connected to the internet in the same mode (NAT or Drop-in).\n\n## Document_9\n\nFor implementing a 1+1 Backup with Peplink Balance devices or MAX 700/HD in active-standby mode, both devices must be configured to support High Availability (HA) failover using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). The master device sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets, and if these are not received within a predefined interval, the slave device takes over. Both devices must be on the same subnet and use the same HA group identifier. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave unit to automatically apply changes from the master every 5 minutes. The failover typically occurs within 10-15 seconds, and the virtual IP (VIP) serves as the default gateway for all hosts on the LAN segment. In NAT mode, the VIP must be set as the default gateway for connected devices, while in Drop-in mode, no additional configuration is needed for hosts in the LAN segment.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo implement a 1+1 Backup with Peplink Balance devices or MAX 700/HD in active-standby mode, both devices must be configured to support High Availability (HA) failover using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP).

This failover is based on the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), where a heartbeat is sent from the master to the slave. If the heartbeat is lost, the slave assumes the master’s role. Both BR1 routers must be connected to the same LAN, and they can use separate cellular WAN connections. Configuration requires setting the same HA group number, a Virtual IP address, and individual IP addresses for each router. The master device's configuration can be synchronized to the slave device, and testing can be done by disconnecting the master to ensure the slave takes over.\n\n## Document_12\n\nHigh Availability (HA) failover is supported on the Peplink MAX BR1 starting from Firmware 7, allowing a slave unit to take over the role of a master unit in case of failure, providing hardware redundancy. HA failover utilizes the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), where a heartbeat is sent from the master to the slave device. Both BR1 routers must be connected to the same LAN for VRRP to function, and they can use separate cellular WAN connections. Configuration requires setting the same HA group number on both devices, defining a Virtual IP address that serves as the default gateway for the LAN, and assigning additional IP addresses to each router. The configuration process involves logging into the master device, enabling HA, and applying the settings, followed by configuring the slave device to synchronize settings with the master.\n\n## Document_13\n\nHigh availability mode on Peplink routers, also known as Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), allows for seamless failover between two routers configured in master and slave mode. In this setup, one router (the master) handles all connectivity, while the other (the slave) remains on standby. If the master router experiences a failure, the slave router automatically takes over within approximately 15 seconds, ensuring continuous internet connectivity. The demonstration involved two Peplink Balance 380 routers, with an active ping to Google's public DNS to monitor connectivity. When the master router was turned off, the pings stopped, but once the slave router assumed master status, the pings resumed, demonstrating the effectiveness of the high availability setup. The process also includes the ability for the master router to regain control once it is powered back on, reverting the roles of the routers accordingly.\n\n## Document_14\n\nHigh Availability (HA) mode, also known as HA mode, provides hardware redundancy by allowing a slave unit to take over the role of a master unit in the event of a failure. This failover mechanism is based on the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), which sends a heartbeat signal from the master device to the slave device. If the heartbeat is lost due to hardware failure or disconnection, the slave unit assumes the master role. The setup involves configuring two Peplink Balance 20X devices, where the master device is set up first by enabling HA mode, selecting the master role, and configuring a virtual IP address that serves as the default gateway for connected hosts. The slave device is then configured to sync its settings with the master either automatically or manually, ensuring it has a different LAN IP address. The failover process typically takes 10 to 15 seconds, during which all line connections are re-established. Successful configuration can be verified through the web admin dashboard of the slave device, which will indicate that HA mode is enabled.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe high availability feature of the Peplink Balance 20X can cause issues with cable modems, particularly those from Comcast, due to the changing of the Ethernet MAC address on the WAN port. This can lead to the modem becoming unresponsive, as it is sensitive to MAC address changes. The MAC address used during high availability is an unassigned IANA MAC address (00:00:5e:01:01:fa), which is not appropriate for this function. The expected virtual MAC address for VRRP should be 00:00:5e:00:01:fa. When high availability is enabled, the WAN port may show a private IP address instead of the public IP, and the WAN status may indicate down due to DNS test failures, suggesting that the modem is not passing traffic from the router. Packet captures during this time may yield unexpected results, such as capturing LAN traffic instead of WAN traffic.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20X high availability feature has limitations in its VRRP implementation, allowing a device to be a master or backup for only one network, which may not meet the needs for more complex configurations. Issues with the cable modem may arise when high availability is enabled, potentially due to the WAN port using a virtual MAC address, resulting in a private IP address instead of the expected public IP. The WAN status may show as down if the DNS test fails, indicating that the modem is not passing traffic from the router. Packet captures during this time may yield unexpected results, such as capturing LAN traffic instead of WAN traffic.\n\n## Document_17\n\nIn a high availability (HA) setup using Peplink Balance routers in NAT mode, VRRP is utilized for WAN as well as LAN configurations. When properly configured, VRRP allows for the transfer of WAN addresses from the master router to the slave router in the event of a failure. This means that only one public IP address is needed for the HA setup, as the slave router will take over the master router's public IP address upon failure, rather than requiring multiple public IP addresses for each router.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Peplink Max HD4 can function as a backup router in a VRRP configuration alongside two other routers, where it can serve as the third backup router. However, the default VRRP priority for the HD4 is not specified, and it appears that the configuration does not allow for setting a specific priority value. It is implied that if the HD4 adheres to standard VRRP operation, it should work without issues in this topology.\n\n## Document_19\n\nPeplink Balance devices, specifically models 210 and above, support High Availability (HA) failover using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). In an HA setup, periodic VRRP advertisement packets are sent from the master device to specific IP multicast addresses, allowing the slave device to take over if the master fails. The virtual IP (VIP) serves as the default gateway for LAN devices, and both master and slave units must be on the same subnet with a unique HA group identifier. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave to automatically apply changes from the master every five minutes, but this locks the slave's web admin interface until disabled. Failover typically occurs within 10-15 seconds, and both devices must be connected to the internet in the same mode, either NAT or Drop-in mode, with the VIP set as the default gateway for LAN hosts.\n\n## Document_20\n\nIn a 1+1 Backup configuration using Peplink Balance devices or MAX 700/HD, High Availability (HA) failover is achieved through the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). The master device sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets, and if these are not received within a specified time, the slave device takes over. Both devices must be on the same subnet and use the same HA group identifier. The virtual IP address (VIP) serves as the default gateway for all LAN hosts. Configuration for the master and slave units involves enabling HA, setting preferred roles, and configuring LAN IP addresses. In the event of a failover, the slave device's WAN connections become active and use the same IP address as the master device, with a typical recovery time of 10-15 seconds. The setup can be configured in either NAT mode or Drop-in mode, with specific requirements for each.\n\n## Document_21\n\nPeplink Balance devices, specifically the Balance 210 or above and MAX 700/HD, support High Availability (HA) failover using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP).

The configuration requires both devices to be on the same subnet and use the same HA group identifier. The virtual IP (VIP) serves as the default gateway for all LAN hosts. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave unit to automatically apply changes from the master unit.

      "Peplink's high availability (HA) feature operates on a master/slave architecture, where one router is designated as the master and the other as a backup. The backup router remains inactive while the master is operational, only becoming active if the master fails. This implementation does not support a peer-to-peer relationship where both routers can independently manage their own WANs and VLANs while providing backup for each other. The HA configuration requires synchronization of settings between the master and slave, which is optional but necessary for the slave to be prepared for activation in case of a master failure. If synchronization is not enabled, the slave must be manually configured to match the master.",
      "In a high availability (HA) setup for Peplink Balance routers in NAT mode, the LAN configuration requires a Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) setup with a virtual IP (VIP) for the master and slave units. For the WAN configuration, two options are presented. Option 1 requires three VRRP groups: one for the LAN and one for each ISP, necessitating a total of six public IP addresses. Option 2 suggests a simpler configuration with only two public IP addresses, where the master unit handles both WAN connections and the slave unit takes over the WAN IP address upon failover. The WAN setup involves two ISPs, each with its own subnet and gateway.",
      "Pepwave routers support high availability configurations using the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) as defined in RFC 3768, allowing for redundancy and failover in a master-slave arrangement. In this configuration, two Pepwave routers communicate over the LAN using VRRP, broadcasting heartbeat signals at a frequency of one per second. If the master router fails to send a heartbeat signal for 3 seconds or longer, the slave router activates, initiates WAN connections, and binds to a preconfigured LAN IP address. Upon recovery, the master router will regain its active status by default.",

      "High availability mode on Peplink routers, also known as Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), allows for seamless failover between two routers configured in master and slave mode. In this setup, one router (the master) handles all connectivity, while the other (the slave) remains on standby. If the master router experiences a failure, the slave router automatically takes over within approximately 15 seconds, ensuring continuous internet connectivity. The demonstration involved two Peplink Balance 380 routers, with an active ping to Google's public DNS to monitor connectivity. When the master router was turned off, the pings stopped, but once the slave router assumed master status, the pings resumed, demonstrating the effectiveness of the high availability setup. The process also includes the ability for the master router to regain control once it is powered back on, reverting the roles of the routers accordingly.",
      "High Availability (HA) mode, also known as HA mode, provides hardware redundancy by allowing a slave unit to take over the role of a master unit in the event of a failure. This failover mechanism is based on the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), which sends a heartbeat signal from the master device to the slave device. If the heartbeat is lost due to hardware failure or disconnection, the slave unit assumes the master role. The setup involves configuring two Peplink Balance 20X devices, where the master device is set up first by enabling HA mode, selecting the master role, and configuring a virtual IP address that serves as the default gateway for connected hosts. The slave device is then configured to sync its settings with the master either automatically or manually, ensuring it has a different LAN IP address. The failover process typically takes 10 to 15 seconds, during which all line connections are re-established. Successful configuration can be verified through the web admin dashboard of the slave device, which will indicate that HA mode is enabled.",
      "The high availability feature of the Peplink Balance 20X can cause issues with cable modems, particularly those from Comcast, due to the changing of the Ethernet MAC address on the WAN port. This can lead to the modem becoming unresponsive, as it is sensitive to MAC address changes. The MAC address used during high availability is an unassigned IANA MAC address (00:00:5e:01:01:fa), which is not appropriate for this function. The expected virtual MAC address for VRRP should be 00:00:5e:00:01:fa. When high availability is enabled, the WAN port may show a private IP address instead of the public IP, and the WAN status may indicate down due to DNS test failures, suggesting that the modem is not passing traffic from the router. Packet captures during this time may yield unexpected results, such as capturing LAN traffic instead of WAN traffic.",
      "The Peplink Balance 20X high availability feature has limitations in its VRRP implementation, allowing a device to be a master or backup for only one network, which may not meet the needs for more complex configurations. Issues with the cable modem may arise when high availability is enabled, potentially due to the WAN port using a virtual MAC address, resulting in a private IP address instead of the expected public IP. The WAN status may show as down if the DNS test fails, indicating that the modem is not passing traffic from the router. Packet captures during this time may yield unexpected results, such as capturing LAN traffic instead of WAN traffic.",
      "In a high availability (HA) setup using Peplink Balance routers in NAT mode, VRRP is utilized for WAN as well as LAN configurations. When properly configured, VRRP allows for the transfer of WAN addresses from the master router to the slave router in the event of a failure. This means that only one public IP address is needed for the HA setup, as the slave router will take over the master router's public IP address upon failure, rather than requiring multiple public IP addresses for each router.",
      "The Peplink Max HD4 can function as a backup router in a VRRP configuration alongside two other routers, where it can serve as the third backup router. However, the default VRRP priority for the HD4 is not specified, and it appears that the configuration does not allow for setting a specific priority value. It is implied that if the HD4 adheres to standard VRRP operation, it should work without issues in this topology.",

    "query": "What are the requirements and best practices for achieving reliable, high-throughput bonded internet connectivity using Peplink/Pepwave MAX devices (such as the MAX 700 or HD2) with multiple modems, and how do SpeedFusion VPN and FusionHub play a role in this setup, especially for streaming or disaster recovery scenarios?",
    "answer": "To achieve reliable, high-throughput bonded internet connectivity with Peplink/Pepwave MAX devices like the MAX 700 or HD2 using multiple modems, several requirements and best practices should be followed:\n\n1. Use SpeedFusion VPN Bonding technology to aggregate bandwidth from multiple SIM cards, USB modems, or WAN sources. This allows for the creation of a single, high-capacity connection suitable for demanding applications such as streaming or disaster recovery.\n\n2. For true bonding (as opposed to simple load balancing), you must deploy two SpeedFusion-capable devices: one at the remote/mobile site (e.g., MAX 700 or HD2) and another at a fixed endpoint. The endpoint can be a physical Peplink Balance router or a virtual appliance called FusionHub, which can be hosted in the cloud or datacenter. This setup enables packet-level breakdown and reassembly across all available WAN links.\n\n3. When using FusionHub, ensure it has sufficient WAN bandwidth to match or exceed the total bandwidth being bonded. FusionHub is essential for scenarios where a cloud-based endpoint is required, such as public streaming to platforms like Facebook Live.\n\n4. For point-to-point bonded links (e.g., between a central storage server and a disaster recovery server), two MAX 700 units can be used, even with dynamic public IP addresses, by leveraging Dynamic DNS services for addressing and maintaining the VPN tunnel.\n\n5. Avoid including high-latency connections in the bonding pool, as they can degrade the performance of the bonded link.\n\n6. Bandwidth management features on MAX devices can be used to reserve or cap bandwidth for individual clients, optimizing distribution and performance, but these limitations are applied per IP and not by application type.\n\n7. For streaming or similar applications, having a stable public-facing IP address on the SpeedFusion endpoint is often required. This is achievable with either a physical Balance router or FusionHub.\n\n8. SpeedFusion can work with dynamic IPs as long as Dynamic DNS is configured, enabling connectivity even in mobile or changing network environments.\n\nFollowing these best practices ensures the bonded connection is robust, high-performing, and suitable for critical use cases like streaming or disaster recovery.",

A comparison matrix of Peplink Balance models can provide further insights into their capabilities.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo configure a Peplink 30 for a home office setup where one WAN connection is to be bypassed for bandwidth management, you can set up a DHCP reservation for the dad's connection to assign a static IP. Then, create an Outbound Policy that directs all outbound traffic from the dad's static IP to use WAN 3 exclusively, while another Outbound Policy can be established to load balance traffic across WAN 1 and WAN 2. This allows for monitoring and limiting of bandwidth for the dad's connection without affecting the load balancing of the other connections.\n\n## Document_11\n\nTo send emails from Peplink routers after Google disabled support for less secure mail clients, one option is to use the restricted domain aspmx.l.google.com on port 25 for SMTP, specifically if emailing within your own domain.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe Peplink One is a sealed unit and does not support external antenna attachments. A triple-WAN gateway like the Peplink Balance One requires a connection to a cable modem and cannot eliminate the need for network cables, regardless of its placement in the house. Power over Ethernet (PoE) may be a consideration for simplifying power requirements when adding additional access points.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Peplink Balance 30 is suitable for handling traffic from 13 computers in a small office environment, which includes activities such as email access, web browsing, streaming internet radio, and security footage streaming from offsite DVRs. The Balance 30 has flush-mount brackets on the sides, but there is no official rack-mount kit available for this model; instead, a rack-mount shelf should be used for installation in a cabinet.\n\n## Document_14\n\nCurrently, it is not possible to retrieve the admin password for the Peplink 710 using SNMP. For larger Balance models (B380 and up) running firmware version 5.4 and above, an admin password reset can be performed via the front LCD panel, restoring the password to the factory defaults. If this option is not available, the only alternative is to reset the device to factory defaults and manually rebuild the configuration.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe 5G adapter is not supported by the Peplink Balance 20 HW 6, as indicated on the products list provided by Peplink. This explains the issue of the adapter being stuck on 'connecting' when used with this specific model.\n\n## Document_16\n\nFor upgrading from an existing unit, consulting with a local Peplink partner is recommended to assess specific requirements. The HD4 MBX is suggested as a suitable upgrade option.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe MAX HD2 and HD4 models have a different design compared to the MAX Transit and HD4 MBX, specifically regarding WiFi as WAN functionality. The WiFi WAN on the HD2/HD4 can connect to either 2.4GHz or 5GHz frequencies, despite having two dedicated WiFi AP ports. This means that while the HD2 does not have separate options for 2.4GHz and 5GHz in the same way as other MAX products, it is still capable of utilizing both frequency bands for WiFi as WAN connections.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Peplink BR1 Mini LTE does not support SIM bonding as it has only one LTE module, meaning it cannot bond two cellular connections. For devices that support SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding, users should refer to the comparison table on Peplink's website to check availability across different models.\n\n## Document_19\n\nPeplink is preparing to launch a new model that will support band 71, which is part of T-Mobile's deployment of 600 MHz spectrum aimed at improving coverage in rural areas of the US.\n\n## Document_20\n\nModels with LTE-A Category 6 support are expected to be available in 4-6 weeks.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo create more than two IPSEC VPN links from a PepWave Max700 device, an additional PepVPN license is required. This license can be purchased from a Peplink Partner or through the Peplink Store.\n\n## Document_22\n\nThe Surf SOHO is classified as a legacy product by Peplink, indicating that it is no longer in production and will not be restocked once current inventory is sold out. Peplink is in the process of developing a new product for the SOHO market, although details about the next generation of Surf SOHO are not yet available.\n\n## Document_23\n\nIt is common for Peplink routers, such as the Surf SOHO, to be shipped with firmware that is not the latest version, as devices may be manufactured during earlier firmware eras. Concerns about the router being an open-box return can arise if the antennas are not sealed properly, but this does not necessarily indicate a defect. The warranty expiration date should be verified using the serial number for assurance.\n\n## Document_24\n\nFor Peplink Balance 305, 380, and above, the admin password can be reset via the LCD panel starting from firmware 5.4, under Maintenance > Reset Admin Password, which resets the password to 'admin'. For Balance 20, 30, 210, and 310 models, starting from firmware 6.1.0, the password can be reset by pressing and holding the reset button for 5-10 seconds, indicated by a blinking LED, which also changes the port to HTTP (port 80).\n\n## Document_25\n\nPeplink has confirmed that none of their products are affected by the Dirty COW vulnerability (CVE-2016-5195), which is a race condition in the Linux kernel that allows local users to gain privileges through incorrect handling of the copy-on-write feature. As a result, no customer action is required regarding this vulnerability.\n\n## Document_26\n\nThe Peplink B-one router supports multiple VPN protocols including IPsec, PPTP, and OpenVPN, which can enhance security for users concerned about traffic encryption. It is recommended to consider the Peplink B-one 5G model for load balancing capabilities, allowing the use of a 5G SIM from any carrier to manage internet traffic effectively, especially in shared environments where bandwidth may be limited.\n\n## Document_27\n\nThe Peplink Transit Mini supports Band 71, but its WAN and LAN connections are limited to 10/100M. The Balance 20X also supports Band 71, and there are additional CAT18 models available that may offer better performance and signal capabilities.\n\n## Document_28\n\nThe user ran an nmap UDP version detection on a Peplink Surf SOHO router, specifically targeting port 53, which is used for DNS services. The scan revealed that the router is running a ZyXEL P-660HW-D1 wireless ADSL router DNS daemon, indicating that it is not using dnsmasq for DNS or DHCP services. Additionally, the scan showed that DNS recursion is enabled on the device.\n\n## Document_29\n\nThe conversation references a security advisory related to dnsmasq, indicating that Peplink may have vulnerabilities associated with this software. The user ran an nmap scan on a Peplink Surf SOHO router, which revealed that port 53 (DNS) is open and identified the service as a ZyXEL router's dnsd, with recursion enabled. This suggests potential concerns regarding DNS security and the implications of using dnsmasq in Peplink devices.\n\n## Document_30\n\nTo resolve the issue of Peplink routers being unable to send emails through Google GMail services due to the disabling of less secure mail clients, users can generate an app password in their Google account. This app password should then be used as the credentials in the Peplink email settings to enable email alerts and text messages from the routers.\n\n## Document_31\n\nThe MAX HD2 (non-MBX) supports connecting to either 2.4GHz or 5GHz WiFi as WAN, depending on the settings from the third-party access point. Users can configure the connection to prioritize 5GHz by adjusting the appropriate settings.\n\n## Document_32\n\nThe MAX HD2 (non-MBX) has a different WiFi WAN and WiFi AP radio design compared to other MAX products, which limits its ability to support dual-radio functionality simultaneously. Currently, it only offers one WiFi as WAN option despite having two dedicated WiFi AP ports, and this design choice is being reviewed by the engineering team for potential future support of dual-radio operation.\n\n## Document_33\n\nThe Pepwave BR1 Mini router does not support true SIM bonding as it has only one radio, which means it cannot aggregate bandwidth from two SIM cards simultaneously. For true data bonding, a different router, such as the Peplink Compact Dual 4G LTE Mobile Router, would be required. The user is currently using a Verizon SIM with a public static IP and is considering using an AT&T SIM with similar specifications. The setup involves two video cameras connected to the router, and NAT configurations are in place for TCP ports 80 and 81 for the Video Management System (VMS).\n\n## Document_34\n\nTo achieve true SIM bonding for throughput with Peplink and Pepwave devices, SpeedFusion technology is required. The BR1 Mini LTE does not provide SIM bonding capabilities without the use of SpeedFusion, which is necessary for combining cellular connections effectively.\n\n## Document_35\n\nThe BR1 Mini LTE does not support SIM bonding outside of SpeedFusion technology. SIM bonding requires specific handling of traffic and routing packets between multiple IP addresses, which the device is not designed to do without SpeedFusion.\n\n## Document_36\n\nPeplink is expected to support band 71, which is part of T-Mobile's deployment of the 600 MHz spectrum, likely by late Q4.\n\n## Document_37\n\nPeplink will soon support LTE-A Category 6 LTE. Additionally, Peplink routers have the capability to automatically switch cellular carriers when a new SIM card is inserted, provided the correct model is chosen based on the region (US or Europe/International) for the SIM card.\n\n## Document_38\n\nPeplink is expected to have general availability of LTE-A Category 6 capabilities and automatic cellular carrier switching by January or the first quarter of the upcoming year. Currently, they are working with partners for early customer shipments.\n\n## Document_39\n\nPeplink is expected to release LTE-A capabilities for most of its major product lines, including the BR1, Transit, HD2, and HD4 models. However, the conversation does not provide specific details about automatic cellular carrier switching or the method of manually flashing firmware for carrier changes.\n\n",

    "query": "What are the limitations of the Pepwave BR1 Mini LTE regarding SIM bonding, and what alternatives or technologies does Peplink offer for users who require multi-SIM or bonded connectivity for higher throughput?",
    "answer": "The Pepwave BR1 Mini LTE does not support true SIM bonding because it has only one LTE radio and cannot aggregate bandwidth from multiple SIM cards. It can only use one cellular connection at a time, so combining connections for higher throughput is not possible on this model. For users who require true data bonding or throughput aggregation from multiple SIMs, Peplink offers SpeedFusion technology, which is specifically designed to handle traffic bonding across multiple cellular connections. Devices that support SpeedFusion, such as the Peplink Compact Dual 4G LTE Mobile Router, are suitable alternatives for achieving multi-SIM bonded connectivity.

    "answer": "When using PPTP or L2TP VPN on a Peplink router, the DHCP server configuration significantly impacts client connectivity to LAN resources. If the Peplink's DHCP server is disabled and a third-party DHCP server assigns IP addresses, VPN clients often experience limited access: they may connect but can only reach the Peplink device itself or a subset of LAN hosts. Enabling the Peplink DHCP server for VPN clients, and assigning them addresses from a different subnet than the main LAN, resolves these routing and connectivity issues. For PPTP, Peplink's DHCP server must be enabled for reliable client-to-LAN connectivity.

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20X can load balance sessions across multiple active WAN connections by default, allowing users to achieve combined bandwidth when running speed tests from multiple devices. For testing SpeedFusion bonding, users can utilize SpeedFusion Cloud, but the maximum throughput expected is limited to 100 Mbps due to the SpeedFusion/PepVPN bandwidth limit for the Balance 20X.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 can utilize two WAN connections simultaneously and load balance between them using various algorithms. However, this does not equate to bonding in the sense of providing a single connection that combines the speeds of both WANs. For instance, if WAN1 has a speed of 80Mbps and WAN2 has 30Mbps, a single client will be limited to the speed of the faster WAN (80Mbps) unless a more complex bonding solution is implemented to allow the client to utilize the combined speed of both connections (110Mbps).\n\n## Document_3\n\nFor configuring a Peplink Balance 20 with eero Pros, users can choose between Double NAT or bridge mode, depending on their preference for utilizing eero features. The Balance 20 has a throughput of 150 Mbps, which may be less than the combined total of multiple WAN connections. For environments with 20-30 users, especially those using bandwidth-intensive applications like Zoom, it may be advisable to consider upgrading to a different Peplink model to accommodate higher throughput needs.\n\n## Document_4\n\nTo connect two hotspots (AT&T and Verizon) to a Peplink Balance 20 for maximum upload speeds, configure both WAN connections in Load Balancing & Failover mode. Set both WANs to 'Always-on (Priority 1)' in the WAN settings and ensure the Outbound Policy is set to 'Auto'. You can monitor the status of each WAN under Status -> Active Sessions. For more advanced bonding capabilities, consider upgrading to a Balance 20X and utilizing SpeedFusion technology with a FusionHub Solo or a partner hosting SpeedFusion tunnels.\n\n## Document_5\n\nTo connect multiple hotspots to a Peplink device for increased bandwidth and speed, it is important to utilize the Load Balancing & Failover capabilities of the device. For bonding connections from multiple sources, SpeedFusion Cloud can be employed, which allows for the effective use of both AT&T and Verizon hotspots connected via Ethernet to the Peplink device.\n\n## Document_6\n\nWhen setting up a PepVPN on a Peplink Balance 20, if the status shows 'starting' instead of 'established', it is important to check the status on the other Peplink router involved in the VPN connection for troubleshooting. The Peplink Balance 20 is not compatible with CyberGhost VPN, indicating that users should rely on PepVPN for their VPN needs.\n\n## Document_7\n\nTo configure a Peplink Balance 20 with two WAN ports and connect it to a Sonicwall firewall, connect the Sonicwall to the LAN port of the Balance 20. All protected LAN devices should then be placed behind the Sonicwall. The drop-in feature is not necessary for this setup.\n\n## Document_8\n\nTo configure a Peplink Balance 20 with 2 WAN ports connected to a SonicWall firewall without using drop-in mode, the SonicWall firewall must be set to L2 Bridge Mode or Transparent Mode if using SonicOS enhanced firmware. If these modes are not available, a double NAT configuration will be necessary, requiring a private IP address on the WAN interface of the SonicWall.\n\n## Document_9\n\nTo configure a Peplink Balance 20 with two WAN ports connected to a Sonicwall firewall, the Sonicwall should be set to Transparent Mode. In this setup, the firewall acts as a LAN device behind the Balance router, passing through the gateway IP of the Balance. The Sonicwall will acquire a LAN IP from the Balance via DHCP, and it is recommended to set up a DHCP reservation for the Sonicwall to ensure it always receives the same IP. In this configuration, the LAN devices will perceive the Sonicwall as transparent, communicating with the Balance as if the firewall is not present, while the Sonicwall filters requests according to its settings.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 does not support bonding of DSL connections but offers effective load balancing, which can provide a similar experience. For optimal setup, it is recommended to set the routers to 'bridge mode' to assign the public IP address directly to the Pepwave device. Additionally, configuring Outbound policies will define how the two WAN connections are utilized, with specific rules suggested for balancing between similar links.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 differs from higher tier models primarily in the number of recommended users it supports, routing throughput, and advanced features such as inbound load-balancing and SpeedFusion, which may not be relevant for basic load balancing needs. Performance increases from using a Peplink Balance device may not be observed with a VPN client, as the performance is dependent on the behavior of the traffic rather than the hardware used.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 functions as a session-based load balancer, allowing the use of two 20Mb DSL connections for overall bandwidth management and providing instant fail-over and fail-back capabilities. However, it does not support simultaneous use of both connections for a single video stream, meaning streaming speed would be capped at 20Mbps. True bandwidth bonding, which allows for the aggregation of bandwidth from multiple connections, is only available with SpeedFusion technology on Peplink Balance 210 and higher models, which requires a compatible device at both ends for site-to-site VPN functionality.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 can have a private IP on the same subnet as the WAN of a Sonicwall firewall. While double NAT is not considered an issue, it is important to ensure that the firewall is not in transparent mode, as its LAN and WAN interfaces should be on different subnets. Proper configuration of static routes is necessary for effective network operation, and the placement of these routes should be clarified.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo set up a Peplink Balance 20 with existing DSL and incoming Cable services, the DSL modem should be configured in bridge mode and connected to WAN1, while the Cable modem connects to WAN2. The Balance 20 typically uses the IP range 192.168.1.x, which may need to be adjusted depending on the existing network configuration. Additionally, traffic prioritization can be configured on the Balance 20 to prioritize certain domains for cloud-based applications while deprioritizing streaming services.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 does not support packet-level bonding for routing specific website traffic through designated WANs; this capability is available only on the Balance 210 and higher with SpeedFusion technology. In a load balancing setup, video streams can only utilize one WAN connection at a time. Additionally, video streaming is bandwidth-intensive, with an average 90-minute movie consuming 6-9GB of data at 1080P resolution.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a bandwidth limit of 100 Mbps, which may be a concern if WAN speeds increase significantly beyond current levels. It does not offer user or group bandwidth limitations, which means it cannot allocate minimum bandwidth for specific users or servers. The device can handle two WAN connections, one with two static IP addresses and another as a DHCP device, allowing for proper routing to separate LAN devices. However, the new firmware version 6.1 for Peplink 20 and 30 provides PepVPN but does not support SpeedFusion for bonding connections.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a bandwidth limit of 100 Mbps, which may be a concern if WAN speeds increase significantly in the future. The device supports PePVPN in the new 6.1 firmware, providing session persistence but lacking WAN aggregation features found in SpeedFusion. The Balance 20 does not offer user or group bandwidth limitations, which may be a drawback for users needing to allocate minimum bandwidth to specific devices. Additionally, the Balance 20 can handle two WAN connections, one with two static IP addresses and another with a dynamic IP, ensuring proper routing to separate LAN devices.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 allows for the combination of multiple WAN connections to enhance network performance, providing significant improvements in download and upload speeds. However, the ability to set individual bandwidth limits for users via IP or MAC address is not available on the Balance 20, as this feature is reserved for higher-end Enterprise class models. The user has updated to the latest firmware version 5.4.9 build 1732.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a router throughput rating of 100 Mbps, which is sufficient for the combined bandwidth of the user's Comcast and Century Link DSL connections, totaling slightly over 50 Mbps. The device can support 1-25 LAN clients, making it suitable for the anticipated growth to 21 clients (9 VoIP lines and 12 computers). The primary bottleneck in this setup is likely the Century Link DSL connection, especially considering the daily internet traffic of 2-3 GB, which is manageable given the available bandwidth. The Balance 20 should continue to perform well under the current and projected usage, with the option to upgrade later if necessary.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20X (B20X) is rated for a maximum throughput of 60Mbps when using SpeedFusion VPN with encryption. The performance may be significantly lower when using OpenVPN, which could explain the clients' inability to achieve speeds over 20Mbps on a 1Gbps fiber connection.\n\n## Document_21\n\nThe initial setup of a Peplink Balance router involves logging into the router, changing default passwords, and configuring Wi-Fi settings. Users can connect to the router via an Ethernet cable or the default Wi-Fi network, which can be identified by a label on the bottom of the device. The default IP address for accessing the router's administration settings is 192.168.1.1. After bypassing any browser security warnings, users log in with default credentials (admin/admin) and are prompted to create a new password of at least 10 characters. If the router supports Wi-Fi, users can also set a new Wi-Fi password and SSID. For enhanced security, the Wi-Fi security settings should be adjusted to WPA3 Personal, or WPA2/WPA3 Personal if there are connection issues. Changes must be saved and applied, and users may need to reconnect to the Wi-Fi after these adjustments.\n\n## Document_22\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20X router setup involves attaching antennas and connecting to various internet services, including wired connections, cellular SIM cards, or USB cellular modems. After powering the router, users should wait for the status and Wi-Fi LEDs to turn green before connecting via Wi-Fi or Ethernet. The default Wi-Fi name includes the last four characters of the serial number, and the default password is found on the router's bottom. Accessing the administration page requires entering the default IP address (192.168.1.1) and logging in with the default credentials (username and password both 'admin'). Users are prompted to change the password upon first login. The dashboard displays connection statuses, and users can configure cellular settings, including entering a custom APN if necessary. The firmware can be checked and updated through the system settings. Additionally, the router can be managed through InControl for remote support and monitoring, allowing users to add the device to their InControl account by entering the device's serial number.\n\n## Document_23\n\nFor configuring a Peplink Balance 20 with eero Pros, it is suggested to use double NAT to retain eero functionality such as parental controls, while setting the eero WAN to DHCP for IP assignment from the Balance 20. This configuration allows for enhanced security features from the Peplink device, including content blocking and VLAN support, although eero does not support VLANs. The Balance 20's throughput of 150 Mbps is generally sufficient for 20-30 users, with typical Zoom calls consuming 2-4 Mbps each, but attention should be paid to upload bandwidth. For higher throughput needs, the Balance 20X offers 900 Mbps but has only one WAN port, while the Balance One or Balance Two provide multiple WAN ports at a higher price point.\n\n## Document_24\n\nTo determine if an upgrade from the Peplink Balance 20 is necessary, users should monitor CPU usage and current bandwidth, as the Balance 20 has a throughput limit of 150Mbps. If CPU usage is frequently near maximum or if bandwidth often maxes out, an upgrade may be warranted. For optimal network management, especially with different user groups, implementing VLANs is recommended, as the mesh system in use should support VLANs. Peplink devices do not support mesh networking directly but can utilize a device connector for WiFi extension, which also supports VLANs.\n\n## Document_25\n\nIt is possible to configure a Peplink Balance 20 with private IP addresses on both the WAN and LAN interfaces. However, these private IPs must be in unique subnets to ensure proper routing by the device. This setup allows for the integration of the Peplink device between two ISP connections while maintaining a connection to an existing Sonicwall firewall.\n\n## Document_26\n\nFor the installation of a Balance 20 in an office with existing DSL and incoming Cable services, the DSL modem should be set to bridge mode and connected to WAN1, while the Cable modem connects to WAN2. The Balance 20's LAN IP should be set to a different subnet than the WAN connections to avoid conflicts; for example, LAN can be 192.168.1.x, WAN1 can be 192.168.0.x, and WAN2 can be 192.168.2.x.\n\n## Document_27\n\nFor setting up a Balance 20 in an office with existing DSL and incoming Cable services, the DSL modem should be configured in bridge mode and connected to WAN1 of the Balance 20, while the Cable modem connects to WAN2. The Balance 20 typically uses a default IP address of 192.168.1.x, and it is important to verify the default web admin IP address of the DSL modem, which is often 192.168.100.1, but may vary depending on the specific modem model.\n\n## Document_28\n\nOn a Peplink Balance 20, it is possible to bind a specific website address to a specific WAN by creating a custom outbound rule. This allows traffic to be routed through a designated WAN based on the destination domain, enabling specific traffic, such as YouTube.com, to utilize a faster connection like a 4G LTE USB adapter instead of a slower DSL connection.\n\n## Document_29\n\nTo route specific website traffic through a designated WAN on a Peplink Balance 20, the Enforced algorithm should be used instead of the Weighted Balance algorithm. This allows for traffic, such as YouTube.com, to be directed through a faster connection, like a 4G LTE USB adapter, while avoiding a slower connection like DSL.\n\n## Document_30\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 allows for load balancing across multiple WAN connections, including a USB WAN and a DSL modem. However, the response does not specifically confirm whether it is possible to bind a specific website address, such as YouTube.com, to a particular WAN connection, such as the LTE USB adapter.\n\n## Document_31\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 allows for the combination of multiple WAN connections to enhance network performance, providing significant improvements in download and upload speeds. However, the User Groups Bandwidth Control feature, which would allow for individual bandwidth limits for users based on IP or MAC address, is only available in higher models of the Balance series. Users can utilize outbound policy settings to manage traffic, but this may not provide the desired level of control for prioritizing or limiting specific users' bandwidth effectively.\n\n",

      "The Peplink Balance 20X can load balance sessions across multiple active WAN connections by default, allowing users to achieve combined bandwidth when running speed tests from multiple devices. For testing SpeedFusion bonding, users can utilize SpeedFusion Cloud, but the maximum throughput expected is limited to 100 Mbps due to the SpeedFusion/PepVPN bandwidth limit for the Balance 20X.",
      "The Peplink Balance 20 can utilize two WAN connections simultaneously and load balance between them using various algorithms. However, this does not equate to bonding in the sense of providing a single connection that combines the speeds of both WANs. For instance, if WAN1 has a speed of 80Mbps and WAN2 has 30Mbps, a single client will be limited to the speed of the faster WAN (80Mbps) unless a more complex bonding solution is implemented to allow the client to utilize the combined speed of both connections (110Mbps).",
      "For configuring a Peplink Balance 20 with eero Pros, users can choose between Double NAT or bridge mode, depending on their preference for utilizing eero features. The Balance 20 has a throughput of 150 Mbps, which may be less than the combined total of multiple WAN connections. For environments with 20-30 users, especially those using bandwidth-intensive applications like Zoom, it may be advisable to consider upgrading to a different Peplink model to accommodate higher throughput needs.",
      "To connect two hotspots (AT&T and Verizon) to a Peplink Balance 20 for maximum upload speeds, configure both WAN connections in Load Balancing & Failover mode. Set both WANs to 'Always-on (Priority 1)' in the WAN settings and ensure the Outbound Policy is set to 'Auto'. You can monitor the status of each WAN under Status -> Active Sessions. For more advanced bonding capabilities, consider upgrading to a Balance 20X and utilizing SpeedFusion technology with a FusionHub Solo or a partner hosting SpeedFusion tunnels.",
      "To connect multiple hotspots to a Peplink device for increased bandwidth and speed, it is important to utilize the Load Balancing & Failover capabilities of the device. For bonding connections from multiple sources, SpeedFusion Cloud can be employed, which allows for the effective use of both AT&T and Verizon hotspots connected via Ethernet to the Peplink device.",
      "When setting up a PepVPN on a Peplink Balance 20, if the status shows 'starting' instead of 'established', it is important to check the status on the other Peplink router involved in the VPN connection for troubleshooting. The Peplink Balance 20 is not compatible with CyberGhost VPN, indicating that users should rely on PepVPN for their VPN needs.",
      "To configure a Peplink Balance 20 with two WAN ports and connect it to a Sonicwall firewall, connect the Sonicwall to the LAN port of the Balance 20. All protected LAN devices should then be placed behind the Sonicwall. The drop-in feature is not necessary for this setup.",
      "To configure a Peplink Balance 20 with 2 WAN ports connected to a SonicWall firewall without using drop-in mode, the SonicWall firewall must be set to L2 Bridge Mode or Transparent Mode if using SonicOS enhanced firmware. If these modes are not available, a double NAT configuration will be necessary, requiring a private IP address on the WAN interface of the SonicWall.",
      "To configure a Peplink Balance 20 with two WAN ports connected to a Sonicwall firewall, the Sonicwall should be set to Transparent Mode. In this setup, the firewall acts as a LAN device behind the Balance router, passing through the gateway IP of the Balance. The Sonicwall will acquire a LAN IP from the Balance via DHCP, and it is recommended to set up a DHCP reservation for the Sonicwall to ensure it always receives the same IP. In this configuration, the LAN devices will perceive the Sonicwall as transparent, communicating with the Balance as if the firewall is not present, while the Sonicwall filters requests according to its settings.",
      "The Peplink Balance 20 does not support bonding of DSL connections but offers effective load balancing, which can provide a similar experience. For optimal setup, it is recommended to set the routers to 'bridge mode' to assign the public IP address directly to the Pepwave device. Additionally, configuring Outbound policies will define how the two WAN connections are utilized, with specific rules suggested for balancing between similar links.",
      "The Peplink Balance 20 differs from higher tier models primarily in the number of recommended users it supports, routing throughput, and advanced features such as inbound load-balancing and SpeedFusion, which may not be relevant for basic load balancing needs. Performance increases from using a Peplink Balance device may not be observed with a VPN client, as the performance is dependent on the behavior of the traffic rather than the hardware used.",
      "The Peplink Balance 20 functions as a session-based load balancer, allowing the use of two 20Mb DSL connections for overall bandwidth management and providing instant fail-over and fail-back capabilities. However, it does not support simultaneous use of both connections for a single video stream, meaning streaming speed would be capped at 20Mbps. True bandwidth bonding, which allows for the aggregation of bandwidth from multiple connections, is only available with SpeedFusion technology on Peplink Balance 210 and higher models, which requires a compatible device at both ends for site-to-site VPN functionality.",
      "The Peplink Balance 20 can have a private IP on the same subnet as the WAN of a Sonicwall firewall. While double NAT is not considered an issue, it is important to ensure that the firewall is not in transparent mode, as its LAN and WAN interfaces should be on different subnets. Proper configuration of static routes is necessary for effective network operation, and the placement of these routes should be clarified.",

    "answer": "The Peplink Balance 20 manages multiple WAN connections by performing session-based load balancing, distributing sessions across the available WANs to enhance overall bandwidth for multiple users and devices. However, it does not support true bonding—meaning a single session, such as a video stream or file download, will only use the bandwidth of one WAN at a time. Advanced bonding, where multiple WANs are combined to provide a single, faster connection for individual sessions, is only available with SpeedFusion technology, which is not supported on the Balance 20 but is available on the Balance 20X (albeit with a bandwidth cap). The Balance 20X can utilize SpeedFusion Cloud for bonding, but the maximum throughput is limited to 100 Mbps. For basic load balancing (without bonding), both models can increase aggregate bandwidth for multiple sessions, but only the Balance 20X supports SpeedFusion bonding for single-session aggregation, subject to device-specific throughput limits.",

    "query": "How does switching a backup WAN connection between Hot Standby and Cold Standby modes affect WAN health checks, standby traffic costs, and failover performance on Peplink Balance and MAX series routers, particularly in multi-WAN or SpeedFusion setups?",
    "answer": "Switching a backup WAN to Hot Standby mode keeps the connection active and enables continuous WAN health checks, which allows for proactive monitoring and faster failover. However, this may result in ongoing background traffic (such as SpeedFusion tunnel keepalives or health checks) even when the WAN is not actively used, potentially incurring costs on metered connections. In contrast, setting a backup WAN to Cold Standby disconnects the link, disabling health checks and eliminating standby traffic costs, but this also means that the connection will take longer to become active during failover and users will not be alerted to issues with the backup WAN until it is needed. In multi-WAN or SpeedFusion setups, Hot Standby can cause unexpected standby WAN usage (such as a few kbit/s of tunnel or health check traffic), while Cold Standby ensures that standby WANs are only used when primary links fail, preventing unnecessary costs and guaranteeing that only the prioritized WAN is used during normal operation.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_2\n\nSpeedFusion requires a VPN connection because standard internet connections do not support features like hot failover, WAN smoothing, or bonding in a conventional manner. Peplink's implementation of SpeedFusion utilizes a VPN, which is not primarily for security but to facilitate these advanced features. Additionally, the VPN used for SpeedFusion can be configured to operate without encryption by default to reduce CPU overhead.\n\n## Document_3\n\nFor establishing a site-to-site connection between Peplink devices, it is recommended to use PepVPN/SpeedFusion instead of IPSec VPN, as IPSec can have issues with NAT. PepVPN/SpeedFusion is designed to handle NAT traversal effectively, allowing for seamless connectivity across NAT environments.\n\n## Document_4\n\nUsing SpeedFusion or IPSEC VPN to connect two Peplink 380 devices at separate sites can provide an unbreakable connection if one of the WAN links goes down, ensuring that sessions remain established. Additionally, SpeedFusion allows for bonding multiple WAN links, enabling aggregate bandwidth between the sites.\n\n## Document_5\n\nFor site-to-site VPN configurations involving Peplink devices, using SpeedFusion VPN is recommended over traditional IPSec due to its ability to maintain VPN connections during WAN failures and to aggregate bandwidth from multiple WAN connections. SpeedFusion provides military-grade 256-bit AES encryption for data security and is noted for its ease of setup. The conversation also highlights issues with double NAT and private IP addresses in the context of VPN configurations, particularly with Cisco ASA and Peplink devices.\n\n## Document_6\n\nTo aggregate WAN and cellular connections using a Peplink Balance 30 LTE with SpeedFusion Cloud, it is possible to bond the two links, although the success of this bonding depends on the quality of the connections. SpeedFusion is a VPN bonding technology that incurs overhead from additional headers, which can reduce the effective bandwidth. The theoretical bonded bandwidth calculation accounts for this overhead, estimating a combined throughput of approximately 32 Mbps under ideal conditions. Testing tools such as SpeedFusion graphs and speed tests can help diagnose performance issues, with packet loss being a significant factor affecting bandwidth performance.\n\n## Document_7\n\nSpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding can be used to combine the bandwidth of multiple WAN links, allowing one device behind the Peplink router to utilize the combined bandwidth of both connections, minus the bonding overhead. This technology can effectively increase overall throughput, as demonstrated by a user who combined two 15/1 DSL links to achieve a 25/1.5 connection, resulting in a noticeable improvement in performance.\n\n## Document_8\n\nTo increase bandwidth and speed by joining an Ethernet WAN connection and a cellular connection on a Peplink Balance 30 Pro, one can utilize SpeedFusion technology. SpeedFusion allows for bandwidth bonding, which combines multiple internet connections for improved performance. The user should consider the differences between SpeedFusion, SpeedFusion Cloud, and FusionHub, as these options provide various capabilities for establishing tunnels and managing connections, particularly when remote equipment is involved.\n\n## Document_9\n\nIn a configuration using a Peplink Balance 310X with two WAN uplinks (VDSL and Cable), bandwidth fluctuations in bonding mode may arise due to significant differences in potential bandwidth between the uplinks, which can challenge the bonding algorithm. Testing bandwidth using the built-in tools can help identify capacity limits. Monitoring for out of order, fragmented, or retransmitted packets may reveal issues such as MTU problems. For testing purposes, simplifying the configuration and considering dynamic weighted bonding may improve performance, especially in scenarios with varying WAN speeds.\n\n## Document_10\n\nSpeedFusion operates on a packet level when using SpeedFusion bonding. It is possible to run other VPNs over a bonded SpeedFusion VPN tunnel. Additionally, SpeedFusion is capable of balancing traffic across physical WAN connections even when the traffic appears to originate from the VPN endpoints.\n\n## Document_11\n\nSpeedFusion allows for bonding multiple WAN links by sending packets down each link in a round robin fashion, with the ability to stop using a link if it experiences poor performance. The Dynamic Weighted Bonding (DWB) algorithm measures response times on each link to estimate available bandwidth and dynamically assigns weights to optimize throughput based on latency changes. This approach aims to utilize the least congested links more effectively, contrasting with the standard bonding method that fills both links equally.\n\n## Document_12\n\nSpeedFusion is a point-to-point VPN technology that requires at least two devices to create a bonded VPN using multiple WAN connections. Internet traffic can be routed in various ways: it can be load balanced directly to the internet using multiple WANs without utilizing SpeedFusion, or it can be sent over the SpeedFusion tunnel to access the internet through the remote device's internet connectivity.\n\n## Document_13\n\nSpeedFusion technology allows for the combination of multiple WAN connections to enhance internet speed and reliability. It operates on a hierarchy where PepVPN serves as the foundation, followed by SpeedFusion Hot Failover and then SpeedFusion Bonding. Traffic management approaches can be applied on top of bonding, including options such as Bonding, Lowest Latency, Weighted Round Robin, and Overflow. WAN Smoothing can be enabled to duplicate packets for reduced packet loss, consuming additional bandwidth. If WAN Smoothing is set to maximum, the SpeedFusion distribution algorithm is ignored, but at lower levels, duplicate packets are distributed according to the selected traffic distribution rules. In scenarios where the Lowest Latency distribution is used, SpeedFusion continuously selects the WAN with the lowest latency for outbound packets, adjusting as network conditions change.\n\n## Document_14\n\nFor a retail store transitioning from Cisco 1800 routers to a Peplink solution, the Peplink Balance devices can support multiple types of VPNs, including IPsec for interoperability with Cisco routers. SpeedFusion can bond multiple WAN connections, allowing for increased bandwidth, but requires a compatible Peplink device at both ends. A configuration could involve using SpeedFusion for kiosks and IPsec for public WiFi, with traffic routing rules set within the Peplink device to manage which traffic goes through which VPN. Each Peplink device supports multiple VPN connections, making it feasible for remote sites to handle both types of traffic effectively.\n\n## Document_15\n\nSpeedFusion technology allows for true WAN bonding only within a SpeedFusion VPN deployment. If not deployed in this manner, users will experience link load balancing instead of bonding. Therefore, to achieve the desired WAN speed increase by combining multiple radio connections, a SpeedFusion VPN deployment is necessary.\n\n## Document_16\n\nSpeedFusion creates a virtual tunnel that utilizes all WAN links simultaneously, providing an 'Unbreakable' VPN that does not require re-establishment upon the failure of an individual WAN connection. This results in increased throughput due to bandwidth bonding, which is not achievable with IPsec alone. The configuration includes 256-bit AES encryption and two Peplink Balance 380 routers with four 100Mbit/sec WAN links from two different ISPs, but performance may be limited due to factors not specified in the conversation.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo achieve WAN aggregation for greater throughput or reliability with Pepwave devices, SpeedFusion technology must be used, which can be implemented by connecting to a FusionHub or using SpeedFusion Cloud service. Without SpeedFusion, the device will only perform session-based load balancing, distributing traffic across available WANs according to outbound policy configuration, which may lead to interruptions if one connection fails as the remaining connections reestablish.\n\n## Document_18\n\nPeplink SpeedFusion establishes concurrent VPN tunnels across multiple WAN connections, allowing for bonded bandwidth and instant failover. This technology distributes VPN traffic across these tunnels, maximizing available bandwidth. In the event of a WAN disconnection, the concurrent tunnels provide resilience by routing traffic through healthy connections, maintaining VPN sessions without downtime. Unlike IPsec VPN, which can take significant time to detect disconnections and re-establish connections, Peplink SpeedFusion ensures seamless operation. Additionally, it offers built-in dynamic routing capabilities, allowing users to route all traffic or only private network traffic through the VPN, enabling configurations such as star topology or mesh networks.\n\n## Document_19\n\nSpeedFusion technology enables mobile devices to achieve a more reliable internet connection by combining multiple WANs to create a VPN to the FusionHub Solo, which then connects to the internet.\n\n## Document_20\n\nSpeedFusion is a VPN that allows for the combination of multiple connections for increased bandwidth, error correction, and traffic mirroring over multiple links. Data flows from the device to the Peplink router, then to the nearest SpeedFusion server and out to the work server, with returning data following the same path in reverse. The SpeedFusion tunnel may introduce overhead, potentially reducing speeds depending on the mode used; mirroring may slow down the connection while aggregation could increase speeds. For optimal performance, if using a MiFi device with the Peplink B-1 router, it should be set to IP passthrough mode and connected via USB tethering if not using the 5G model of the router.\n\n## Document_21\n\nPeplink's SpeedFusion technology provides a patented architecture for bonding multiple internet connections to enhance reliability, speed, and reduce latency and packet loss. It allows users to combine various WAN sources, including cellular and Wi-Fi, to create a seamless internet experience. SpeedFusion supports features like WAN smoothing, which reduces latency and jitter by duplicating packets across multiple WAN connections, and Forward Error Correction, which adds parity bits to maintain throughput while minimizing packet loss. This flexibility enables Peplink devices to adapt to different networking needs, making them suitable for various applications, including real-time video conferencing and broadcasting. The system can scale to accommodate numerous connections, as demonstrated by a user who bonded 101 internet connections, showcasing the technology's robustness and efficiency.\n\n## Document_22\n\nSpeedFusion is a tunnel bonded VPN technology that aggregates multiple internet connections to create a session-persistent and reliable VPN connection between two Peplink endpoints. It operates using AES 256-bit and 4096 DH encrypted tunnels, allowing for secure communication across various WAN circuits. Only the Hub site needs to have public or publicly accessible IP addresses, while peer sites can operate behind NAT or CGNAT, making it versatile for modern networking environments. SpeedFusion is easier to set up than traditional IPsec VPNs and offers greater capabilities, including the ability to bond multiple connections such as 5G and cable modems. The SDX router can support up to 200 remote peers, and configurations can be adjusted to avoid IP conflicts, ensuring seamless connectivity.\n\n## Document_23\n\nSpeedFusion technology is supported on various Pepwave routers, with the BR1 Pro and newer models being compatible, while older models may require specific firmware versions to access SpeedFusion features. SpeedFusion allows for bonding multiple WAN connections to enhance throughput, but the head-end device must be appropriately sized to avoid bottlenecks. Peplink's SFC Protect is a cloud bonding service that enables users to create bonded tunnels without needing an SDX or similar infrastructure, although it has a limit of 200 Mbps and is primarily outbound with no inbound connectivity. Relay mode allows users to connect their mobile router to a home router for seamless internet access, making it appear as if traffic is coming from the home network. This setup is particularly beneficial for applications like Zoom and Netflix, which may block VPN traffic. Users can manage application routing dynamically over SFC, ensuring critical applications receive prioritized bandwidth while allowing other traffic to use standard internet connections.\n\n## Document_24\n\nPeplink's technology allows for the aggregation of multiple internet connections, providing seamless failover and real-time decision-making at the packet level, which is crucial for maintaining reliable connectivity during high-demand situations such as live calls or events with numerous connected devices. The use of SpeedFusion technology enables dynamic shifting of connections, ensuring that users experience minimal disruptions even when one connection encounters issues. This capability is particularly beneficial in environments where traditional connections may be unreliable, such as rural areas with power line interference. Peplink's solutions are designed to be user-friendly, allowing for quick configuration and management of multiple connections, making advanced connectivity accessible to a broader audience, including individual users and enterprises alike.\n\n## Document_25\n\nPeplink's SpeedFusion is a core product that enables the establishment of multiple VPN tunnels directly to clients' infrastructure, allowing for flexible management of voice services and other resources. The deployment strategies for SpeedFusion can vary, with options for self-hosted infrastructure or SpeedFusion Cloud, each catering to different client needs. The use of public IPs from data centers facilitates seamless reconnections for clients in case of disruptions. SpeedFusion can complement existing IPsec setups by providing a more seamless failover experience. Additionally, InControl2 offers enhanced remote management capabilities, allowing administrators to access devices behind Peplink routers without the need for separate management networks, thus improving operational efficiency and reducing the need for on-site visits.\n\n## Document_26\n\nTo utilize SpeedFusion or bonding, at least two Peplink devices are required, with one needing a public IP address. SpeedFusion offers multiple connection configurations, including point-to-point, mesh, and star topologies. Key features include bandwidth bonding, WAN smoothing to reduce jitter, and hot failover for maintaining session persistence during link failures. SpeedFusion Connect, Peplink's public bonding service, has a throughput limit of 200 Mbps, while hosting a FusionHub in a private cloud allows for unrestricted throughput based on the device's capabilities. WAN smoothing duplicates traffic across multiple connections to enhance reliability for VoIP and video applications, while Forward Error Correction (FEC) minimizes overhead during one-way communications. Outbound policies can be configured to manage traffic across different tunnels, optimizing performance for various applications.\n\n## Document_27\n\nSpeedFusion requires a VPN tunnel to route traffic to a server endpoint, such as a SpeedFusion Cloud (SFC) or another SpeedFusion-enabled device, where the data is processed and combined. Each WAN connection builds a VPN tunnel to the SpeedFusion endpoint. However, if encryption is not needed, it is possible to disable the encryption in the SpeedFusion configuration, which can reduce the bandwidth overhead associated with the VPN.\n\n## Document_28\n\nSpeedFusion technology from Peplink incurs a 20% bandwidth overhead due to the addition of extra header information on data packets, which is necessary for managing those packets. This overhead is not specifically for VPN protection, and while the user inquired about the possibility of using features like hot failover, WAN smoothing, or bonding without the VPN overhead, the conversation did not provide a definitive answer on whether Peplink could implement SpeedFusion differently to reduce this overhead.\n\n## Document_29\n\nWhen connecting two Peplink 380 devices at different sites via private peer-to-peer links, only one SpeedFusion profile should be set up between the two locations. Additionally, it is possible to configure priorities for which WAN connection to be utilized within that SpeedFusion profile.\n\n## Document_30\n\nIn a scenario where two Peplink 380 devices at Site 1 and Site 2 are connected via private peer-to-peer links, the use of SpeedFusion or IPSEC VPN can provide secure and reliable connectivity between the sites. SpeedFusion can enhance the connection by offering features such as bonding and failover, while IPSEC VPN can ensure secure data transmission over the links. Additionally, outbound policies can be configured to dictate specific routing behaviors, such as directing traffic from a host at Site A to use a designated link instead of the VPN for communication with Site B.\n\n## Document_31\n\nTo establish a site-to-site VPN between a Peplink-360 and Peplink-310 with a Cisco ASA, it is important to address the double NAT issue and the private IP configuration on the ASA. The peer ID on the Branch Peplink-310 should match the WAN IP of the HQ Peplink-360. The Branch Peplink-310 can operate with a PPPoE dialer and a fixed IP, but it is crucial to determine if aggressive mode is necessary for both the Peplink and Cisco ASA configurations. Creating a SpeedFusion VPN profile between the Peplink devices allows for custom outbound rules to manage traffic across the tunnel effectively.\n\n## Document_32\n\nThe conversation discusses a network topology involving a Peplink-360 and Peplink-310 with a Cisco ASA for VPN termination. The HQ Peplink-360 is in VPN passthrough mode with a static IP, while the Branch Peplink-310 uses a PPPoE dialer with a fixed IP. The configuration faces issues due to double NAT and a private IP on the Cisco ASA, which is affecting the peer ID for the VPN connection. The user is exploring aggressive mode for IKE1 on the Peplink-310 and inquiring about the need for similar configuration changes on the Cisco ASA. The conversation suggests that the network design may need reevaluation and mentions the potential use of SpeedFusion VPN for better performance.\n\n## Document_33\n\nIn a network topology where a Cisco ASA is behind a Peplink-360 configured in VPN passthrough mode, issues arise due to double NAT and the use of a private IP address on the ASA. The peer ID on the Branch Peplink-310 is incorrectly identified as the private IP of the Cisco ASA instead of the WAN IP of the HQ Peplink-360. The Branch Peplink-310 has a PPPoE dialer with a fixed IP, which raises questions about its classification as a static IP and its compatibility with aggressive mode. The configuration attempts included using main mode for IKE1 and switching to aggressive mode, but success has not been achieved. The conversation also raises the need to consider whether the Cisco ASA should be configured in aggressive mode or main mode, and whether any adjustments are necessary on the HQ Peplink-360 in passthrough mode.\n\n## Document_34\n\nIn a network setup involving a Peplink-360 and Cisco ASA, the Peplink-360 is configured in VPN passthrough mode, which allows VPN traffic to pass through to the Cisco ASA. The Cisco ASA has a private IP address on its outside interface, leading to a double NAT situation. The Branch Peplink-310 is using a PPPoE dialer with a fixed IP address. For VPN configuration, the peer ID on the Branch Peplink-310 is incorrectly showing the private IP of the Cisco ASA instead of the WAN IP of the HQ Peplink-360. To resolve this, it is suggested to configure the Cisco ASA to use its private LAN IP as its WAN IP and set the Peplink as its WAN Gateway, avoiding the need to reconfigure remote VPN endpoints. Alternatively, obtaining a new WAN IP range for drop-in mode could be considered, but this would require significant reconfiguration.\n\n## Document_35\n\nTo combine a DSL fiber connection with a cable connection for increased bandwidth, SpeedFusion technology can be utilized, specifically with a FusionHub for optimal performance. It is important to ensure that both connections have low latency and minimal packet loss for effective bonding. The hardware required to achieve gigabit speeds will need to be robust, and users should check the SpeedFusion encrypted throughput specifications on the Peplink Balance routers to ensure they meet the necessary performance requirements.\n\n## Document_36\n\nTo combine a fiber DSL connection with a cable connection at packet level, a Peplink multi-WAN Balance router with a SpeedFusion license is necessary. This setup allows for channel bonding, effectively increasing download and upload speeds by aggregating the bandwidth from both connections. It is important to ensure that the SpeedFusion license is included with the router or accounted for in the overall cost, as it can be expensive if purchased separately. Additionally, the router should be compatible with the existing network setup to avoid issues like double NAT, which can affect device connectivity and security.\n\n## Document_37\n\nTo combine a DSL fiber connection with a cable connection for improved overall internet speeds, a combination of load balancing and SpeedFusion technology can be utilized. SpeedFusion allows for the creation of a more reliable connection by aggregating bandwidth from multiple WAN sources. However, it is important to account for overhead, which can reduce effective speeds; for example, a combined upload speed of 140 Mbps may yield around 110 Mbps after accounting for overhead, and a combined download speed of 1000 Mbps may yield around 800 Mbps. Devices requiring a stable connection can be prioritized over SpeedFusion, while other devices can be connected directly to the gigabit WAN to avoid impacting SpeedFusion throughput.\n\n## Document_38\n\nTo combine a DSL fiber connection with a cable connection for increased bandwidth, a Pepwave router capable of channel bonding is needed. The goal is to achieve a combined speed of approximately 1 Gbps download and 140 Mbps upload without creating a double NAT situation, allowing the Google WiFi system to remain the DHCP handler. The user is looking for a non-WiFi Pepwave device that can handle high throughput, as residential-grade devices typically offer lower speeds.\n\n## Document_39\n\nTo combine multiple internet connections effectively, one can use load balancing or bonding techniques. Load balancing allows for distributing traffic across multiple WAN connections, while bonding treats them as a single connection for applications. The feasibility of bonding depends on the reliability of the connections; if one connection is prone to outages, bonding may be more beneficial. Pepwave devices can facilitate these functions, but the user should consider the cost versus the reliability of their connections before investing in bonding technology.\n\n",

    "documents_text": "## Document_2\n\nTo troubleshoot frequent WAN connectivity issues with an AVM Fritz Box Router, it is suggested to examine the Health Check configuration and consider using different primary and secondary IP addresses to improve stability.\n\n## Document_3\n\nTo configure band selection on a Pepwave BR1 Mini, it is possible to use two SIM cards from the same carrier. By placing one SIM in each of the two slots, users can set preferred bands on SIM A and alternative bands on SIM B, allowing for automatic failover between bands if one connection experiences issues.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe device in question is over 8 years old and is a hardware revision 1, which supports a maximum throughput of 50Mbps. It does not support 1 Gbps traffic.\n\n## Document_5\n\nTo use two active SIM cards simultaneously in a Pepwave device, a Pepwave MAX Transit DUO is required, as it has two cellular modems that support this functionality.\n\n## Document_6\n\nTo troubleshoot connectivity issues with a Vodafone SIM in a Pepwave router, ensure that the SIM is correctly placed in the designated slot (SIM B in this case) and that the appropriate settings are applied. It is recommended to untick the SIM A and SpeedFusion connect checkboxes to focus on testing the specific SIM being used, as it may take time to test all SIMs for connectivity.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe Pepwave MAX BR1 Pro 5G is equipped with a single modem that can accommodate two SIM cards; however, only one SIM card can be active at any given time, meaning simultaneous connections from both LTE providers are not possible.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe Pepwave MAX BR1 Pro 5G does not support the use of two SIM cards simultaneously for different LTE providers. The MAX Adapter 5G is incompatible with the MAX BR1 Pro 5G, as it is designed for devices with a USB WAN port and requires firmware version 8.1.1 or higher for compatible devices. A list of compatible devices for both the MAX Adapter (LTE) and MAX Adapter (5G) is provided, indicating that the MAX BR1 Pro 5G is not included in these lists.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe Pepwave MAX BR1 Pro 5G has a single modem, which means it can only use one SIM card at a time for cellular connectivity. Although it can accept a second SIM card, it functions as a fallback option rather than allowing simultaneous use for bonding. To achieve bonding with multiple connections, users must utilize SpeedFusion technology, either through Peplink's service or by hosting a FusionHub. For those needing a dual-modem 5G solution, the BR2 Pro 5G is recommended, while the Max Transit Pro Duo is a solid alternative for users not requiring 5G.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Pepwave Max BR1 Mk2 is a single modem, dual SIM device that allows users to manually select which SIM card to use or have the router automatically choose based on performance. Users can select options such as 'Both SIMs' or force the use of 'SIM A Only' or 'SIM B Only.' In contrast, devices with multiple modems, like the Transit Duo, allow each modem to be listed as a separate WAN connection, enabling users to drag and drop connections and select SIMs for each modem individually.\n\n## Document_11\n\nIn a recent test using the Pepwave MAX HD4 MBX 5G, it was found that the GPS functionality relies on a working cellular connection, specifically using the Cellular #1 chipset. If this connection is lost during flight, the GPS data cannot be recorded or captured, which poses a significant issue for data correlation with tested locations. This problem appears to have re-emerged in firmware version 8.1.2 GA, despite having been resolved in previous models and firmware updates. A Peplink ticket has been raised to address this issue.\n\n## Document_12\n\nWhen using a Pepwave Max Transit with both SIMs enabled, a health check failure will trigger an active SIM swap, allowing the device to attempt a connection using the alternate SIM. If only one SIM is selected, the health check will not initiate a swap, as it relies on the active SIM only.\n\n## Document_13\n\nWhen using the \"Both SIMs\" setting on a Pepwave device, it attempts to connect using SIM A first, and if that fails, it will switch to SIM B. Conversely, the \"Alternate periodically\" setting allows for time-based switching between SIMs, which helps to distribute bandwidth usage evenly across both SIMs, especially when there are restrictions on a single SIM's bandwidth allowance.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe Pepwave MAX Transit Duo LTEA is experiencing an issue with the 'cellular 2' band, which remains in the 'initializing' stage and does not recognize the SIM card data. The device is running firmware version 8.1.2, and the issue persists even when reverting to the original firmware version 8.1.1.\n\n## Document_15\n\nTo increase LAN internet speed on a Pepwave MAX HD4 MBX with multiple WAN and cellular connections, using load balancing mode allows a single LAN client or multiple clients to utilize the total available bandwidth. For a single session from one LAN device to leverage all available WANs simultaneously, SpeedFusion Bonding is required. A practical way to implement SpeedFusion bonding is by using a FusionHub hosted in Vultr for a monthly fee.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe Pepwave MAX BR1 has two SIM card slots but only one cellular modem, meaning it can only use one SIM card at a time, and therefore cannot double speeds. In contrast, devices like the HD2, HD2 Mini, and Transit Duo have two cellular modems and can utilize two SIM cards simultaneously, allowing for potential speed increases by using two SIMs at once.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo address disconnections from an ISP on a Max BR1 running v7.0.1 firmware, utilizing the SmartCheck feature can be beneficial. SmartCheck performs health checks on the cellular connection only when there is no active traffic, which helps maintain stability. If the connection goes idle, it will revert to using the DNS servers defined under the WAN Connection Settings.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Pepwave MAX BR1 has a single modem, which means it cannot route specific traffic types, such as data traffic and VoIP traffic, over different SIM cards. The secondary SIM card is intended for failover and redundancy purposes only.\n\n## Document_19\n\nTo insert a SIM card into the Max BR1 LTE, it should be oriented with the gold contacts facing down and the notched side going in first. The SIM card will click into place when inserted correctly. To eject the SIM card, push it inward until it clicks out.\n\n## Document_20\n\nTo resolve the issue of a Pepwave HD2 LTE displaying 'No SIM Card Detected', ensure that the correct size SIM card is being used, specifically a full size 2FF SIM card. Additionally, verify that the SIM card is inserted correctly into the slot.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo resolve the issue of a Pepwave device not detecting a SIM card, it is important to ensure that the SIM card is the correct size. If the SIM card is a Micro SIM (3FF), an adapter may be needed to fit it into the device that requires a Mini SIM (2FF). Verifying the type of JetPack the SIM was pulled from can also assist in confirming compatibility.\n\n## Document_22\n\nThe Pepwave BR1 Max Pro 5G can only maintain an active connection with one SIM card at a time, despite having two SIM card slots. When the primary SIM (T-Mobile) runs out of data, the device will automatically failover to the secondary SIM (AT&T), which is the intended functionality. Users can check the connection details for both SIM cards in the Cellular WAN settings, but only one will be active at any given time. For simultaneous active connections from two SIMs, a different Peplink device is required.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe Pepwave Max BR1 LTE can accommodate two SIM cards, but only one is actively used at a time. Users can switch between SIM cards either automatically based on signal loss or manually by selecting SIM A or SIM B. The choice of carrier and SIM card mixture depends on whether the modem will be used in a fixed location or in a mobile setting, as different carriers may provide better connectivity in different areas.\n\n## Document_24\n\nThe Pepwave MAX-BR1 has a single cellular radio, which means it cannot specify different SIM cards for different user groups. SIM B serves as a backup for SIM A in case of failure or loss of signal.\n\n## Document_25\n\nThe BR1 Pro 5G can support multiple WAN connections, including Starlink and a SIM card, allowing for concurrent use of three active WANs without needing the MAX Transit Duo Pro. However, for seamless failover between two SIM cards in a Pepwave device, a dual modem device like the MAX Transit Duo Pro is necessary, as switching between SIM cards in a single modem device results in a connectivity loss during the transition, which takes about 1-2 minutes.\n\n## Document_26\n\nThe Pepwave Max BR1 Mini is a popular cellular router that requires proper SIM card installation and configuration for internet connectivity. Users should ensure the SIM card is correctly inserted, activated with the carrier, and compatible with the device's hardware revision. Troubleshooting steps include checking the cellular LED status, testing antennas, and confirming signal strength. Users can access the router's web interface at 192.168.50.1 to check WAN connection status, APN settings, and firmware versions. If issues persist, users can download a diagnostic report from the device's status page for support. Firmware updates for both the router and cellular module can be performed through the web interface, ensuring the device operates with the latest software.\n\n## Document_27\n\nOn the Peplink Balance 30 LTE, it is not possible to use both SIM cards simultaneously for internet access. The device is designed to use either SIM A as the primary connection or SIM B as a backup connection.\n\n## Document_28\n\nTo connect a Pepwave router to Talkmobile (Vodafone), it is necessary to set the APN to custom and use 'talkmobile.co.uk' as the APN, leaving all other fields blank. For a top-tier contract, the APN settings may also need to be customized, and if the SIM works in a phone, the settings from the phone can be referenced for configuration.\n\n## Document_29\n\nTo troubleshoot a Pepwave MAX router that is not recognizing a newly inserted EE SIM card in the second slot, it is suggested to check the SIM configuration and ensure that the router is set to recognize the new SIM. The router can be configured for redundancy, allowing one SIM to serve as a backup if the primary network fails. Additionally, users can set up automatic switching between two SIMs based on data consumption, which is useful for managing limited data contracts.\n\n## Document_30\n\nTo set up SIM2 or CELLULAR 2 as an additional WAN connection on a Pepwave device, the dashboard allows for drag-and-drop selection of WAN connections. However, the command line interface (CLI) does not support switching between SIM cards; it is limited to configuring the APN. Alternatively, the device API could be utilized to create a custom application for easier management of SIM card selection.\n\n## Document_31\n\nIf experiencing disconnections with a new ISP on a Max BR1 running v7.0.1 firmware, it may be related to health-check issues or unreliable DNS servers. Testing with a different target for health checks could help resolve the disconnection problem.\n\n## Document_32\n\nThe disconnections experienced with the new ISP, Tigo, on a Max BR1 running v7.0.1 firmware may be due to the carrier resetting the connection, likely caused by the assignment of a different IP address. The issue is not related to the router or signal strength, as it was functioning properly with the previous provider, Orange Senegal. Additionally, Dynamic DNS (DDNS) will not function correctly because the connection is receiving a private IP address instead of a public one.\n\n## Document_33\n\nWhen experiencing disconnections with a new ISP on a Max BR1 running v7.0.1 firmware, it is advisable to check with the carrier regarding the DHCP lease time, as a very short lease time could be causing the disconnections. The signal strength is not an issue, with an RSSI of -79dBm indicating a good connection.\n\n## Document_34\n\nWhen experiencing issues with a Pepwave BR1 router not detecting a SIM card, it is important to ensure that the SIM card size is compatible, as the BR1 requires a standard SIM while some Jetpack models may use a micro SIM. Checking the physical installation of the SIM card is also crucial to ensure it is properly seated in the slot.\n\n## Document_35\n\nTo resolve issues with an AT&T SIM not being recognized by the Pepwave BR1 Max Pro 5G, it is recommended to upgrade the firmware of the device, as this can help with SIM auto-negotiation of the APN. Initial setup and configuration are best accomplished with a PC connected via Ethernet for more reliable access.\n\n## Document_36\n\nThe Pepwave BR1 Max Pro 5G may not recognize certain SIM cards, such as the AT&T unlimited prepaid plan, even if the SIM is activated and functional in other devices. Users have reported that SIM cards from other data devices can sometimes work in Peplink devices, even if those devices are not certified for the specific network. It is advisable to check the certification status of devices on the respective carrier's network to ensure compatibility.\n\n## Document_37\n\nTo optimize connectivity using a Pepwave Max BR1 LTE, it is advisable to consider hardware with multiple modems, such as the Balance 20X with a CAT18 module, which can bond multiple WAN connections. This setup allows for simultaneous use of SIM cards from different carriers, enhancing performance and reliability without the need to toggle between them. For T-Mobile users, it is important to ensure that the hardware supports band 71. Additionally, using building-mounted directional antennas can further improve performance. For unlimited data plans, users are encouraged to search the forum for recent discussions.\n\n",

      "If experiencing disconnections with a new ISP on a Max BR1 running v7.0.1 firmware, it may be related to health-check issues or unreliable DNS servers. Testing with a different target for health checks could help resolve the disconnection problem.",
      "The disconnections experienced with the new ISP, Tigo, on a Max BR1 running v7.0.1 firmware may be due to the carrier resetting the connection, likely caused by the assignment of a different IP address. The issue is not related to the router or signal strength, as it was functioning properly with the previous provider, Orange Senegal. Additionally, Dynamic DNS (DDNS) will not function correctly because the connection is receiving a private IP address instead of a public one.",
      "When experiencing disconnections with a new ISP on a Max BR1 running v7.0.1 firmware, it is advisable to check with the carrier regarding the DHCP lease time, as a very short lease time could be causing the disconnections. The signal strength is not an issue, with an RSSI of -79dBm indicating a good connection.",
      "When experiencing issues with a Pepwave BR1 router not detecting a SIM card, it is important to ensure that the SIM card size is compatible, as the BR1 requires a standard SIM while some Jetpack models may use a micro SIM. Checking the physical installation of the SIM card is also crucial to ensure it is properly seated in the slot.",
      "To resolve issues with an AT&T SIM not being recognized by the Pepwave BR1 Max Pro 5G, it is recommended to upgrade the firmware of the device, as this can help with SIM auto-negotiation of the APN. Initial setup and configuration are best accomplished with a PC connected via Ethernet for more reliable access.",
      "The Pepwave BR1 Max Pro 5G may not recognize certain SIM cards, such as the AT&T unlimited prepaid plan, even if the SIM is activated and functional in other devices. Users have reported that SIM cards from other data devices can sometimes work in Peplink devices, even if those devices are not certified for the specific network. It is advisable to check the certification status of devices on the respective carrier's network to ensure compatibility.",
      "To optimize connectivity using a Pepwave Max BR1 LTE, it is advisable to consider hardware with multiple modems, such as the Balance 20X with a CAT18 module, which can bond multiple WAN connections. This setup allows for simultaneous use of SIM cards from different carriers, enhancing performance and reliability without the need to toggle between them. For T-Mobile users, it is important to ensure that the hardware supports band 71. Additionally, using building-mounted directional antennas can further improve performance. For unlimited data plans, users are encouraged to search the forum for recent discussions."

    "query": "What are the limitations and options for using multiple SIM cards simultaneously in Pepwave MAX BR1 series devices, and how do these differ from dual-modem devices like the MAX Transit Duo?",
    "answer": "Pepwave MAX BR1 series devices, including the BR1 Pro 5G, BR1 Mk2, and Max BR1 LTE, have two SIM card slots but only one cellular modem. This means only one SIM card can be active at any time, and the secondary SIM serves as a backup for failover, not for simultaneous use or bonding. The device can automatically switch to the backup SIM if the primary SIM fails or runs out of data, but this switch takes 1-2 minutes and results in a brief loss of connectivity. Routing different types of traffic over different SIMs simultaneously or bonding connections from both SIMs is not possible on these single-modem devices. In contrast, dual-modem devices like the MAX Transit Duo or HD2 allow for true simultaneous use of two SIM cards, enabling higher speeds through load balancing or bonding, and each modem can be assigned a SIM independently. For users requiring simultaneous multi-carrier connectivity or bonding, a dual-modem device is necessary.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_4\n\nFor improving cellular service inside an Airstream using a Peplink Max BR1 Pro 5G with a Mobility 42G, it is suggested to avoid using an amplifier like WeBoost due to potential interference issues. Instead, consider using a Peplink device that supports dual SIMs or a two-modem setup to manage different carriers. This allows for better connectivity without the complications of signal amplification, while also enabling guests to use Wi-Fi calling and texting through a guest network.\n\n## Document_5\n\nTo maintain optimal connectivity with the Peplink Max BR2 Pro using two Mobility 42G antennas, it is recommended to connect Modem 1 to Antenna 1 and Modem 2 to Antenna 2. For proper 5G operation, all four antennas are required unless switching to a 2x antenna mode. If some antenna connections receive good signals while others do not, the overall performance of the modem may be negatively impacted, as the modem expects all antennas to receive similar signal levels.\n\n## Document_6\n\nFor a sailing boat installation of multi modem LTE, the Peplink Max HD2 Dome mounted at the top of a 45m carbon mast and the Peplink MBX Mini with two Mobility 40G antennas on the first spreader (10m high) are being compared. The MBX Mini's 4x4 MIMO antennas with higher effective gain are expected to provide better performance in terms of bandwidth and range compared to the HD2 Dome, particularly within 2.5NM/5km from cell towers, while still achieving a minimum of 500kbit/s for applications like WhatsApp calls and basic surfing/email. Load balancing capabilities may require specific service plans from Peplink, which could incur additional costs.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe default LAN configuration on a Peplink Balance cannot be assigned a VLAN tag because untagged LANs do not belong to any VLAN; data packets require a VLAN tag to be part of a VLAN. Additionally, when specifying a subnet, it is standard to use the network address format (e.g., 192.168.254.0/24) rather than an individual host address (e.g., 192.168.254.1/24).\n\n## Document_8\n\nTo configure VLANs on a switch connected to a Peplink device, it is advisable to allow both untagged and tagged VLANs between the Peplink and the switch. This is because switches utilize untagged traffic for various communication protocols that do not support tagging. Limiting traffic should be managed through the switch configuration rather than solely relying on the Peplink settings.\n\n## Document_9\n\nTo reserve static IP addresses for devices connected to a Peplink router and prevent conflicts, it is important to ensure that the DHCP server is configured correctly. While assigning a static IP to a MAC address can work, it does not prevent other devices from being manually set to the same IP address. The conversation suggests a need for a method to deny users from assigning static IPs that are already reserved. Additionally, the setup involves a VLAN configuration, with the main LAN being untagged on Port 1 and the VLAN on Port 2 of the Peplink Balance router.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe BR1 Pro 5G uses a single 5G modem that utilizes all four antenna ports (A, B, C, and D) for MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) technology, which allows for multiple carrier aggregation by sending and receiving data on multiple frequencies simultaneously. While it is possible to connect only two antennas, doing so may significantly reduce available bandwidth in certain situations.\n\n## Document_11\n\nFor connecting antennas to a Pepwave router, it is recommended to use either Cellular 1 (1A-1D) or Cellular 2 (2A-2D) for the four antenna connections, rather than splitting them across both cellular inputs. The successful connection configuration involves connecting antenna 1 to port A, antenna 2 to port C, antenna 3 to port B, and antenna 4 to port D on the router.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe Peplink Max BR1 5G router utilizes a single 5G modem chip, which means that only one cellular antenna port can connect to 5G at a time. The modem supports 4x4 MIMO technology, but for 5G connectivity, at least 2x2 MIMO is required. MIMO technology is designed to be aimed in one direction, as the serving cell expects a single client signal from a specific location. Therefore, to achieve multiple directional connections, multiple modems would be necessary.\n\n## Document_13\n\nFor optimal performance with a 5G modem, it is necessary to connect all four antennas in a MIMO configuration, as different bands used by the 5G modem require specific antenna combinations. Directional antennas should all be pointed in the same direction to maximize signal reception.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo optimize antenna configuration for the Pepwave MAX BR2 Pro, it is recommended to use two 4x4 MIMO antennas with some separation for best performance. If firmware version 8.3 is installed, enabling the 'two antenna mode' will provide guidance on which ports to connect the antennas. The number of SIM cards is not critical for performance, as having one SIM in SIM-A of each modem suffices unless carrier failover or data cap considerations are necessary.\n\n## Document_15\n\nFor optimal performance with the Pepwave Max BR1 5G, it is recommended to use identical antennas on each of the four ports, as mixing different antennas is not advisable. Given the user's proximity to the tower, a panel-style MIMO directional antenna may be more suitable than a Yagi antenna. The user reported a signal degradation after switching to 5G, with an average SINR of around 8 dB, while previously achieving better signal metrics with 4G. The user is connecting primarily to band 5 (850 MHz) and band 77 (3700 MHz) for 5G.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo optimize antenna performance for the Pepwave MAX BR1 5G, it is important that antennas connected to the ports match the frequency bands used by the local tower, specifically for 5G bands such as 850MHz and 3700MHz. Antennas can be oriented at various angles, including horizontal and vertical, or at slant angles of 45 degrees, but significant separation between elements is not necessary. The effectiveness of 4G versus 5G signals can vary based on the specific tower and carrier, and at close distances, using antennas with too much gain may not be beneficial; simpler antennas may suffice.\n\n## Document_17\n\nFor the Pepwave MAX BR1 Cat-20, the main antenna ports are A and D. Currently, there is no option in the firmware to configure a 4x4 device to use only 2 antennas through the GUI, but this feature is expected in firmware version 8.3. In the meantime, users can contact support to manually set the device to 2 antenna mode. For optimal performance, it is recommended to use 4 antennas to significantly improve download performance.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe HD2-DOME is a router with an integrated LTE modem and antennas, not just an antenna. It provides an IP address via DHCP for the SIM Injector and other devices on the same LAN. The SIM Injector's PoE output can be enabled or disabled through its web management page, but the output voltage cannot be controlled. For installation details, the technical manual is available on the Peplink website, which includes various SIM Injector installation topology scenarios and optional settings for enabling roaming for SIM cards.\n\n## Document_19\n\nA proposed design for a mounting sleeve for the HD Dome includes an M35 Female thread on one end to cover the M35 thread of the Dome and a 1\"x 14 standard Female thread on the other end to fit onto a 1\"x 14 standard male maritime fitting. The material suggested for the mount is 316 stainless steel, and there is a consideration for a cable exit opening versus having cables go through the base. A design for a two-piece stainless mount has been created to prevent cable twisting during installation, although the manufacturing cost is noted to be high.\n\n## Document_20\n\nUsing two 4x4 MIMO antennas for the Pepwave BR2 is feasible, and there are options for 8x8 MIMO omni-directional antennas available from manufacturers like Parsec and Poynting. However, it is important to consider signal loss over distance when setting up the antennas. Waveform's recommendation to use a single 4x4 antenna for both modems may not be optimal for maximizing signal strength and performance.\n\n## Document_21\n\nFor improving cellular reception in challenging environments with a MAX BR1 Mini 5G, a four-element antenna such as the Peplink Mobility 40g or a Parsec Husky is recommended, as the Mobility 82g is not suitable due to its size and excessive cellular elements for this installation. If considering a larger model like the BR2 Pro 5G, the Mobility 82g would be appropriate. Additionally, it is important to keep antenna cables as short as possible to minimize signal loss.\n\n## Document_22\n\nTo bond a T-Mobile 5G connection with WiFi from an RV park using a Peplink Max BR1 5G Pro, SpeedFusion or a self-hosted Fusion Hub is required. The SpeedFusion technology has a speed cap of 200 Mbps and typically achieves less than 100 Mbps. The Max BR1 5G Pro supports WiFi-As-WAN, allowing it to pick up and rebroadcast public WiFi signals, which can be used alongside a cellular connection for local internet access.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe Peplink Max BR1 5G Pro supports WiFi-As-WAN, allowing users to connect to public WiFi signals from hotspots, campgrounds, and other sources, which can then be rebroadcasted as a local WiFi network. To bond a T-Mobile 5G connection with a Starlink connection, it is possible to use the WAN input channel of the BR1 to combine these services. However, it is unclear whether this bonding requires SpeedFusion software or if it can be done without additional hardware or software.\n\n## Document_24\n\nManaging DNS should ideally be retained by the organization rather than outsourced to a web hosting company, as it can lead to complications, especially when transitioning to a new provider. The claim that allowing the host to manage DNS will improve performance and security is questionable; performance enhancements are typically associated with dedicated services like Cloudflare, and security features can be independently implemented. Organizations should maintain control over their DNS records to avoid potential issues, such as being locked into a service or losing access to their domain. It is advisable to verify the domain registration details and ensure that the domain is owned by the organization to prevent complications in the future. Understanding DNS record types and their functions is crucial for effective management.\n\n## Document_25\n\nThe video discusses the process of bulk updating firmware for multiple Pepwave routers using the actions menu in the dashboard. Users can select multiple devices and apply a firmware policy to them simultaneously, allowing for efficient management of firmware updates. The process involves navigating to the dashboard, selecting the devices, and using the actions menu to push the desired firmware version, such as the HD1 Dome Pro 8.5 firmware, to all selected devices at once. This method eliminates the need for manual updates for each individual device, streamlining the firmware management process.\n\n## Document_26\n\nThe Peplink Max HD2 Dome does not support 5G, making the Peplink MBX Mini a better choice for 4/5G connectivity. The performance of cellular connections depends significantly on the location, capacity, and configuration of cell towers. A multi-modem router increases the likelihood of maintaining service by allowing the use of multiple carriers. For optimal performance, antenna cable lengths should be kept short (ideally under 5m/15ft) to minimize signal loss. Load balancing is available out of the box without additional service plans, but for bonding or hitless failover, SpeedFusion is required, which incurs costs depending on the chosen service plan. Using SpeedFusion Cloud or hosting a FusionHub can provide additional features, including inbound routing for remote access to devices on the boat.\n\n## Document_27\n\nFor a sailing boat installation of multi modem LTE, it is suggested to consider Maritime antennas over Mobility antennas for improved performance, especially in varying sea conditions. While the Peplink MBX Mini with 2x Mobility 40G offers 4x4 MIMO and higher effective gain, the use of specialized Maritime antennas could provide significant advantages in terms of connectivity and reliability. The impact of antenna choice on expected bandwidth near shore and range should be evaluated, particularly for maintaining a minimum of 500 kbit/s for applications like WhatsApp calls and basic surfing/email. Additionally, load balancing with Peplink may involve specific service plans, which should be clarified for associated costs.\n\n## Document_28\n\nFor a high-performing cellular setup on a sailing boat, the Peplink MBX Mini is considered superior to the HD2 Dome in terms of performance and future-proofing. The MBX Mini requires 8 antenna elements, which may pose an aesthetic compromise. It can also accommodate multiple Ethernet WAN connections, allowing for configuration flexibility. When considering antenna placement, it's important to engage with a local partner experienced in marine setups due to the unique challenges posed by the maritime environment. Load balancing capabilities may require specific service plans, but costs were not detailed in the conversation.\n\n## Document_29\n\nIn a network configuration where Port1 is set to access the default Untagged VLAN10 and Port2 is configured as a trunk for Tagged VLAN2, there may be an issue accessing the default VLAN10 when Port2 is set to trunk mode. This configuration works correctly when both ports are set to access mode, allowing devices connected to Port1 to access VLAN10. If a device connected to Port1 cannot access VLAN10 when Port2 is set to trunk, it may indicate a potential bug in the system, warranting a support ticket to be logged for further investigation.\n\n## Document_30\n\nTo reserve IP addresses for devices with static IPs outside of the DHCP range on a Peplink device, navigate to the Network tab and select the appropriate LAN for DHCP reservation. Fill in the necessary fields to complete the reservation. Alternatively, you can reserve the current IP address for a device by going to the Status tab, selecting 'Client List', and clicking the 'label' button next to the device.\n\n## Document_31\n\nThe MAX BR2 Pro requires a total of 8 antennas for optimal performance, with 4 antennas designated for each of its 2 cellular SIM slots. A user has connected 4 roof antennas to SIM slots 1A and 2A, while using paddle antennas for the remaining ports. It is suggested that the roof antennas could potentially be connected to all ports of Cell 1, while paddle antennas could be used for Cell 2, but the optimal configuration may depend on the specific firmware version and antenna requirements for 5G connectivity.\n\n## Document_32\n\nFor improving cellular performance in an RV setup, transitioning from a Verizon 8800 Jetpack to a MAX BR1 Cat-20 is advisable. The BR1 Pro CAT 20 and the BR1 Pro 5G are both excellent devices, with the latter offering future-proofing for 5G capabilities. When using antennas, the Peplink Mobility 20G or Mobility 42G antennas are recommended for their high gain, particularly in upper frequency ranges. The IoT 20G directional antenna provides higher gain across both lower and upper frequencies but requires two units for optimal performance with the BR1 Pro.

      "For improving cellular service inside an Airstream using a Peplink Max BR1 Pro 5G with a Mobility 42G, it is suggested to avoid using an amplifier like WeBoost due to potential interference issues. Instead, consider using a Peplink device that supports dual SIMs or a two-modem setup to manage different carriers. This allows for better connectivity without the complications of signal amplification, while also enabling guests to use Wi-Fi calling and texting through a guest network.",
      "To maintain optimal connectivity with the Peplink Max BR2 Pro using two Mobility 42G antennas, it is recommended to connect Modem 1 to Antenna 1 and Modem 2 to Antenna 2. For proper 5G operation, all four antennas are required unless switching to a 2x antenna mode. If some antenna connections receive good signals while others do not, the overall performance of the modem may be negatively impacted, as the modem expects all antennas to receive similar signal levels.",
      "For a sailing boat installation of multi modem LTE, the Peplink Max HD2 Dome mounted at the top of a 45m carbon mast and the Peplink MBX Mini with two Mobility 40G antennas on the first spreader (10m high) are being compared. The MBX Mini's 4x4 MIMO antennas with higher effective gain are expected to provide better performance in terms of bandwidth and range compared to the HD2 Dome, particularly within 2.5NM/5km from cell towers, while still achieving a minimum of 500kbit/s for applications like WhatsApp calls and basic surfing/email. Load balancing capabilities may require specific service plans from Peplink, which could incur additional costs.",
      "The default LAN configuration on a Peplink Balance cannot be assigned a VLAN tag because untagged LANs do not belong to any VLAN; data packets require a VLAN tag to be part of a VLAN. Additionally, when specifying a subnet, it is standard to use the network address format (e.g., 192.168.254.0/24) rather than an individual host address (e.g., 192.168.254.1/24).",
      "To configure VLANs on a switch connected to a Peplink device, it is advisable to allow both untagged and tagged VLANs between the Peplink and the switch. This is because switches utilize untagged traffic for various communication protocols that do not support tagging. Limiting traffic should be managed through the switch configuration rather than solely relying on the Peplink settings.",
      "To reserve static IP addresses for devices connected to a Peplink router and prevent conflicts, it is important to ensure that the DHCP server is configured correctly. While assigning a static IP to a MAC address can work, it does not prevent other devices from being manually set to the same IP address. The conversation suggests a need for a method to deny users from assigning static IPs that are already reserved. Additionally, the setup involves a VLAN configuration, with the main LAN being untagged on Port 1 and the VLAN on Port 2 of the Peplink Balance router.",
      "The BR1 Pro 5G uses a single 5G modem that utilizes all four antenna ports (A, B, C, and D) for MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) technology, which allows for multiple carrier aggregation by sending and receiving data on multiple frequencies simultaneously. While it is possible to connect only two antennas, doing so may significantly reduce available bandwidth in certain situations.",
      "For connecting antennas to a Pepwave router, it is recommended to use either Cellular 1 (1A-1D) or Cellular 2 (2A-2D) for the four antenna connections, rather than splitting them across both cellular inputs. The successful connection configuration involves connecting antenna 1 to port A, antenna 2 to port C, antenna 3 to port B, and antenna 4 to port D on the router.",
      "The Peplink Max BR1 5G router utilizes a single 5G modem chip, which means that only one cellular antenna port can connect to 5G at a time. The modem supports 4x4 MIMO technology, but for 5G connectivity, at least 2x2 MIMO is required. MIMO technology is designed to be aimed in one direction, as the serving cell expects a single client signal from a specific location. Therefore, to achieve multiple directional connections, multiple modems would be necessary.",
      "For optimal performance with a 5G modem, it is necessary to connect all four antennas in a MIMO configuration, as different bands used by the 5G modem require specific antenna combinations. Directional antennas should all be pointed in the same direction to maximize signal reception.",
      "To optimize antenna configuration for the Pepwave MAX BR2 Pro, it is recommended to use two 4x4 MIMO antennas with some separation for best performance. If firmware version 8.3 is installed, enabling the 'two antenna mode' will provide guidance on which ports to connect the antennas. The number of SIM cards is not critical for performance, as having one SIM in SIM-A of each modem suffices unless carrier failover or data cap considerations are necessary.",
      "For optimal performance with the Pepwave Max BR1 5G, it is recommended to use identical antennas on each of the four ports, as mixing different antennas is not advisable. Given the user's proximity to the tower, a panel-style MIMO directional antenna may be more suitable than a Yagi antenna. The user reported a signal degradation after switching to 5G, with an average SINR of around 8 dB, while previously achieving better signal metrics with 4G. The user is connecting primarily to band 5 (850 MHz) and band 77 (3700 MHz) for 5G.",
      "To optimize antenna performance for the Pepwave MAX BR1 5G, it is important that antennas connected to the ports match the frequency bands used by the local tower, specifically for 5G bands such as 850MHz and 3700MHz. Antennas can be oriented at various angles, including horizontal and vertical, or at slant angles of 45 degrees, but significant separation between elements is not necessary. The effectiveness of 4G versus 5G signals can vary based on the specific tower and carrier, and at close distances, using antennas with too much gain may not be beneficial; simpler antennas may suffice.",
      "For the Pepwave MAX BR1 Cat-20, the main antenna ports are A and D. Currently, there is no option in the firmware to configure a 4x4 device to use only 2 antennas through the GUI, but this feature is expected in firmware version 8.3. In the meantime, users can contact support to manually set the device to 2 antenna mode. For optimal performance, it is recommended to use 4 antennas to significantly improve download performance.",
      "The HD2-DOME is a router with an integrated LTE modem and antennas, not just an antenna. It provides an IP address via DHCP for the SIM Injector and other devices on the same LAN. The SIM Injector's PoE output can be enabled or disabled through its web management page, but the output voltage cannot be controlled. For installation details, the technical manual is available on the Peplink website, which includes various SIM Injector installation topology scenarios and optional settings for enabling roaming for SIM cards.",
      "A proposed design for a mounting sleeve for the HD Dome includes an M35 Female thread on one end to cover the M35 thread of the Dome and a 1\"x 14 standard Female thread on the other end to fit onto a 1\"x 14 standard male maritime fitting. The material suggested for the mount is 316 stainless steel, and there is a consideration for a cable exit opening versus having cables go through the base. A design for a two-piece stainless mount has been created to prevent cable twisting during installation, although the manufacturing cost is noted to be high.",
      "Using two 4x4 MIMO antennas for the Pepwave BR2 is feasible, and there are options for 8x8 MIMO omni-directional antennas available from manufacturers like Parsec and Poynting. However, it is important to consider signal loss over distance when setting up the antennas. Waveform's recommendation to use a single 4x4 antenna for both modems may not be optimal for maximizing signal strength and performance.",
      "For improving cellular reception in challenging environments with a MAX BR1 Mini 5G, a four-element antenna such as the Peplink Mobility 40g or a Parsec Husky is recommended, as the Mobility 82g is not suitable due to its size and excessive cellular elements for this installation. If considering a larger model like the BR2 Pro 5G, the Mobility 82g would be appropriate. Additionally, it is important to keep antenna cables as short as possible to minimize signal loss.",
      "To bond a T-Mobile 5G connection with WiFi from an RV park using a Peplink Max BR1 5G Pro, SpeedFusion or a self-hosted Fusion Hub is required. The SpeedFusion technology has a speed cap of 200 Mbps and typically achieves less than 100 Mbps. The Max BR1 5G Pro supports WiFi-As-WAN, allowing it to pick up and rebroadcast public WiFi signals, which can be used alongside a cellular connection for local internet access.",
      "The Peplink Max BR1 5G Pro supports WiFi-As-WAN, allowing users to connect to public WiFi signals from hotspots, campgrounds, and other sources, which can then be rebroadcasted as a local WiFi network. To bond a T-Mobile 5G connection with a Starlink connection, it is possible to use the WAN input channel of the BR1 to combine these services. However, it is unclear whether this bonding requires SpeedFusion software or if it can be done without additional hardware or software.",
      "Managing DNS should ideally be retained by the organization rather than outsourced to a web hosting company, as it can lead to complications, especially when transitioning to a new provider. The claim that allowing the host to manage DNS will improve performance and security is questionable; performance enhancements are typically associated with dedicated services like Cloudflare, and security features can be independently implemented. Organizations should maintain control over their DNS records to avoid potential issues, such as being locked into a service or losing access to their domain. It is advisable to verify the domain registration details and ensure that the domain is owned by the organization to prevent complications in the future. Understanding DNS record types and their functions is crucial for effective management.",
      "The video discusses the process of bulk updating firmware for multiple Pepwave routers using the actions menu in the dashboard. Users can select multiple devices and apply a firmware policy to them simultaneously, allowing for efficient management of firmware updates. The process involves navigating to the dashboard, selecting the devices, and using the actions menu to push the desired firmware version, such as the HD1 Dome Pro 8.5 firmware, to all selected devices at once. This method eliminates the need for manual updates for each individual device, streamlining the firmware management process.",
      "The Peplink Max HD2 Dome does not support 5G, making the Peplink MBX Mini a better choice for 4/5G connectivity. The performance of cellular connections depends significantly on the location, capacity, and configuration of cell towers. A multi-modem router increases the likelihood of maintaining service by allowing the use of multiple carriers. For optimal performance, antenna cable lengths should be kept short (ideally under 5m/15ft) to minimize signal loss. Load balancing is available out of the box without additional service plans, but for bonding or hitless failover, SpeedFusion is required, which incurs costs depending on the chosen service plan. Using SpeedFusion Cloud or hosting a FusionHub can provide additional features, including inbound routing for remote access to devices on the boat.",
      "For a sailing boat installation of multi modem LTE, it is suggested to consider Maritime antennas over Mobility antennas for improved performance, especially in varying sea conditions. While the Peplink MBX Mini with 2x Mobility 40G offers 4x4 MIMO and higher effective gain, the use of specialized Maritime antennas could provide significant advantages in terms of connectivity and reliability. The impact of antenna choice on expected bandwidth near shore and range should be evaluated, particularly for maintaining a minimum of 500 kbit/s for applications like WhatsApp calls and basic surfing/email. Additionally, load balancing with Peplink may involve specific service plans, which should be clarified for associated costs.",
      "For a high-performing cellular setup on a sailing boat, the Peplink MBX Mini is considered superior to the HD2 Dome in terms of performance and future-proofing. The MBX Mini requires 8 antenna elements, which may pose an aesthetic compromise. It can also accommodate multiple Ethernet WAN connections, allowing for configuration flexibility. When considering antenna placement, it's important to engage with a local partner experienced in marine setups due to the unique challenges posed by the maritime environment. Load balancing capabilities may require specific service plans, but costs were not detailed in the conversation.",
      "In a network configuration where Port1 is set to access the default Untagged VLAN10 and Port2 is configured as a trunk for Tagged VLAN2, there may be an issue accessing the default VLAN10 when Port2 is set to trunk mode. This configuration works correctly when both ports are set to access mode, allowing devices connected to Port1 to access VLAN10. If a device connected to Port1 cannot access VLAN10 when Port2 is set to trunk, it may indicate a potential bug in the system, warranting a support ticket to be logged for further investigation.",
      "To reserve IP addresses for devices with static IPs outside of the DHCP range on a Peplink device, navigate to the Network tab and select the appropriate LAN for DHCP reservation. Fill in the necessary fields to complete the reservation. Alternatively, you can reserve the current IP address for a device by going to the Status tab, selecting 'Client List', and clicking the 'label' button next to the device.",
      "The MAX BR2 Pro requires a total of 8 antennas for optimal performance, with 4 antennas designated for each of its 2 cellular SIM slots. A user has connected 4 roof antennas to SIM slots 1A and 2A, while using paddle antennas for the remaining ports. It is suggested that the roof antennas could potentially be connected to all ports of Cell 1, while paddle antennas could be used for Cell 2, but the optimal configuration may depend on the specific firmware version and antenna requirements for 5G connectivity.",
      "For improving cellular performance in an RV setup, transitioning from a Verizon 8800 Jetpack to a MAX BR1 Cat-20 is advisable. The BR1 Pro CAT 20 and the BR1 Pro 5G are both excellent devices, with the latter offering future-proofing for 5G capabilities.

    "query": "For optimal 5G connectivity and performance using a Peplink MAX BR1 Pro 5G with Mobility 42G antennas, what factors should a technician consider regarding antenna selection, placement, and configuration, and what are the consequences of improper setup?",
    "answer": "For optimal 5G performance with a Peplink MAX BR1 Pro 5G and Mobility 42G antennas, the technician should use all four identical antennas, as the modem uses 4x4 MIMO technology and each port (A, B, C, D) is required for full bandwidth and carrier aggregation. Antenna selection should match the bands used by the local towers, such as 850MHz and 3700MHz for 5G, and panel-style MIMO directional antennas are often preferable to Yagis for close proximity to towers. Antennas should be oriented in the same direction and do not require significant separation; mixing antenna types or leaving ports unconnected can degrade performance. Using only two antennas instead of four will significantly decrease available bandwidth. Additionally, placement and cable length matter: cables should be kept as short as possible to minimize signal loss, and over-gaining antennas may not help when close to towers. Mixing different antennas or failing to match them to the frequency bands can reduce SINR and overall throughput, as observed in user reports. Matching antennas to the local environment and ensuring proper connection to all four ports is essential for maximizing 5G connectivity and stability.",

If the device continues to use the original port for handshaking, it is recommended to open a support ticket for further assistance.\n\n## Document_2\n\nIP Passthrough is a feature supported only in a single cellular model and is not available in the BR2 Pro. This information has been updated to reflect the correct feature availability.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe MAX BR1 and MAX BR2 models support IP passthrough mode for cellular WAN connectivity.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe router installed in a metallic water-proof box outdoors is experiencing high temperatures around 80℃, which exceeds the specified operational temperature range of -40° to 65°C. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to ventilate the box, potentially using forced air, or relocate the router to a cooler environment, as prolonged exposure to high temperatures can reduce the mean time between failures (MTBF) of the equipment.\n\n## Document_5\n\nTo manage access to different SSIDs on a Pepwave Max BR1 5G, you can define a schedule and set that schedule per SSID, allowing you to turn off the personal AP during work hours when the connection is less than ideal.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Winegard 360+ antenna system is not suitable for use with the Pepwave Max BR1 Pro 5G due to its insufficient number of antenna elements and its design primarily for 4G/LTE frequencies. It is recommended to use a dedicated 5G antenna, such as the Peplink 42G antenna, which is 5G ready and includes GPS and WiFi capabilities for accessing public WiFi networks.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe user is experiencing issues with their Pepwave MAX BR2 PRO router, specifically related to the WAN to LAN port configuration being reset after changing WAN priority settings. This reset occurs after InControl2 updates the router's configuration, which seems to be incorrectly managing the WAN/LAN local port settings. The user notes that this behavior is new and has not occurred in the past, indicating a potential change in how InControl2 interacts with the device settings.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe Pepwave Max Transit Pro does not support traditional GSM cellular voice calls, but it does allow for SMS messaging and VoIP calls over data connections.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe operating temperature range for the Pepwave Max Transit Duo LTEA is between -40°C and +65°C, as specified in the product data sheet. When enclosing the device in a weather-proof box, it may be necessary to consider a case with ventilation depending on the external environment.\n\n## Document_10\n\nSprint does not activate data plans on commercial router devices like the Pepwave Max Transit LTEA Cat 18. The pricing for data plans on such devices is typically higher than consumer hotspot plans, with costs around $6.00 to $9.00 per gigabyte being more realistic.\n\n## Document_11\n\nPepVPN will continue to function even if PrimeCare is not renewed for a Pepwave MAX Transit CAT 18, although SpeedFusion will not work without an active PrimeCare subscription.\n\n## Document_12\n\nA well-ventilated Pepwave MAX Transit Duo can have a surface temperature of up to 60°C (140°F) when it is busy. Monitoring the temperature through the web UI can provide additional insights into its operating temperature.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Pepwave MAX Transit models can operate at warmer temperatures, which is normal due to the design where the metal case acts as a heatsink for the internal circuitry. Even in cold environments, the units may feel warm to the touch, indicating typical operational behavior rather than overheating.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe Pepwave MAX BR1 Pro does not support converting the WAN port to a LAN port, which means it cannot be configured to provide additional LAN ports beyond the default number available.\n\n## Document_15\n\nTo resolve issues with a Pepwave Max Mobile Router not displaying daily data usage for previous days, it is recommended to check the firmware version and upgrade to the latest firmware if it is not already being used.\n\n## Document_16\n\nFor configuring multiple Pepwave Max BR1 devices, the InControl2 cloud management platform can be used to store configurations in the cloud and push them to all devices, facilitating pre-staging of configurations.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe Pepwave Max Transit Cat-18 has been certified for use by Verizon for some time. For updates on 5G devices, it is suggested to contact Peplink directly.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Cricket plan is compatible with Pepwave Max Transit devices, specifically the Max Transit Duo, providing a potential unlimited data solution for users.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe Cricket unlimited plan is compatible with Pepwave Max Transit devices and has been reported to work as intended by users.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe Pepwave MAX Transit Mini is now certified for use on the Verizon network, indicating compatibility with Verizon SIM cards for authentication.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo use Pepwave Max devices with Google's ProjectFi, it is important to ensure that roaming is enabled in the Peplink settings to avoid any connectivity issues.\n\n## Document_22\n\nWhen a router is installed in a metallic water-proof box outdoors, it can experience excessive heat, with reported temperatures around 80°C, which exceeds the operational temperature range of -40° to 65°C specified in the data sheet. To mitigate overheating, it is recommended to implement solar shading, add heat sinks, and consider forced air cooling.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThere is an issue with the Peplink MAX BR2 PRO where changes to the WAN to LAN port configuration are being reset to default after modifying WAN priority settings. This behavior appears to be linked to InControl2, which is automatically updating configurations and causing the loss of connection. Users have reported that this issue started recently and affects their ability to manage WAN/LAN settings effectively, leading to connectivity problems for multiple devices.\n\n## Document_24\n\nThe user experienced issues with their MAX BR2 PRO router where the WAN to LAN configuration was reset to default after changing WAN priority settings. This reset was linked to InControl2 updating the router's configuration automatically, which was not expected as the user had not enabled InControl to manage device-specific port settings. After reconfiguring the WAN to LAN setting, the user noted that the changes remained intact for a period without being overridden by InControl, suggesting a potential temporary resolution to the issue.\n\n## Document_25\n\nThe Pepwave Max Transit LTEA Cat 18 is compatible with Sprint, but users may face challenges activating it with certain Sprint hotspot plans. Entering the Max Transit's IMEI on Sprint's activation page may result in an error indicating that the device cannot be activated. Users have expressed concerns about the high cost of data plans for quality routers compared to cheaper hotspot devices, which can lead to frustration, especially in rural areas with limited internet options.\n\n## Document_26\n\nCricket offers a 100 GB data plan for Pepwave Max Transit Cat 18 devices, priced at $90 per month, along with additional options of 40 GB for $50 and 20 GB for $35. These plans provide high-speed data access for browsing, streaming, and downloads, but do not include calling. Additionally, AT&T offers business data plans with varying speeds and prices: $80/month for 8 Mbps, $130/month for 12 Mbps, $200/month for 50 Mbps, and $300/month for 100 Mbps. These business plans are not intended for streaming video or entertainment, but provide unlimited data capped at the specified plan speed.\n\n## Document_27\n\nTo connect a Pepwave BR1 mini to Google's Project Fi, first access the cellular connection settings and ensure the Network Selection is set to Auto. Then, restrict the connection to the carrier by scanning for available networks, where Project Fi should appear alongside others like Sprint and Verizon. In the APN settings, change to custom and input 'h2g2' as the APN to establish the connection successfully.\n\n## Document_28\n\nUsing a data-only Project Fi SIM with Pepwave Max devices outside of the US can present challenges, particularly with network recognition and connection stability. Users have reported seeing a 'Project F' network in the US, but this is not available in countries like France or Spain. When attempting to connect, selecting various local carriers such as Free, Vodafone ES, Orange, YOIGO, Movistar, GIBTEL, and Shine has not yielded success, with the connection status often stuck on 'Obtaining IP address'. The antenna status fluctuates between showing strong signal bars and none, indicating potential issues with network compatibility or settings. The device consistently reports the carrier as T-Mobile and the region as the United States, which may affect connectivity.\n\n## Document_29\n\nFor using Pepwave Max devices with Google's Project Fi, the correct APN to configure is h2g2. It is also recommended to enable roaming for the BR2 cellular WAN during testing. If connection issues persist despite enabling roaming, it is advised to open a support ticket for further assistance.\n\n## Document_30\n\nPepwave Max devices can be used with Google's ProjectFi, and it is recommended to set the APN to h2g2. For devices shipped out of the country, it is advisable to activate the SIM card in a US device first to ensure data activation. The BR1 MINI APAC unit is suitable for use in the Philippines, and it is important to check the device's ability for data roaming, as it will automatically select a partner cellular network based on roaming agreements.\n\n## Document_31\n\nWhen attempting to use Google Fi with a Pepwave BR1 device in Spain, the device shows available networks but fails to connect, getting stuck at 'obtaining DHCP address' despite having the correct APN settings. The same SIM card works correctly in a tablet with the same APN and network, indicating a potential issue specific to the BR1 device.\n\n",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nThe Peplink Balance 380 HW5 has a maximum router throughput of 200Mbps, which is insufficient given the combined WAN speeds of 200Mbps, 150Mbps, and 120Mbps. The device is experiencing saturation at 150Mbps due to its limitations. For improved performance, it is recommended to upgrade to a newer model, such as the Balance 380 HW6, which supports 1Gbps Stateful Firewall Throughput.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 and 30 routers are limited to approximately 200mb throughput, which creates a bottleneck for users in areas where gigabit download speeds are being rolled out. The current lineup of Peplink routers does not support gigabit throughput until the 300 series and higher. This limitation affects small business and residential users who expect to utilize gigabit service without significant speed loss, as they may experience a 40% drop in speed when using these routers.\n\n## Document_3\n\nA Peplink Balance 20 or 30 can combine both DSL and cable internet connections for load balancing and automatic failover, ensuring continuous connectivity. The AP One access points are suitable for enhancing wireless coverage in larger homes, utilizing TruePower RF technology for increased signal strength. The AP One operates on the 2.4GHz band, while the AP One mini supports 5GHz, which may require compatible devices for optimal performance.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Peplink Balance 30 is rated for a maximum throughput of 100Mbps for both upload and download speeds. If the combined speeds of the connected ISPs exceed this limit, performance issues may arise due to bottlenecking. For higher throughput needs, upgrading to a Peplink Balance 380, which supports up to 170Mbps, is recommended. The Peplink Balance can provide benefits such as traffic prioritization through load balancing, quality of service (QoS) assignment on an application or port level, and hardware firewall capabilities, enhancing overall network performance and flexibility.\n\n## Document_5\n\nTo implement a better internet service in a poorly serviced area using Peplink products, it is possible to set up a Peplink Balance 210 in a data center to serve a single client with a high-speed fiber connection. The Balance 210 can handle a bonded VPN throughput of 30 Mbit/sec, which is suitable if no other clients are served from that device. For the client side, a Peplink Balance 580 is recommended to manage multiple ADSL lines, each providing 2.2 Mbit/sec down and 0.5 Mbit/sec up, creating a site-to-site VPN that would produce a combined traffic capacity of 11 Mbit/sec down and 2.5 Mbit/sec up at the data center.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThere is a configuration migration tool available for migrating settings between the Peplink Balance 30L and Balance 20 models, but it is not publicly accessible and can be obtained through Peplink support.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe Peplink Balance 210, an older model, has been tested with dual 200M links resulting in bonded tunnel speeds of 85-90Mbps, which is below the specified 150Mbps. The implementation of the onboard OpenVPN client through the bonded tunnel is limited, as traffic through SpeedFusion can be rejected by services like Cloudflare. The Balance 310 and newer models, such as the Balance 310 5G, utilize a faster system-on-chip (SoC) and can achieve SpeedFusion throughput of 600-700Mbps, despite being rated for 500Mbps. Encryption can add overhead, affecting performance. Peplink supports OpenVPN and IPSec VPN, but SpeedFusion is recommended for optimal performance and can be set up with virtual units like FusionHub Solo.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe Peplink Balance 310 5G offers no limitations on speed, providing download speeds between 170 to 240 Mbps and upload speeds of 90 Mbps, which is a significant improvement compared to the Balance 20X LTE connections that were limited to around 100 Mbps.\n\n## Document_9\n\nIn a network setup involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via a star topology, issues may arise with route advertisement to Azure through IP Sec VPN tunnels. The Balance 508 may not be advertising its routes to the connected Balance 305 devices, which can prevent satellite sites from accessing Azure. Additionally, static routes may need to connect to gateways within the same subnet, which can complicate configurations if sites are not willing to share a common subnet.\n\n## Document_10\n\nIn a network configuration involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 routers connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is important to ensure that outbound rules are correctly set up for traffic to traverse from the satellite sites to Azure. The Balance 508 needs to properly advertise its routes to the connected 305 devices for successful end-to-end connectivity.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Peplink Balance 210, specifically hardware revision 4, has an encrypted SpeedFusion throughput rated at 80Mbps, while the throughput can reach 150Mbps if encryption is disabled. The straight WAN routing throughput for this model is 350Mbps. The Balance One has a maximum SpeedFusion throughput of 60Mbps with encryption and 30Mbps without, making it less capable for bonding multiple connections compared to the Balance 210. For full utilization of three 80Mbps connections, a Balance 710 is required, which supports 400Mbps of SpeedFusion throughput. An out-of-contract Balance 210 can still use a Solo SpeedFusion license, but it requires manual configuration for the SpeedFusion VPN, as it cannot be managed remotely via InControl 2. Vultr is recommended for low-cost SpeedFusion hosting, with the capability of handling significant data volumes.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe Balance 210 router has a maximum throughput capability of 350Mbps, but when using SpeedFusion, the throughput is limited to 80Mbps for encrypted connections and 150Mbps for unencrypted connections. Users may experience issues with streaming services like Netflix blocking access due to the use of VPN server farms, which are often flagged for copyright infringement. For affordable SpeedFusion hosts, UpCloud is recommended as a viable alternative to Vultr, offering similar pricing and satisfactory performance.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe SpeedFusion throughput on the Balance 210 HW1 is limited by hardware and cannot be increased through firmware upgrades. The device has a total router throughput of 50Mbps, with 30Mbps available for encrypted VPN throughput. The Balance 210 HW1 can still be managed locally through its gateway IP address, and it supports firmware version 5.4.9, which was released on May 30, 2013. Users should be cautious when using this outdated firmware in production due to the lack of modern features and security updates.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe issue with the Ethernet Port status display showing incorrect information on the Balance 310XX Series has been fixed in the 8.1.0 beta 1 build. Users are advised to upgrade to 8.1.0 beta 4 to resolve this issue.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Peplink Balance B1 does not have an integrated DSL modem, meaning a separate modem is required to connect a DSL line to the Balance device.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe Peplink Balance 310 has a WAN to LAN router throughput rating of 100 Mbps, which is the sum of simultaneous upload and download speeds across all WAN connections. A fiber optic internet connection with 200 Mbps download speed exceeds the capacity of the Balance 310, potentially leading to undesirable performance issues. However, the newer Balance 210/310 models (HW revision 4) are expected to see a performance increase with the upcoming 6.2.1 firmware.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe Peplink Balance 310 has a specified router throughput of 100Mbps, which refers to its firewall/router capabilities. In contrast, the Balance 210 Hardware version 4 supports a higher firewall/router throughput of 350Mbps and a PepVPN throughput of 80Mbps.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Peplink Balance 310 has a maximum throughput of 200 Mbps, which limits the ability to aggregate multiple WAN connections to achieve higher speeds. However, using a more recent model like the Balance 380 or 305 could allow for up to 1 Gbps throughput, provided that the ISPs are balanced equally. To achieve a combined speed of 600 Mbps with three 200 Mbps connections, traffic must consist of separate concurrent sessions that can be distributed evenly across the WANs by the balancing algorithms.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe default login credentials for the Peplink Balance 1 router are username 'admin' and password 'admin'.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe maximum throughput of the Peplink Balance 310 HW1 is 100 Mbps, and it cannot be upgraded past firmware version 5.x.x. The device is no longer officially supported by Peplink, and upgrading to a newer model is recommended if higher throughput or newer features are desired.\n\n## Document_21\n\nThe Peplink Balance 310 hardware revision 2 has a maximum throughput of 50Mbps, which is the limit being experienced during large data transfers. The rated throughput of 350Mbps mentioned in documentation is likely an aggregation of all WAN ports under optimal conditions, not reflective of the actual performance of the older hardware. Upgrading to a newer model router is recommended for improved bandwidth capabilities.\n\n## Document_22\n\nThe Peplink Balance One has a maximum throughput of 400 mb/s when using three WAN connections in Load Balance mode, meaning that the combined download speeds will not exceed this limit. To achieve a total download speed of 525 mb/s with three 175 mbps connections, a more robust solution would be required, such as using two Balance One Core units to aggregate bandwidth effectively. This setup involves connecting two WANs to one Balance Core unit and the third WAN to another Balance Core unit, allowing for better management of the aggregated bandwidth.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe Balance 310 hardware revision 1 has a throughput rating of 50 Mbps, while the latest revision 3 supports up to 200 Mbps. For inquiries regarding upgrade or replacement programs, contacting Peplink sales directly is recommended.\n\n## Document_24\n\nIt is possible to perform a configuration conversion between Peplink Balance 300 and Balance 380 devices. Users can send the configuration file from the Balance 300 to Peplink's technical support team for assistance with the conversion process.\n\n## Document_25\n\nThe Peplink Rugged AP supports Power over Ethernet (PoE) only on the first port, which is used as an input to power the device. The second port does not provide pass-through PoE or activation for powering other devices such as a security camera.\n\n## Document_26\n\nThe Surf SOHO does not support Band Steering, a feature that is available on Peplink Balance models 20, 30, and above. This means that devices connected to the Surf SOHO will join either the 2.4GHz or 5GHz band arbitrarily, which can lead to suboptimal performance, especially when trying to manage devices that require different frequency bands.\n\n## Document_27\n\nThe Balance ONE and CORE models from Peplink support throughput of up to 600Mbps, which is reduced to 400Mbps when using five WAN connections. These models have been successfully used with 1Gbps/200Mbps links for three years without issues.\n\n## Document_28\n\nPeplink Balance devices can combine two internet connections (DSL and Cable) for load balancing and can also set one connection as a backup. Traffic prioritization and bandwidth limiting for certain users are features available on the Balance 380 or higher models. The AP One can improve wireless signal strength and can be managed remotely via a web admin page accessible from the WAN side, using dynamic DNS if a static IP is not available. The AP One X can repeat a signal from an indoor AP One if there is a good wireless connection between them, but performance may vary based on several factors that require an on-site survey to assess.\n\n## Document_29\n\nPeplink Balance routers, such as the Balance 20 and 30, can combine multiple internet connections, including DSL and Cable, for load balancing. They also support failover configurations, allowing one connection to be active while the other serves as a backup. Traffic prioritization for specific IPs can be managed through Quality of Service (QoS) settings. The AP One wireless access points can work with the Balance 30 or 310, and they can be set up individually. Additionally, the Balance WLAN Controller feature is available on Balance 380 and above, providing centralized management for both WAN and WLAN needs.\n\n## Document_30\n\nTo combine two internet connections (DSL and Cable) for load balancing, a Peplink Balance 20 or 30 can be used. These devices can also be configured for failover, allowing one connection to remain active while the other is used only when the primary fails. Traffic prioritization for specific IPs is possible, and remote management is supported. For wireless access points, the AP One can work with the Balance 30 or 310, but it is important to check compatibility and setup individually. The APs operate in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, which can help mitigate interference issues in environments with congested 2.4 GHz bands.\n\n## Document_31\n\nFor implementing a better internet service in a poorly serviced area using Peplink products, a Peplink Site-to-Site VPN is suitable for connecting the data center with the client end. This setup allows for bonding WAN links, which can enhance the overall internet service by combining multiple connections. Further details on VPN bonding can be found on the Peplink website.\n\n## Document_32\n\nTo implement a better internet service in a poorly serviced area using Peplink products, it is possible to deploy a Peplink appliance at both the data center and the client end to achieve a Site-to-Site VPN. A recommended configuration includes using a Peplink Balance 710 for the data center and a Balance 580 for the client site. For further technical specifications, users can refer to the Peplink website.\n\n## Document_33\n\nTo implement a better internet service in a poorly serviced area using Peplink products, it is possible to use bandwidth bonding technology. A Peplink Balance 210 or above is required at the client end to bond multiple ADSL connections into a single internet pipe, achieving a maximum upstream of 2.5Mbps and downstream of 11Mbps. For the data center, a Peplink Balance 1350 is recommended, which supports a bonded throughput of 350Mbps, suitable for a high-speed fiber connection of 200Mbps throughput.\n\n## Document_34\n\nThe Peplink 210 Rev 4 has been tested with two 200M links, resulting in bonded tunnel speeds of 85-90M, which is below the specified 150M. The onboard OpenVPN client cannot be run through the bonded tunnel, leading to issues with traffic being rejected by Cloudflare. While traffic selectors are available for applications like Zoom and Teams with the SpeedFusion Cloud (SFC), similar selectors are not available in FusionHub. Detailed information on active connections is not usable as selectors, indicating limitations in the device's implementation and VPN capabilities.\n\n## Document_35\n\nIn a network configuration involving PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is noted that IP Sec tunnels do not typically advertise their routes through second hops. To enable connectivity from satellite sites to Azure, a static route for the Azure subnet can be added on the satellite devices, pointing to the Balance 508. Additionally, firewall configurations on both the satellite sites and Azure may need to be reviewed to ensure they allow the necessary traffic exchange.\n\n## Document_36\n\nTo enable connectivity from PepLink Balance 305 devices to Azure through a Balance 508, static routes can be configured on the Balance 305 for the Azure subnet, using the Balance 508 as the gateway. Additionally, the Azure configuration should include a static route for the Balance 305 subnet, also using the Balance 508 as the gateway. It is important to ensure that firewall rules on both ends permit this routing to function correctly.\n\n## Document_37\n\nThe outbound policy configuration on the PepLink Balance 508 was successfully adjusted, allowing the connected Balance 305 devices to traverse to Azure through the established IP Sec VPN tunnels. This indicates that proper routing and policy settings are essential for enabling connectivity between satellite sites and Azure.\n\n## Document_38\n\nThe Balance 210 has a maximum throughput of 80 Mbps, which indicates that if three 80 Mbps connections are bonded, the expected maximum speed remains around 80 Mbps. Upgrading to a Balance One could potentially allow for greater bandwidth utilization. A Solo SpeedFusion license can still be used with the Balance 210 even if it is out of contract. For low-cost SpeedFusion hosting options, while Vultr is mentioned, there may be other similarly priced services suitable for SpeedFusion that can accommodate approximately 300 GB per month.\n\n## Document_39\n\nThe Balance 210 has a maximum throughput of 80 Mbps, which indicates that if three 80 Mbps connections are bonded, the maximum speed achievable would still be around 80 Mbps. Upgrading to a Balance One would allow for higher bandwidth utilization. A Solo SpeedFusion license can be used with the Balance 210 even if it is out of contract. For low-cost SpeedFusion hosting options, users may consider services similar to Vultr that are priced competitively and suitable for SpeedFusion, with a usage estimate of around 300GB per month.\n\n",

For the data center, a Peplink Balance 1350 is recommended, which supports a bonded throughput of 350Mbps, suitable for a high-speed fiber connection of 200Mbps throughput.",
      "The Peplink 210 Rev 4 has been tested with two 200M links, resulting in bonded tunnel speeds of 85-90M, which is below the specified 150M. The onboard OpenVPN client cannot be run through the bonded tunnel, leading to issues with traffic being rejected by Cloudflare. While traffic selectors are available for applications like Zoom and Teams with the SpeedFusion Cloud (SFC), similar selectors are not available in FusionHub. Detailed information on active connections is not usable as selectors, indicating limitations in the device's implementation and VPN capabilities.",
      "In a network configuration involving PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is noted that IP Sec tunnels do not typically advertise their routes through second hops. To enable connectivity from satellite sites to Azure, a static route for the Azure subnet can be added on the satellite devices, pointing to the Balance 508. Additionally, firewall configurations on both the satellite sites and Azure may need to be reviewed to ensure they allow the necessary traffic exchange.",
      "To enable connectivity from PepLink Balance 305 devices to Azure through a Balance 508, static routes can be configured on the Balance 305 for the Azure subnet, using the Balance 508 as the gateway. Additionally, the Azure configuration should include a static route for the Balance 305 subnet, also using the Balance 508 as the gateway. It is important to ensure that firewall rules on both ends permit this routing to function correctly.",
      "The outbound policy configuration on the PepLink Balance 508 was successfully adjusted, allowing the connected Balance 305 devices to traverse to Azure through the established IP Sec VPN tunnels. This indicates that proper routing and policy settings are essential for enabling connectivity between satellite sites and Azure.",
      "The Balance 210 has a maximum throughput of 80 Mbps, which indicates that if three 80 Mbps connections are bonded, the expected maximum speed remains around 80 Mbps. Upgrading to a Balance One could potentially allow for greater bandwidth utilization. A Solo SpeedFusion license can still be used with the Balance 210 even if it is out of contract. For low-cost SpeedFusion hosting options, while Vultr is mentioned, there may be other similarly priced services suitable for SpeedFusion that can accommodate approximately 300 GB per month.",

    "query": "How do throughput limitations and hardware revisions of Peplink Balance 210 and 310 models affect their performance when bonding multiple WAN connections, and what upgrade recommendations are provided for users needing higher aggregate speeds?",
    "answer": "The throughput limitations and hardware revisions of the Peplink Balance 210 and 310 models significantly constrain their ability to utilize the full bandwidth of multiple WAN connections when bonding. The Balance 210 HW4 has a maximum straight WAN routing throughput of 350Mbps, but SpeedFusion VPN throughput is limited to 80Mbps encrypted and 150Mbps unencrypted. Earlier revisions (HW1) are even more limited, with only 50Mbps total router throughput and 30Mbps for encrypted VPN. The Balance 310’s throughput varies by hardware revision: HW1 is capped at 50Mbps, HW3 at 200Mbps, and some sources reference a 100Mbps WAN-to-LAN rating for certain revisions. These limitations mean that when bonding multiple WANs (e.g., three 80Mbps lines), the aggregate speed is still capped by the device’s throughput limit (e.g., 80Mbps for the 210 HW4). For users who require higher aggregate speeds (e.g., to fully utilize gigabit or multiple high-speed WANs), upgrading to newer models such as the Balance 380 HW6 (1Gbps throughput), Balance One/Core (400-600Mbps), or Balance 310 5G (170–240Mbps download) is recommended. These newer models offer significantly higher throughput, better hardware, and support for modern features, enabling users to take full advantage of faster internet connections and advanced bonding capabilities.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nThe Peplink Balance 30PRO model includes a Wi-Fi interface, allowing for wireless connections and SSID broadcasting, whereas the Balance 30LTE model does not have a Wi-Fi interface and only supports AP Controller functionality. If the wireless connection is enabled but the SSID is not visible, it is important to confirm the specific model of the Balance 30 being used.\n\n## Document_2\n\nTo direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on a Peplink Balance 20/30 series router, navigate to the Network settings and set the Outbound Policy to 'Managed by Custom Rules'. Retain the default rules 'HTTPS Persistence' and 'Default', and then add new rules to enforce traffic from specific LAN clients to designated WANs. After creating the rules, ensure to click 'Save' and then 'Apply Changes' to implement them.\n\n## Document_3\n\nTo troubleshoot issues with setting up a PPTP server on a Peplink Balance 380, it is important to ensure that the device is running the latest firmware. If problems persist, submitting a support ticket along with a diagnostic report is recommended for further assistance.\n\n## Document_4\n\nTo enable the PPTP server settings on a Peplink Balance 380, it is recommended to confirm and update the firmware to the latest release (5.3.9) using the built-in firmware checker under System > Firmware > Firmware update. If the issue persists after updating, capturing a diagnostic report while the issue occurs (but before rebooting) is advised to preserve the Event Logs for further review by support.\n\n## Document_5\n\nIn a SpeedFusion VPN setup, Site A can operate with a single uplink while still supporting a mobile client with multiple uplinks. The bandwidth available to the mobile client is determined by Site A's upload capacity, as it provides the download for the mobile client. Therefore, it is important for Site A to have sufficient bandwidth to meet the demands of the mobile client, regardless of the number of uplinks at either end.\n\n## Document_6\n\nAfter switching from a Balance 30 LTE to a Balance 20X router, network printers (HP 5740) went offline, and errors occurred when attempting to print. Windows can detect the printers and install their drivers, but printing fails. There are known issues with Windows updates causing problems with network printing, particularly after recent updates, which may be contributing to the issue. Testing with older versions of Windows could help determine if the router is the source of the problem.\n\n## Document_7\n\nWhen using a Peplink Balance 30 Pro with a Verizon SIM to serve a network of over 100 computers, issues with throughput may arise despite good ping times and download speeds when only a few devices are connected. Potential causes for the low throughput could include the limitations of the Verizon plan being used, as many mobile data plans are not designed for enterprise router use. It is advisable to check traffic statistics to identify if any single device is consuming excessive bandwidth and to conduct tests with fewer devices to isolate the issue.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe Balance 30 LTEA has been updated and renamed to Balance 30 Pro, featuring a new hardware revision that includes CAT6 LTE-Advanced, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and 4x PoE LAN ports. The classic Balance 30 LTE retains its CAT3 LTE configuration, while the new Balance 30 Pro offers enhanced capabilities with LTE-Advanced technology.\n\n## Document_9\n\nWhen using a Balance 78A3 router on a gigabit Ethernet LAN with a 200 Mb Spectrum service, if only 9 Mbps internet speeds are observed, it may indicate an issue with the router's configuration or compatibility with the ISP's equipment. The router's port speeds should be set to 1 Gbps Full Duplex, but if it only operates at 100 Mbps, testing with a gigabit switch between the Balance 78A3 and the ISP router could help identify potential incompatibilities.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Peplink Balance 300, which is approximately 15 years old, supports a maximum throughput of 20Mbps. Therefore, if clients are experiencing a maximum speed of 15Mbps, this is within the expected performance limits of the device, despite having three WAN connections with a total potential speed of 300Mbps.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Balance 300 router supports a maximum throughput of 20mbps per user, despite having three WAN connections each capable of 100mbps. This means that while the total potential speed from the WAN connections is 300mbps, the router's limitations restrict the actual usable speed to 20mbps per user, indicating that the additional bandwidth from the WAN connections is not utilized effectively.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo aggregate bandwidth between three sites using Peplink solutions, the Balance 1350 can be deployed, which supports 350 Mbps of SpeedFusion VPN throughput. The expected combined bandwidth between Plant 2 and Plant 3 is approximately 165 Mbps, while the VPN to Plant 1 can achieve around 103 Mbps, leading to a potential total of 268 Mbps for simultaneous upload/download SpeedFusion VPN throughput. It is recommended to use layer 3 SpeedFusion VPNs, accounting for about 10% overhead due to encryption, and to consider new features in firmware version 6.2, such as WAN smoothing, for improved performance.\n\n## Document_13\n\nTo set up a Point to Point PepLink VPN tunnel between Balance 210-A and Balance 210-C, it is necessary to use custom handshake and data ports for PepVPN on Balance 210-C. These ports must be forwarded through Balance 210-B. The PepVPN profile on Balance 210-A should be configured to connect to the public IP of Balance 210-B using the specified custom ports.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe latest firmware for the Peplink Balance 20W is v4.8.1, and this model has been obsoleted. Users are advised to consider refreshing their router for updated features and support.\n\n## Document_15\n\nIn the context of configuring a Peplink Balance 50, the Advertise speed option is important as it informs the connected device of the speed configuration on the Peplink. This is particularly useful when the connected device is set to 'Auto' for port speed, ensuring proper communication and performance.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo upgrade a Peplink Balance 580 from firmware version 5.3.12, the next available version is 5.4.9, with version 6.2 also available. Upgrading from version 5.x to 6.x requires an unlock key, which can be obtained by ensuring the device is under warranty and opening a support ticket. Release notes for version 6.2 provide information on new features, improvements, and resolved issues, which can be accessed through the provided link.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe Peplink Balance e30 is not a DSL modem and does not have RJ11 ports; it only features RJ45 Ethernet ports. To connect the Balance router to an ADSL connection, a separate DSL modem is required that provides an Ethernet output to connect to the Balance's WAN port.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Peplink Balance 580 can be upgraded from firmware version 5.3.12 to version 5.4.9 without the need for an unlock key, and the firmware can be downloaded directly from the Peplink website.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe Peplink Balance 1350 supports only one VLAN, necessitating a layer 3 switch for additional VLAN configurations. With firmware release 6.1, multiple LAN subnets will be supported. The Balance 1350 can manage up to 20 access points (APs) without an additional license, while a license is required for controlling between 21 and 500 APs. The device is scalable and can handle over 5000 users, accommodating future growth needs.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe Balance 380 has a router throughput rating of 200 Mbps, which indicates that the combined WAN upload and download speeds can potentially exceed this limit, leading to undesirable behavior. Although the router should sustain 75 Mbps of throughput, high CPU load can occur under certain conditions, affecting performance and causing issues such as failed admin page requests and internet unavailability for other users. It is advisable to open a support ticket for further investigation.\n\n## Document_21\n\nThe firmware files \"fw-b210_310_hw1-5.4.7-build1920.bin\" and \"fw-b210_310_hw2_hw3-5.4.7-build1493.bin\" correspond to different hardware revisions of the Balance 210/310. The \"hw2\" firmware should be used if the Balance 210/310 has a USB port for 4G/3G WAN.\n\n## Document_22\n\nThe Pepwave BR1 is a fail-over only device, meaning it can only route traffic through a single interface at any given time. For simultaneous routing of traffic through both the WAN and LTE ports, a different model such as the Balance 30 LTE or a multi-cellular router would be required for load balancing capabilities.\n\n## Document_23\n\nWhen encountering an 'Invalid Default Interim Interval' error while adjusting bandwidth management values on firmware 3.5.2 build 1537, it is important to ensure that the configured value falls within the allowed range of 60 to 2678400. Additionally, if the device is showing as offline in InControl, it is recommended to verify that the access points can reach the specified Peplink servers (ac1.peplink.com, ac2.peplink.com, ra1-1.peplink.com, ra1-2.peplink.com) using the ping test. Furthermore, ensure that outbound UDP port 5246 and TCP port 443 are open on the firewall, and confirm that the access point is allowed to be managed by InControl2 via the controller settings.\n\n## Document_24\n\nThe Pepwave Balance 580X with firmware 8.4.0 supports Starlink integration, allowing users to view event logs from the Starlink antenna. However, issues with this feature may arise if the other setups are not also using the Balance 580X or if a management IP is not defined on the WAN.\n\n## Document_25\n\nTo direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on the Peplink Balance 20/30 series, outbound policy can be utilized to control which server or type of traffic exits through which link. This ensures that return traffic comes back on the same link it was sent out on, maintaining the integrity of sessions such as FTP. If an FTP session is established on WAN1, Peplink will consistently route that FTP traffic through WAN1.\n\n## Document_26\n\nTo direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on a Peplink Balance 20/30 series router, an outbound policy rule can be created. This allows for the configuration of traffic routing, ensuring that certain types of traffic, such as FTP, are directed through a designated WAN connection without round-robin switching between multiple WANs.\n\n## Document_27\n\nTo direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on the Peplink Balance 20/30 series, it is important to explore the outbound policy settings rather than inbound rules. The outbound policy allows for the configuration of rules that can route traffic from specific devices or applications to designated WAN connections, ensuring that certain traffic, such as FTP, is consistently routed through the intended WAN without round-robin switching between multiple connections.\n\n## Document_28\n\nThe Balance 20/30 series allows for the configuration of outbound policy rules to direct specific traffic through designated WAN connections. The default outbound policy rule, set to 'Auto', utilizes a weighted balance algorithm based on the downstream bandwidth of each WAN. Users can customize this setting by changing it to 'Custom' to create specific rules for directing traffic, ensuring that certain machines, such as a server for FTP traffic, can be configured to use only a designated WAN connection without round-robin distribution between multiple WANs.\n\n## Document_29\n\nThe BPL-031-LTEA-W-T is End of Life (EOL) under that specific SKU, but the same device is still available under the part number BPL-031-LTE-US-T. This indicates that while one version may be discontinued, a similar or equivalent version remains on the market.\n\n## Document_30\n\nTo aggregate bandwidth between three sites using Peplink solutions, SpeedFusion is recommended as it allows for session persistence and effective fail-over capabilities. The wireless connections between Plant 2 and Plant 3 can provide a combined bandwidth of approximately 80 Mbps in each direction. The Balance 710 routers support up to 160 Mbps of SpeedFusion VPN throughput, which is suitable for simultaneous use of bandwidth in both directions. Additionally, new features in the SpeedFusion 6.2 firmware may enhance network performance.\n\n## Document_31\n\nTo set up a Point to Point PepLink VPN tunnel between Balance 210-A and Balance 210-C, it is important to note that a custom handshake port feature is not currently available. The handshake port is global to all profiles on the device and cannot be set through the existing PepVPN management UI.\n\n## Document_32\n\nIf excessive emails about WAN1 connection issues are received after upgrading to a Balance 50 and updating the firmware, it is important to note that the errors in the event log may indicate a physical connection issue rather than health check failures. To potentially resolve this, locking the port speed to 100M Full Duplex is recommended.\n\n## Document_33\n\nTo troubleshoot excessive emails regarding WAN1 connection issues on a Peplink Balance 50, it is recommended to check the power status of the modem connected to WAN1, inspect the physical cable for WAN1, and consider swapping the WAN1 interface to WAN3 to further investigate the problem.\n\n## Document_34\n\nUpgrading from firmware version 5.3.12 to 5.4.9 on a Peplink Balance 580 provides improved stability.

    "query": "How can outbound policy on the Peplink Balance 20/30 series be used to ensure that FTP traffic from specific servers is consistently routed through a designated WAN connection, and what are the steps and implications of customizing these rules?",
    "answer": "On the Peplink Balance 20/30 series, outbound policy rules allow you to direct traffic—such as FTP—from specific servers to a particular WAN connection. This prevents traffic from being distributed in round-robin fashion across multiple WANs, maintaining session integrity for protocols like FTP. To implement this, navigate to the Network settings and set Outbound Policy to 'Managed by Custom Rules', keeping the default 'HTTPS Persistence' and 'Default' rules. You can then add new rules specifying that traffic from particular LAN clients (such as FTP servers) uses a designated WAN. After making these changes, you must click 'Save' and then 'Apply Changes' for the rules to take effect. By customizing outbound policy, you ensure that return traffic follows the same path, crucial for FTP session reliability, as the Peplink will always route FTP sessions through the specified WAN, avoiding problems caused by round-robin switching.",

If the reset button is not accessible, users may face challenges in performing a factory reset, which is typically necessary to regain access to the device if the login information cannot be retrieved.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe MediaFast 500 supports all 8 load balancing algorithms, contrary to the initial impression that it only supports 7. This indicates that the specifications for the MediaFast family may not be fully representative of its capabilities regarding load balancing algorithms.\n\n## Document_3\n\nTo regain access to a Pepwave device after being locked out from both WAN and LAN access, one option is to add the device to InControl for remote management, which is a safer alternative to using the WAN IP Address. This involves creating an InControl organization, adding a group name, and inputting the device's serial number to manage it remotely.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Peplink Balance family of routers shares a common user manual, which can be accessed online at the provided link. This manual includes information relevant to the Balance Two Unit as well as other models in the family.\n\n## Document_5\n\nTo regain access to a Pepwave device after a password change error, one can either factory default the unit or use InControl2 (IC2) to change the password.\n\n## Document_6\n\nTo regain access to a Peplink 360 device if the admin password is lost and the display interface is disabled, one can use InControl (IC2) if the device is managed through it to access the web-admin. Alternatively, instructions for resetting the web admin password can be found in a specific forum post.\n\n## Document_7\n\nTo regain access to a Pepwave device when the Web Admin login credentials are not working, one can attempt to access the device via InControl2 if it is online. If the device is offline, connecting a network cable to the WAN port may bring it online in InControl2, allowing for remote access to change the password.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe Peplink Balance Series does not support TR-069, but users can manage their devices using InControl2, which is Peplink's network management solution.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThere is a configuration migration tool available for migrating settings between the Peplink Balance 30L and Balance 20 models, but it is not publicly accessible and can be obtained through Peplink support.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo address the issue of a Peplink Balance 30 Pro LTE failing to obtain an IP address after switching back from WAN1 to the 4G connection, it is important to check the health check settings configured for the 4G connection.

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nT-Mobile's 100 gig plan is reported to be incompatible with the Pepwave Max Transit Duo, as users may encounter issues such as the 'Obtaining IP Address' message. The Max Transit Duo can be set up as a repeater for other hotspots, such as the Inseego, which may serve as a workaround. It is noted that T-Mobile primarily uses 5G technology, while other carriers like Verizon still provide 4G LTE, which is compatible with the Max Transit Duo. Users are advised to verify the compatibility of T-Mobile's bands with the device's available bands and consider filing support tickets with Peplink or escalating issues with T-Mobile for better resolution.\n\n## Document_2\n\nT-Mobile's 100 gig plan has been reported to have compatibility issues with the Pepwave Max Transit Duo, specifically resulting in an 'Obtaining IP Address' message. In contrast, other carriers like Verizon offer 4G LTE, which is compatible with the Max Transit Duo. Testing with T-Mobile plans has shown that they work with Peplink devices equipped with Cat4, Cat6, CAT12, and 5G modems, but not with CAT18. An escalated tech support suggested a different plan for CAT18, which was declined.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe T-Mobile 100 gig plan is reported to be incompatible with the Pepwave Max Transit Duo, as users have experienced issues such as the 'Obtaining IP Address' message. In contrast, other carriers like Verizon, which still offer 4G LTE, are compatible with the Max Transit Duo. However, there are claims from other users that the T-Mobile plan works without issues on the Max Transit Duo and Max Transit CAT18 devices, indicating potential variability in user experiences.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe T-Mobile 100 gig plan may not be compatible with the Pepwave Max Transit Duo, as indicated by issues with obtaining an IP address. In contrast, the Max Transit 5G can successfully utilize both 5G and 4G LTE bands without issues. Users should be cautious about claims regarding service degradation after reaching data limits, as experiences may vary significantly between carriers.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe T-Mobile 100GB hotspot plan is reportedly only compatible with T-Mobile-supplied hardware, such as the Inseego hotspot, and may not work with the Pepwave Max Transit Duo. Users have experienced issues such as the 'Obtaining IP Address' message when attempting to use this plan with the Max Transit Duo. Additionally, there are concerns that the service may become unusable after reaching the data limit, contrary to what was promised by sales representatives. It is suggested that Verizon may be a better option for compatibility with the Max Transit Duo, as they still offer 4G LTE services.\n\n## Document_6\n\nWhen using the Pepwave Max Transit Duo with various SIM cards from Verizon and AT&T, it is important to note that many of these plans are subject to network management, which can lead to deprioritization in congested areas. Users have reported success with the old Mobley $20/month unlimited plan, which allows for high data usage. For reliable connectivity, especially in busy areas, considering a more expensive plan that does not deprioritize may be necessary.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe Pepwave BR1 Max Pro 5G may not recognize certain SIM cards, such as the AT&T unlimited prepaid plan, even if the SIM is activated and functional in other devices. Users have reported that SIM cards from other data devices can sometimes work in Peplink devices, even if those devices are not certified for the specific network. It is advisable to check the certification status of devices on the respective carrier's network to ensure compatibility.\n\n## Document_8\n\nFor users of the Pepwave MAX Transit Duo seeking alternative carrier options, it is possible to use an AT&T prepaid plan specifically designed for mobile hotspots and tablets, which offers 100GB for $55. Users have reported success with this plan, although initial activation issues may occur if the wrong plan is selected. The SIM card used for this plan may be blue/white and labeled for 5G, which could indicate compatibility with 5G devices, although testing on such devices has not been confirmed. Users should ensure they are activating the correct plan to avoid connectivity issues.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe AT&T data-only plan may not be compatible with the Pepwave MAX Transit Duo, as indicated by the user's experience with tech support. However, the $55/100GB prepaid plan from T-Mobile has been successfully tested on various Pepwave devices, including the TST DUO Pro-E, 310X, and HD2, without issues. The user suggests that the plan works for LTE and LTE-A, although they have not tested it on 5G devices yet. The conversation highlights the importance of verifying compatibility with specific plans and devices before committing to a service.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe $55 100GB AT&T prepaid plan works well with the Pepwave MAX Transit Cat 18, and the user provided the IMEI during the signup process. However, there is uncertainty regarding the compatibility of the AT&T unlimited elite plan with the device.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Pepwave MAX Transit Duo CAT12 can be compatible with various carriers, as confirmed by successful activation of data-only SIM cards from Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile. Verizon offers a 15GB data-only postpaid plan for $20 per month, which requires no special setup beyond inserting the SIM card. T-Mobile provides a 100GB data-only postpaid plan for $50 per month, which requires activation via SMS, accessible through the router's SIM Toolkit feature. AT&T offers a 20GB hotspot/data-only prepaid plan for $25 per month for one year, although a SIM adapter may be necessary if a micro-SIM is provided. The user plans to utilize T-Mobile as the primary connection, with Verizon and AT&T as backup options due to their lower data allowances and costs.\n\n## Document_12\n\nWhen using an AT&T SIM card in a Pepwave MAX Transit Cat 18, it is suggested to consider using a more expensive phone plan like Unlimited Elite instead of a cheaper tablet plan, as there may be upcoming restrictions on the tablet plan due to abuse. There are concerns about potential IMEI mismatches being targeted by AT&T, which could affect users who modify their devices to circumvent restrictions.\n\n## Document_13\n\nTo resolve issues with an AT&T SIM not being recognized by the Pepwave BR1 Max Pro 5G, it is recommended to upgrade the firmware of the device, as this can help with SIM auto-negotiation of the APN. Initial setup and configuration are best accomplished with a PC connected via Ethernet for more reliable access.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe Pepwave BR1 Max Pro 5G can only maintain an active connection with one SIM card at a time, despite having two SIM card slots. When the primary SIM (T-Mobile) runs out of data, the device will automatically failover to the secondary SIM (AT&T), which is the intended functionality. Users can check the connection details for both SIM cards in the Cellular WAN settings, but only one will be active at any given time. For simultaneous active connections from two SIMs, a different Peplink device is required.\n\n## Document_15\n\nFor users experiencing issues with T-Mobile SIM cards in a Pepwave MAX Transit Duo, it is noted that some users have successfully used T-Mobile and AT&T plans in their devices. Specifically, a user reported that the T-Mobile 100GB for $50 plan works well in their MAX Transit Pro, and they also have had success with AT&T prepaid plans. However, the original poster is facing difficulties with their T-Mobile SIM being stuck on 'Obtaining IP Address' despite compatibility confirmation from tech support. This suggests that while some users have had positive experiences, there may be specific compatibility or configuration issues affecting others.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe user is experiencing issues with their Pepwave MAX Transit Duo's compatibility with various cellular carriers. They initially had an AT&T plan that was canceled due to excessive domestic roaming. They attempted to switch to a Verizon data-only plan but are seeking more data and redundancy. After confirming compatibility with T-Mobile, they received a SIM that remains stuck on 'Obtaining IP Address' despite attempts to troubleshoot. The user is looking for practical solutions to use their Duo with non-Verizon carriers, as they are concerned about the device becoming obsolete without a reliable cellular plan.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThere is conflicting information regarding the compatibility of the AT&T unlimited elite plan with the Pepwave MAX Transit Cat-18. Users have reported varying experiences, with some stating it works well while others mention potential IMEI locking issues. Additionally, a user experienced disconnections due to tower maintenance but found stability after the work was completed. They also switched from using SmartCheck to HTTP, suggesting that AT&T may prefer web browsing activity for connection stability.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe AT&T unlimited elite plan can work with the Pepwave MAX Transit Cat-18 without issues, as long as the correct IMEI number is provided to the carrier. Users have reported no problems when presenting the IMEI at the store, and there was no inquiry about the type of device being used.\n\n",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nThe Peplink Balance 310X does not support IP passthrough on WAN and cellular according to the firmware version 8.1.3 build 5162.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe Peplink Balance 310X supports IP forwarding on the WAN side. To enable IP forwarding, users need to access the WAN connection settings and click on the question mark icon for guidance on the next steps.\n\n## Document_3\n\nTo enable access to network resources for PPTP users on a Peplink 380, it is necessary to create an inbound firewall rule. The source should be set to the internal network, while the destination can be configured based on desired access: for internal network access only, set the destination to the internal network; for internet browsing capability, set the destination to 'Any'.\n\n## Document_4\n\nTo enable access to devices on a LAN through a PPTP VPN connection on a Peplink Balance 20, it is necessary to create an inbound firewall rule that allows traffic from the VPN source IP range to the LAN destination IP range. The rule should specify the WAN connection as 'Any', the protocol as 'Any', and set the source and destination IPs and masks to match the LAN addressing. This configuration allows VPN users to access endpoints on the LAN, which may not be accessible by default.\n\n## Document_5\n\nTo enable PPTP clients to access internal resources on a Peplink Balance 310, it is necessary to configure an inbound firewall rule. This rule should allow traffic from the internal network to the desired destination, which can either be set to 'Any' for internet browsing or 'Local network' to restrict access to only local resources without internet browsing through the WAN connections.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Peplink Balance 30 does not have a limit on the number of SIP endpoints that can be registered. If there are issues with registering more than 20 endpoints, it is recommended to capture a diagnostic report from the Balance while the issue occurs and submit it for support review.\n\n## Document_7\n\nAfter upgrading a Peplink Balance 30 from firmware version 6 to version 8, issues with communication to access points may arise due to changes in VLAN and routing configurations. Performing a factory reset can help resolve potential incompatibilities with the old configuration, potentially restoring functionality with the access points.\n\n## Document_8\n\nTo enable full network access for a remote PC connected via L2TP VPN to a Peplink Balance 30, it is necessary to adjust the firewall settings. Specifically, an inbound firewall rule should be created that allows traffic from the VPN source (the LAN subnet) to the destination (the entire LAN or specific devices) with the action set to allow. This rule should be enabled and configured to apply to the WAN connection used for the VPN.\n\n## Document_9\n\nFor monitoring a Peplink Balance 580 using Zabbix with SNMP, Peplink provides a Management Information Base (MIB) file for versions 4.x to 5.x, which can be downloaded from their website. However, there is no specific Zabbix template supported by Peplink for this purpose.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo enable a remote host connected via PPTP to access hosts on a local area network (LAN) through a Peplink Balance 20, it is necessary to create an Allow rule in the firewall settings. This rule should have the source set to 'Any', the destination set to 'Network', the protocol set to 'Any', and the action set to 'Allow'. Additionally, ensure that the remote host's PPTP settings include the option 'Use remote gateway for default gateway' to facilitate proper routing. It is also important to check that no local firewalls, such as Windows Firewall, are blocking connectivity from the remote host.\n\n## Document_11\n\nTo allow PPTP clients to see all devices on the 192.168.10.0/24 network when connected, an inbound firewall rule should be created on the Peplink Balance. The rule should specify the source as 192.168.10.0/24, the destination as Any, and the action as Allow. This configuration enables PPTP clients to access devices on the network and also allows them to reach the internet without requiring NAT mapping for the PPTP server.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo troubleshoot port forwarding issues on a network with a Balance 20, it is suggested to temporarily reset firewall rules to their default settings, allowing all inbound and outbound traffic. This can help confirm whether the port forwarding configuration is functioning correctly. Additionally, the internal web server is accessible via its local IP address, but the public IP address times out, indicating a potential misconfiguration in the firewall or port forwarding settings.\n\n## Document_13\n\nFor successful port forwarding to an internal web server at 192.168.0.249, ensure that the default gateway on the web server is set to the Peplink Balance LAN IP address (192.168.0.4). This configuration is essential for the server to communicate properly with external traffic. Additionally, when using PPTP, if local internet access is lost and visibility to the network past the VPN device is restricted, it may indicate a misconfiguration in the VPN settings or firewall rules that need to be reviewed.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo set up an inbound firewall rule for a Balance 30 PPTP server, create a rule with the following settings: Rule Name as 'PPTP', enable it, set WAN Connection to 'Any', Protocol to 'Any', Source IP & Port to '192.168.1.0' with a mask of '255.255.255.0', and Destination IP & Port to the same '192.168.1.0' with the same mask. Change the source and destination addressing to match your LAN addressing. This configuration allows VPN access to endpoints on the LAN, not just the Balance 30 itself.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Peplink Balance 580 currently does not support an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). It has a USB interface, but there are no options in the web interface for UPS support. The user mentions using an APC Smart-UPS X LCD 750VA, indicating a specific UPS model that is not compatible with the Peplink 580 due to the lack of a serial interface.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo effectively use the Pepwave MAX 700 for bonding multiple 4G MiFi dongles for live video streaming, a PepLink Load Balancing router is needed at the office or data center for final data transfer. The MAX 700 can be pre-configured for automatic operation, reducing the need for on-site personnel during events. However, the current SpeedFusion technology may not be fully optimized for live streaming applications, as it can be affected by the slowest WAN link, leading to potential delays. The suggestion is made for Peplink to provide application-specific profiles to simplify configuration for users. Additionally, there are concerns about the need for buffering at the data center to manage reassembly delays during streaming.\n\n## Document_17\n\nFor live streaming with increased bandwidth, the Pepwave MAX On-The-Go or MAX 700 are suitable mobile routers that provide more bandwidth through multiple sessions or streams and offer instant fail-over between USB modems. To bond multiple USB modems for a single stream, SpeedFusion VPN bonding technology is required, necessitating a second SpeedFusion-enabled device at the headquarters or data center, with the Peplink Balance 380 being a recommended choice for this purpose.\n\n## Document_18\n\nTo block a domain for a specific VLAN, you can create firewall access rules in the advanced settings of your router. This involves setting up a new outbound firewall rule with the desired configuration, including specifying the source as the VLAN subnet and the destination as the domain name you wish to block. The action should be set to deny, and event logging can be enabled or disabled as preferred.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe user is experiencing limited wireless bandwidth, with no device exceeding 5Mbps download speed despite having a 32Mbps line and a 5Mbps fiber line connected through a Peplink Balance 310. The setup is in bridge mode, and the user has tested the connection directly through the ATT 32Mbps router, achieving a maximum of 6Mbps. The office environment is large and contains many walls, which may impact wireless signal strength and speed.\n\n## Document_20\n\nTo troubleshoot low wireless speeds when using a Peplink Balance 310 with a 32Mbps ATT WAN, it is recommended to connect a laptop directly to the WAN for a speed test, and then connect the WAN to an AP One and test again with the same laptop. This will help measure the effective bandwidth available over Wi-Fi. It is noted that Wi-Fi performance may yield lower speeds due to environmental factors such as walls and the layout of the office space.\n\n## Document_21\n\nIncontrol and InControl2 are distinct platforms, and there is currently no automated method for migrating devices from Incontrol to InControl2; the migration process must be performed manually.\n\n## Document_22\n\nTo log outgoing connections through an OfficePoint 400, Event Logging of Firewall rules must be enabled on a Balance router. For improved functionality, it is recommended to upgrade to the AP One series, as the OfficePoint 400 has been obsoleted.\n\n## Document_23\n\nTo verify if the Peplink Balance 310X supports IP passthrough on WAN and cellular, it is recommended to enable the Share Drop-In IP feature if there is insufficient public IP availability, such as when using a /30 subnet for the Drop-in WAN. Non Drop-in WANs also support /30 subnets without issues.\n\n## Document_24\n\nWhen using a Peplink Balance 20 configured for PPTP, users may experience issues accessing other devices on the LAN or browsing the internet despite being connected. To resolve this, it is suggested to configure both inbound and outbound firewall rules to Allow All. This should enable access to the LAN once the PPTP connection is established, but additional filtering or blocking on the LAN may also be affecting connectivity.\n\n## Document_25\n\nWhen configuring a Peplink Balance 20 for PPTP connections, if the remote client cannot connect to other devices on the LAN or browse the internet, it may be due to both the client and the LAN being on the same subnet. Changing the client's IP address to a different subnet, such as 192.168.2.x, could resolve the issue.\n\n## Document_26\n\nWhen configuring a Peplink Balance 20 for PPTP access, users may encounter issues connecting to other devices on the LAN, despite being able to access the admin page. This could be due to routing configurations, particularly if the local LAN and home LAN share the same subnet, which complicates traffic routing. It is suggested to create static routes on the client device to ensure traffic is directed through the VPN to the home LAN. Additionally, users should verify firewall rules, as they may need to be adjusted to allow traffic from the VPN to the LAN devices.\n\n## Document_27\n\nWhen using a Peplink Balance 20 configured for PPTP, users may connect to the home network and access the router's admin page, but may experience issues connecting to other LAN devices, such as failing to ping them or access services like RDP. This could indicate a need for specific firewall rules to be created, as the existing rules may not apply to PPTP connections as expected, despite the standard rule allowing all outgoing traffic.\n\n## Document_28\n\nWhen configuring a Peplink Balance 20 for PPTP access, users may encounter issues connecting to other devices on the LAN, despite being able to access the admin page. This may be due to the need for specific firewall rules to be created, as existing rules may not apply to PPTP connections in the same way they do for local connections. Users should ensure that appropriate firewall rules are set to allow traffic from the PPTP VPN to the LAN devices.\n\n## Document_29\n\nWhen using PPTP on a Peplink Balance 20, users may experience issues accessing local network devices and the internet despite being able to connect to the home network. This could be due to firewall rules that need to be configured, as existing rules may not apply to VPN connections. It is important to ensure that appropriate firewall rules are set to allow traffic from the VPN to local resources and the internet.\n\n## Document_30\n\nWhen configuring a Peplink Balance 20 for PPTP connections, users may encounter issues accessing other devices on the LAN, despite being able to connect to the home network and the admin page. This could be due to the need for specific firewall rules to be created, as existing rules may not apply to PPTP connections. Additionally, enabling InterVlan routing has been suggested as a potential solution, but may not resolve the connectivity issues on its own.\n\n## Document_31\n\nWhen using L2TP VPN on a Peplink Balance 30, it is normal for the remote PC to initially appear isolated from the rest of the network, indicated by a padlock icon. To enable access to the entire network from the remote PC, it is important to review the Internal Network Firewall Rules in the admin panel and ensure that there are no Deny rules that could be blocking access.\n\n## Document_32\n\nTo stream live video using the MAX 700 by bonding multiple 4G MiFi dongles, a Peplink router is required at the office or datacenter to terminate the SpeedFusion bonded VPN. This router can be pre-configured for automatic operation, eliminating the need for a person to monitor it during events. Compatibility with specific modems like the Huawei E303 USB Modem or the Huawei E586 MiFi Dongle may require additional support, and remote assistance can be enabled for driver development if the modems are not currently supported.\n\n## Document_33\n\nThe MAX 700 can bond up to 4 USB dongles for streaming live video, and an additional Wi-Fi connection can be used as a WAN to achieve a total of 5 connections. For optimal performance, having a PepLink Load Balancing router at the office or data center is recommended to manage the final upload. The router can be pre-configured for automatic operation, eliminating the need for constant monitoring during events.\n\n",

    "query": "What are the necessary firewall rule configurations to enable a remote PPTP or L2TP VPN client to access all devices on the LAN and browse the internet on Peplink Balance 20 and Balance 30 routers, and what common issues may prevent this access?",
    "answer": "To allow a remote PPTP or L2TP VPN client to access all LAN devices and browse the internet on Peplink Balance 20 and Balance 30, you must create inbound firewall rules that explicitly allow traffic from the VPN source (the PPTP or L2TP subnet) to the LAN subnet. The rule should apply to the WAN connection used for the VPN, with protocol set to 'Any', and both source and destination IP ranges matching the LAN addressing. For full internet access, set the destination to 'Any'; for LAN-only access, restrict the destination to the LAN subnet.

For optimal performance and reliability in HA configurations, it is recommended to use units that are the same model and firmware version.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe Peplink Balance 580 has three hardware revisions (HW). For optimal High Availability (HA) pairing, it is recommended to use either a pair of Balance 580 with HW1, which supports firmware version 6.3.4, or a pair with HW2/3, which supports firmware version 7.0.1. Mixing these two options requires using the latest firmware supported by both units, which is 6.3.4. Performance improvements are noted in the newer hardware platforms, indicating potential performance differences in a production environment when using different hardware versions in an HA setup. Additionally, Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) features are not available on older hardware versions, but HA will function if these features are not enabled.\n\n## Document_4\n\nFor the PEPLINK 580, if the hardware revision is 1, it is possible to upgrade directly to firmware version 6.3.4. For hardware revisions 2-3, the direct upgrade is to firmware version 7.0.1. Users can determine their hardware revision by checking specific documentation provided in the forum.\n\n## Document_5\n\nIn a Peplink 380 setup with two WAN links, when using drop-in mode for the primary internet link (WAN 3), no additional configuration is required for inbound services to function. However, for the secondary internet link (WAN 2) operating in NAT mode, NAT mapping or inbound services must be configured to correspond with the outside IP addresses of the firewall for proper incoming traffic to internal servers.\n\n## Document_6\n\nFor the Peplink Balance 580 appliances, the latest firmware versions are 6.3.4 for HW1 and 7.1.1 for HW2. It is not possible to align both appliances to the same firmware version due to these limitations. However, it is possible to upgrade from firmware 6.3.1 directly to 7.1.2, and users are encouraged to use the latest firmware version available, which is 7.1.2.\n\n## Document_7\n\nUpgrading a Peplink device with different hardware revisions to different firmware versions (7.1.1 for the slave unit and 6.3.4 for the master unit) is not supported for High Availability (HA) configurations. A hardware refreshment for the old device is recommended to ensure compatibility.\n\n## Document_8\n\nTo upgrade a Peplink BPL-580 from firmware version 5.4.9, it is recommended to first upgrade to version 6.1.0 and then to 6.3.4. After upgrading to 6.3.4, the configuration from the older 580 HW1 can be migrated to the newer 580 running firmware version 7.1.0.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe performance between Peplink routers running firmware version 6.2.2 and those updated to 6.3 is very similar, suggesting that the upgrade may not be necessary for all users.

This will provide access to the 'Configuration Backups Download' option, which lists configuration dates and allows users to download the corresponding files for each configuration change.\n\n## Document_11\n\nWhen using a Peplink 580 to aggregate three 10Mbps ISP connections without load balancing, the total speed observed with a multi-session, multi-threaded speed test can reach 30Mbps. However, if SpeedFusion bonding is employed between the Peplink device and another Peplink device, the expected bonded bandwidth may be around 24Mbps, influenced by factors such as latency and the speed of the other device.\n\n## Document_12\n\nIt is possible to configure High Availability (HA) between two Peplink Balance 380 devices with different hardware revisions (Revision 5 and Revision 6). However, optimal performance is achieved when both devices have the same hardware revision. It is recommended to replace the older hardware to ensure reliable HA functionality.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Balance 580 Hardware Version 1 has been in the market since 2008 and supports up to firmware version 6.3.3. For users seeking new features, it is recommended to contact a Peplink local partner for hardware refreshment to upgrade to devices that support the latest firmware versions, starting from 7.0 and above. Additional information about the features in firmware 7.0 can be found in the release notes provided by Peplink.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo resolve issues with pinging hosts across a site-to-site VPN between two Peplink devices (BPL 210 and BPL 30), it is necessary to adjust the firewall settings. By default, the firewall may block traffic, so an inbound rule should be added to allow traffic from the LAN (e.g., 192.168.0.0/24) to any destination. This rule needs to be configured on both devices to enable communication between the networks.\n\n## Document_15\n\nHigh Availability (HA) can be set up between different hardware revisions of the Peplink Balance 380, provided that both devices are running the same firmware release.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo find the latest firmware for hardware revision 2, users should visit the Peplink website, navigate to the support section, and access the firmware downloads.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe latest firmware for the Pepwave MAX 700 (hardware version 1) is version 6.3.3 build 3231. To upgrade from firmware version 5 to 6, a free firmware license key can be obtained through the Peplink website. The differences between hardware versions 1, 2, and 3 of the MAX 700 primarily relate to performance and supported Wi-Fi technology, while functionality remains largely the same. Upgrading to firmware version 6 from version 5 provides bug fixes and feature improvements.

There are no restrictions on upgrading the firmware, and users can obtain a free firmware license key through the Peplink knowledge base. It is also important to check the hardware version of the device before performing the upgrade by accessing the Web UI and navigating to the Status section.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe latest firmware version available for the AP is 3.6.0s18, build 1848. Users can download this version from the provided link.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe LED indicators on the Ethernet port of the Surf SOHO router vary by hardware revision. For hardware revision 1, a solid green LED indicates a connection at 100Mbps, while it is off for a 10Mbps connection. The orange LED indicates that the port is connected but not transferring data when solid on, is off when disconnected, and blinks during data transfer. For hardware revision 2, a solid green LED indicates a connection at 1000Mbps, while it is off for 100/10Mbps connections. The orange LED functions the same as in revision 1, indicating connection status and data transfer activity.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo import a configuration file from an existing Surf Soho to a new Surf Soho MK3, the MK3 must be running firmware version 7 or later. This is a requirement for compatibility between the two hardware revisions.\n\n## Document_22\n\nTo allow the SpeedFusion Connect app to manage a router through InControl, navigate to the device in InControl, click the edit button, and uncheck the Configuration control checkbox for InControl located just below the Tags box. After making this change, click save to apply the settings.\n\n## Document_23\n\nTo create a configuration file for bulk configuration in Pepwave devices, first configure a target device to the desired settings. After saving the changes, download the config file from that device, which can then be used in the bulk configurator for applying the same settings to multiple devices.\n\n## Document_24\n\nConfiguration changes applied to devices managed by IC2 cloud should typically take 1 to 2 minutes to reflect at the device level, assuming the devices maintain a stable connection to the IC2 cloud.\n\n## Document_25\n\nThe MAX BR1 Mini LTEA-W-C1 is identified as a HW1 model, and the hardware version information can be found on the bottom left of the label on the box.\n\n## Document_26\n\nTo achieve true bonding and increased download speeds by combining multiple connections on a Peplink device, SpeedFusion technology is required, which can be implemented through a FusionHub or another Peplink device. The SpeedFusion dynamic link bonding has an overhead of 18 to 30%, meaning that even with two 500 Mbps connections, the combined speed will not exceed 800 Mbps. Currently, the Peplink SDX can only perform load balancing without SpeedFusion, and users are advised to consult their Peplink partner or forums for optimization guidance.\n\n## Document_27\n\nThe SpeedFusion Connect Relay feature allows users to connect devices behind private IP addresses without requiring a public IP, enhancing connectivity for mobile applications like RVs. The latest firmware version 8.3 introduces Layer 3 connectivity for SpeedFusion Connect Relay, which improves the ability to bridge private networks. Additionally, users can now switch between SIM cards dynamically through the InControl interface, allowing for better management of cellular connections. Connection tests can be configured to monitor network performance, providing daily speed tests and reporting results in a graphical format. The SpeedFusion Connect app simplifies management of SpeedFusion services, enabling users to subscribe to LTE data, manage SIM cards, and set outbound policies easily, catering to both consumer and enterprise needs.\n\n## Document_28\n\nFor the Balance 580 appliances, the latest official firmware versions are 6.3.4 for HW1 and 7.1.1 for HW2. It is not possible to align both appliances to the same firmware version due to the different latest firmware releases for each hardware version. Using different firmware versions on appliances can potentially lead to compatibility issues, especially in a SpeedFusion VPN setup. An archive link is available for downloading firmware 6.3.4 for HW2 from the official PepLink site.\n\n## Document_29\n\nWhen using a Peplink 580 with three ISPs each providing 10Mbps, WAN aggregation allows for multi-session traffic to achieve a combined speed of up to 30Mbps. However, for single-session traffic, such as accessing bank websites or HTTPS sites, the speed will be limited to the maximum of one ISP connection, which is 10Mbps. Speedtest.net typically operates with multi-session capabilities, allowing for this aggregation effect.\n\n## Document_30\n\nWhen creating a High Availability (HA) setup between a Peplink Balance 380 with Hardware Revision 5 and another unit with Hardware Revision 6, it is important to note that differences in hardware specifications, such as throughput, may affect performance during failover from the Master to the Slave unit.\n\n## Document_31\n\nThe Peplink BPL 210 and BPL 30 can establish a site-to-site VPN, indicated by a green VPN icon, allowing successful pings between the routers' LAN IPs.

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nThe video discusses the differences between the Starlink standard dish and the Starlink mini dish, both of which are designed for low earth orbit satellite broadband internet. The mini is smaller, lighter, and more portable, making it easier to install and use in remote locations. Both dishes have eliminated the need for a motor, reducing costs and power consumption, with the mini using about half the power of the standard dish. The mini features an embedded Wi-Fi 6 router, while the standard dish requires a separate router. Both dishes maintain a field of view of 110 degrees and are outdoor rated. The mini is priced higher in the U.S. market despite being designed for lower manufacturing costs, and it includes a kickstand, pipe adapter, and a 50-foot DC power cable, with the ability to be powered by various voltage sources. Users have found that voltage drop can affect performance, leading to experimentation with power supply methods.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe Starlink Mini is a portable satellite internet solution designed for ease of installation and mobility, featuring a compact design that allows for easy mounting on vehicles. It includes a 50-foot DC power cable and can be powered by a range of voltages from 12 to 48 volts, although users must be cautious of voltage drop over long cable lengths. The Mini has a built-in Wi-Fi router, but its Wi-Fi capabilities are limited to Wi-Fi 5 with a range of approximately 1,200 square feet. In contrast, the Starlink Standard system is larger, includes separate components for the router, power supply, and satellite dish, and utilizes a power over Ethernet (PoE) system that requires specific equipment to function correctly. The Standard system's router supports Wi-Fi 6 and has a range of 3,200 square feet, providing better performance. Users are encouraged to utilize the Ethernet port on the Mini for improved connectivity when stationary, as the built-in Wi-Fi may not suffice in those scenarios.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe Starlink Gen 3 is a tri-band Wi-Fi 6 router with 4x4 MIMO technology, providing a range of 3200 square feet and two Ethernet LAN ports for direct connections. In contrast, the Starlink Mini operates on Wi-Fi 5 with dual-band 3x3 MIMO, offering a reduced range of 1200 square feet. The Mini has an Ethernet port but lacks Power over Ethernet capability without a third-party accessory. Users are encouraged to utilize the Ethernet port for improved performance instead of relying on the built-in Wi-Fi. The new Starlink models do not require precise aiming due to an increased number of satellites, allowing for more flexibility in positioning. Power consumption is significantly lower for the Mini, using about 600 watt-hours compared to the standard model's 1.25 kWh over 24 hours, making it more suitable for off-grid applications. Both models feature sleep functions to conserve power, and users can turn them off completely to save energy.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe video discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using the Starlink Mini versus the standard Starlink dish for mobile applications such as RVs and boats. The Mini is noted for its significantly lower power consumption, using about 600 watt-hours compared to 1.25 kWh for the standard dish under normal usage. Both dishes have a sleep function to save power, but turning them off completely is the most effective method for power savings. The standard dish generally outperforms the Mini in speed tests and handles obstructions better due to its larger antenna array, although both dishes can suffer from performance drops in congested areas depending on the service plan. The Mini's router range is limited, with a 50-foot power cord, and its Wi-Fi signal can be compromised by obstructions, particularly in metal vehicles. Users may need to consider using an Ethernet cable for better connectivity, especially in environments where the Mini's built-in router is inadequate.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe Starlink Mini's performance is significantly affected by its built-in router, which has limited Wi-Fi range, especially when installed in obstructive environments like RVs or boats with metal roofs. The Mini can achieve better speeds when connected via Ethernet to a more capable router, such as those from Peplink, which can combine Starlink with cellular signals for enhanced reliability and speed. Speed tests indicated that while the Mini's Wi-Fi performance could drop to as low as 10.4 Mbps, using Ethernet resulted in speeds exceeding 300 Mbps. The Mini's router is less effective than the standard Starlink system, but it can still deliver respectable performance when properly configured with external routers, allowing for better overall connectivity and functionality.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Starlink Mini offers performance close to the standard version, achieving speeds around 250 Mbps in optimal conditions, while consuming less power and being more portable. Users are advised to bypass the built-in router and connect directly via Ethernet to a more capable router, such as those from Peplink, to enhance performance and enable features like bonding Starlink with cellular signals for improved reliability and speed. The Mini can remain active while connected to an external router, allowing for easy reconnection and portability. Ethernet cable lengths can extend up to 300 feet, but power considerations are crucial, as the Mini requires a 48-volt power supply.

    "documents_text": "## Document_2\n\nFor bridging a WiFi connection for WAN, LTE failover, and supporting a wired WAN connection, the Pepwave MAX Transit Mini can be considered, although it has limitations. It operates only on 2.4GHz WiFi and has a maximum router throughput of 100Mbps, which is significantly slower than the MAX Transit model that offers 400Mbps. Additionally, the MAX Transit Mini is equipped with a CAT4 modem, which may not provide the same performance as higher category modems.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe user is experiencing significant slowdowns in internet speeds on a Max Transit Mini device with both T-Mobile and AT&T data plans, despite other devices in the same area achieving good speeds. The user has attempted various troubleshooting steps, including changing locations, switching SIM cards, and connecting via Ethernet, but has seen no improvement. This suggests a potential issue with the router configuration or the device itself, rather than the cellular networks or local WiFi.\n\n## Document_4\n\nWhen experiencing slow data speeds on a Pepwave Max Transit Mini with T-Mobile and AT&T plans, it is important to verify the specific plan details with the carrier, as different plans may have varying speed limitations. T-Mobile offers M2M/IOT plans that can be rate limited, which may affect performance. Carriers frequently adjust provisioning and Quality of Service (QoS), which can lead to unexpected changes in speed. It is advisable to have the ICCID, IMEI, and telephone number ready when contacting the carrier for support.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe Pepwave Transit models with Cat 12 modems support download speeds of up to 600 Mbps, while those with Cat 6 modems support speeds of up to 300 Mbps. The newest 'Pro' versions of the Pepwave Transit are equipped with Cat 12 modems.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe internet connection issues with the Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini LTE may be attributed to poor cellular signal quality, as indicated by low SINR (3.6 dB) and RSRQ values. To improve connectivity and speeds, it is recommended to reposition the antennas and ensure that both the cellular and diversity antennas are properly installed.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThere are two models of the Peplink Balance 20X: one with a CAT4 LTE modem (BPL-021X-LTE-US-T-PRM) and one with a CAT7 LTEA modem (BPL-021X-LTEA-US-T-PRM). The retail price for the CAT4 model is $449, while the CAT7 model retails for $549. There is typically no difference in cost between hardware versions, but different partners may stock different hardware versions, and customers may receive the latest version depending on the partner's ordering approach. It is important to compare the same models when checking prices to avoid confusion.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe Pepwave MAX Transit Mini is equipped with a CAT 4 modem, which may limit its performance compared to a smartphone that utilizes carrier aggregation and advanced modulation techniques. This difference in technology could explain why the speed test results on the router are significantly lower than those obtained through a mobile phone hotspot.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe Pepwave Max BR1 Mini is criticized for being underpowered for typical consumer use, particularly in RV settings. It features a CAT4 cellular modem, which is considered slow compared to newer standards, and operates on a single-band WiFi chipset limited to the 2.4GHz band without MIMO capabilities. This design leads to performance issues when using WiFi-WAN in conjunction with access point functions, as it requires alternating packet flows, which reduces overall performance. For better performance and reliability, alternatives such as the Max BR1 Pro 5G or Max Transit CAT18 are recommended, and using a separate device for WiFi access points is suggested for improved connectivity.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Pepwave MAX Transit Cat 18 does not require a PrimeCare subscription to enable Wi-Fi as WAN functionality. The maximum throughput achieved while using Wi-Fi as WAN can reach around 100 Mbps, depending on the proximity to the Starlink router and the configuration of the device.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Pepwave Max Transit Duo Cat 12 is experiencing slow and unstable speeds ranging from 1-10 Mbps, while a mobile phone connected to the same network achieves speeds of 40-100 Mbps. This discrepancy may be attributed to the modem capabilities, suggesting that the modem in the iPhone is superior to that in the Pepwave device.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe CAT12 and CAT18 modems in the Pepwave MAX Transit series use different cellular modems, with CAT12 and CAT18 both classified under LTE Advanced Pro standards. The router's maximum supported throughput is 400Mbps due to hardware limitations, despite the CAT18 modem's theoretical capability of 1.2Gbps download and 150Mbps upload. The advantages of the CAT18 modem include features like 4x4 MIMO and increased QAM modulation, which enhance performance in challenging locations. Additionally, technologies such as SpeedFusion, encryption, Forward Error Correction (FEC), and WAN smoothing introduce overhead that can further limit throughput.\n\n## Document_13\n\nCat 12 modems have a maximum download speed of 603 Mbps and upload speed of 102 Mbps, utilizing carrier aggregation across 2 or 4 channels, while Cat 18 modems can achieve 1174 Mbps download and approximately 150 Mbps upload with carrier aggregation across 2, 4, or 8 channels. Although Cat 18 modems are available, they are less common and more expensive than Cat 12 modems. Peplink's decision to use Cat 12 modems in the HD4-MBX is likely based on market demand and cost-effectiveness, as well as the current limitations of 4G coverage and the commercial viability of high-speed data plans.\n\n## Document_14\n\nIn the first image, outbound traffic on the Pepwave MAX Transit CAT-18 is being load balanced across all healthy links set to Priority 1, allowing for optimal use of available connections. In the second image, outbound traffic is exclusively routed through the cellular connection, with Wi-Fi WAN connections acting as a backup that activates only if the cellular connection fails. Users can modify how multiple active WAN links are utilized through the outbound policy settings on the Transit, with various load balancing algorithms available.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe new Pepwave MAX Transit model MAX-TST-GLTE-G-T-PRM features a Global Cat 18 modem, which offers improved speed and potentially different band support compared to the previous model MAX-TST-LTEA-K-T with a Cat 12 modem. However, specific regional compatibility differences between the two models are not detailed. An antenna with SKU - ACW-234 is available for purchase, which may be relevant for enhancing connectivity with the new model.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe maximum theoretical upload speed for the Pepwave MAX Transit Cat 18 is 37.5 Mbps, while the maximum download speed is 270.8 Mbps based on specific carrier frequency combinations. The device utilizes multiple antennas for both upload and download, and real-world performance on T-Mobile shows download speeds ranging from 20-40 Mbps during the day and 100-130 Mbps at night, with upload speeds around 10 Mbps. The user is also exploring AT&T service for potentially better performance.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe Max Transit Cat 18 device achieved a maximum download speed of 20.8 Mbps and an upload speed of 6.9 Mbps during testing with four included LTE antennas. Initially, the device was only showing LTE connectivity, but it later connected to LTE-A, displaying Band 12 at 700 MHz and Band 66. However, the speed on LTE-A was about half of that when connected solely on Band 66, and the device frequently reverted back to LTE from LTE-A during the test.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Pepwave MAX Transit CAT 18 modem uses aggregation for download speeds but only utilizes the primary band for uploads. The theoretical maximum upload speeds based on different bandwidths are as follows: 5MHz can achieve 18.75Mbps, 10MHz can reach 37.5Mbps, and 15MHz can provide 56.25Mbps. Real-world speeds may be lower than these theoretical values. For optimal performance with Yagi antennas, the specific configuration and number of antennas required would depend on the setup and the bands being used.\n\n## Document_19\n\nTo use a Pepwave MAX Transit LTEA with Cat 18 on the Verizon network, the device must be certified by Verizon, which is expected to happen in April according to a Peplink representative. Users have reported difficulties activating the device due to IMEI recognition issues with Verizon's system. A workaround suggested involves using an activated SIM card from a compatible device, such as a Sierra Wireless EM7455, with an adapter to temporarily get the MAX Transit functioning until certification is achieved.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe new Visible network has been reported to work with various Peplink devices equipped with CAT-4, CAT-18, and 5G modems. Users have noted that the Access Point Name (APN) has changed, with successful configurations using 'internet' and the default Verizon APN 'vzwinternet'. Speed tests indicated performance comparable to a standard Verizon plan, although results were based on a limited test environment in one locale.\n\n## Document_21\n\nWhen experiencing issues with a Pepwave Max Transit Pro Dual Modem (Cat-12) hanging on 'Connecting...' while using Visible, a common cause may be a misconfigured APN. It is recommended to seek assistance from MMH, as they are responsible for providing first-level support for Peplink products.\n\n## Document_22\n\nThe Pepwave Max Transit LTEA with the CAT-18 modem is currently undergoing Verizon certification, which is causing compatibility issues for activation on their network. It is suggested that users can temporarily use an active SIM card from a different device to bypass this issue. Additionally, IMEI checkers on carrier websites are noted to be unreliable, particularly for devices other than smartphones.\n\n## Document_23\n\nTo activate a Pepwave Max Transit LTEA with a CAT-18 modem on Verizon, it is important to verify with Verizon that the data plan supports a commercial router. If activation issues persist, checking compatibility with Verizon's network is essential, as some plans may not be compatible with such devices.\n\n## Document_24\n\nThe Pepwave MAX Transit Mini is now certified for use on the Verizon network, indicating compatibility with Verizon SIM cards for authentication.\n\n## Document_25\n\nIn a Pepwave MAX Transit MAX-TST-GLTE-G-T-PRM running firmware version 8.2.0, SpeedFusion and FusionHub profiles should automatically retry downed links if configured correctly. If multiple WANs are in an active state and included in a PepVPN profile with priority settings, they should return to use quickly after a failure. The configuration should allow for WANs to be kept in a standby state rather than remaining down indefinitely, indicating that there may be a configuration issue if the expected behavior is not occurring.\n\n## Document_26\n\nFor a portable internet solution suitable for events, a modified Pepwave Transit Duo Pro can be used by replacing the CAT7 modem with a CAT20 5G NR setup. This configuration allows for a stable connection using CAT20 and CAT12 modems from two different carriers. Additionally, utilizing SpeedFusion technology in a Google Cloud instance enables the teaming of the two modems for improved bandwidth and reliability.\n\n## Document_27\n\nThe Peplink Max BR1 Mini, launched in 2022, features an upgraded processor and memory, allowing for improved throughput of up to 300 megabits per second download and 50 megabits per second upload speeds, significantly enhancing performance compared to previous models. It operates on a Category 6 modem and supports multiple cellular networks, performing best on Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile. The device includes two LAN ports, a WAN port that can be assigned to a third LAN port, and dual SIM card slots for flexibility, although only one SIM can be active at a time. The BR1 Mini supports both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi, allowing for better connectivity options. It also features a GPS antenna port for location tracking and is powered via a 4-pin Molex connector or an AC adapter. The device runs on a continually updated operating system, ensuring security and feature enhancements over time, and includes a more user-friendly quick start guide for setup.\n\n## Document_28\n\nFor bridging a Wi-Fi connection for WAN, LTE failover, and supporting a wired WAN connection, the Pepwave MAX Transit Duo (CAT12) or the single CAT 18 modem MAX Transit are recommended devices commonly used for such applications.\n\n## Document_29\n\nTo improve speed on a router when experiencing low performance compared to a mobile hotspot, it may be beneficial to consider using an external antenna, especially in areas with poor reception. The user is currently experiencing speeds of only 5-6 Mbps on a 25 Mbps plan with Verizon, which indicates potential issues with the router's reception or configuration.\n\n## Document_30\n\nThe Pepwave Max Transit Duo Cat 12 is equipped with AT&T and T-Mobile data cards that do not have throttling or data limits. The user has created both 2.4G and 5G SSIDs but is experiencing slow and unstable speeds ranging from 1-10 mbps on the Pepwave, while their mobile phone achieves speeds of 40-100 mbps when disconnected from the Pepwave. No changes have been made to the basic settings in the admin panel since installation.\n\n## Document_31\n\nTo improve the speed and stability of the Pepwave Max Transit Duo Cat 12, both cellular plans should be set to priority 1 since they are unlimited. Removing the default HTTPS persistence rule in the outbound policy and changing the default rule to 'dynamic weighted balance' will enable load balancing across all WANs. Additionally, deleting the built-in SSID (PEPWAVE_6EC6) is recommended to reduce unnecessary overhead since custom SSIDs are already in use.\n\n## Document_32\n\nPeplink has opted for Cat 12 modems in the HD4-MBX due to the complexities and variations in frequency and modulation standards associated with the rollout of next-generation LTE and 5G technologies. The company aims to avoid exposing commercial customers to unproven technology by allowing the consumer market to saturate new systems first, ensuring that enterprise-grade solutions remain stable and reliable. The new EPX and MBX range is designed to be modular, which allows for future upgrades without compromising current performance.\n\n## Document_33\n\nPeplink has chosen to implement Cat 12 modems in the HD4-MBX due to the current market conditions where coverage and reliable service are prioritized over maximum throughput. The consensus is that while higher-rated modems like Cat 18 may offer better speeds, the demand for such speeds is not immediate in many operational areas. Cat 12 modems are considered to provide a good balance of performance and cost-effectiveness, making them suitable for current needs until a hardware refresh is warranted in the future.\n\n## Document_34\n\nThe discussion highlights the distinction between modem categories, specifically Cat 12 and Cat 18, in terms of coverage and speed. While Cat 18 modems theoretically offer higher throughput, the choice of Cat 12 modems in devices like the HD4-MBX may prioritize coverage over speed, which is crucial for users in areas with limited tower availability. The conversation also raises questions about the advantages of different modem categories in terms of coverage, particularly for RV travelers in regions where connectivity is challenging, suggesting that external antennas may play a significant role in improving signal reception regardless of modem category.\n\n## Document_35\n\nThe HD4-MBX features Cat 12 modems, which are lower rated compared to Cat 18 or higher modems that offer greater throughput. The dual 12 modems support bands 9 and 48, although specific information on these bands is not provided. Additionally, it is noted that FirstNet's band 71, which is associated with T-Mobile, is not included in the dual 12 specifications.\n\n## Document_36\n\nFor optimal performance with a Pepwave MAX Transit CAT-18, users can configure the router to prioritize connectivity options, such as WiFi WAN and cellular SIM cards. The router can be set to use WiFi WAN if available, and if not, it can switch to Cellular SIM #1, followed by Cellular SIM #2. The availability of these connections can be determined through configurable tests like ping or DNS checks, allowing for a seamless transition between different WAN options based on their status.\n\n## Document_37\n\nThe MAX-TST-GLTE-G-T-PRM model features a Global Cat 18 modem which requires four antenna connections, presenting a challenge for fitting these onto the connector plate in the MAX Transit range. As a result, a Cat-18 DUO model is unlikely to be produced. The MAX Transit DUO Cat-12 model remains a suitable alternative for those needing a dual modem in a compact form factor. For users seeking a Cat-18 option, the new MBX HD2 with Cat-18 is recommended as a suitable alternative to the MAX Transit DUO.\n\n## Document_38\n\nThe MAX-TST-GLTE-G-T-PRM model features a Global Cat 18 modem, which offers improved speed and potentially different band support compared to the previous MAX-TST-LTEA-K-T model with a Cat 12 modem. However, specific regions where the Cat 18 modem may not function while the Cat 12 does are not detailed. Additionally, the CAT 18 EXM Mini Module does not come with its own antennas, necessitating the purchase of compatible antennas from Peplink.\n\n## Document_39\n\nThe MAX Transit Cat 18 device has a maximum upload speed of 150 Mbps and a maximum download speed of 1.2 Gbps, with a total router throughput of 400 Mbps. It utilizes multiple antennas for both uploading and downloading, as indicated by its four LTE antenna ports. While it is possible to use fewer than four antennas, the performance may be affected, potentially resulting in the device falling back to LTE-A modes similar to Cat-6 or Cat-12 versions if not all antennas are connected. The package contents for the MAX Transit include two 2dBi 4G LTE antennas, while the MAX Transit Duo includes four 2dBi 4G LTE antennas.\n\n## Document_40\n\nThe maximum upload speed for the Pepwave MAX Transit Cat 18 is not specified in the conversation. The device utilizes multiple antennas for both uploading and downloading. For optimal performance with Yagi antennas, it is not necessary to have four separate Yagi antennas; instead, one can use a pair or even a single Yagi antenna with a Y-connector. The Primary RF Antenna #1 and Secondary RF Antenna #1 do not support the bands 4, 12, 66, and 71, which are relevant for the user's T-Mobile SIM, indicating that connecting those antennas will not improve performance until additional bands are supported by the tower.\n\n## Document_41\n\nThe upload speed on the Pepwave MAX Transit Cat 18 can vary significantly depending on the band used; for instance, using LTE-A with band 12 as primary and band 66 as secondary results in slower upload speeds compared to using band 66 alone. The device can drop out of LTE-A mode into LTE mode intermittently, affecting performance. Currently, locking the device to band 66 yields better performance.\n\n",

    "query": "Why might a Pepwave MAX Transit Mini consistently deliver lower speeds than smartphones or higher-tier Pepwave models, even when using the same cellular network and similar conditions, and what are the recommended solutions for users needing higher performance?",
    "answer": "The Pepwave MAX Transit Mini often delivers slower speeds than smartphones or higher-end Pepwave models due to several hardware limitations. It is equipped with a CAT4 modem, which does not support advanced features like carrier aggregation and higher-order modulation found in more recent modem categories. As a result, its maximum router throughput is capped at 100 Mbps, and its cellular performance is generally inferior to that of smartphones and newer routers equipped with CAT6, CAT12, or CAT18 modems. The Mini also only operates on 2.4GHz WiFi, further limiting its wireless performance. Additionally, the device’s hardware may not keep up with the demands of modern networks, and its single-band WiFi without MIMO reduces WiFi-WAN and access point efficiency. For users requiring higher speeds or better reliability, it is recommended to upgrade to devices such as the MAX Transit (CAT12 or CAT18), MAX Transit Duo, Max BR1 Pro 5G, or use a separate device for WiFi access point functions. External antennas may also help if poor reception is a contributing factor.",

    "query": "When MAX BR1 units appear offline in InControl2 while working locally, what multi-layered troubleshooting steps should a technician follow, considering both device and network-level factors?",
    "answer": "When MAX BR1 units show as offline in InControl2 but operate normally from the local perspective, technicians should follow a multi-layered troubleshooting approach. First, verify that the device's InControl2 subscription or warranty is active, as connectivity may be affected if these have lapsed. Next, check if the required ports (UDP 5246 and TCP 443/5246) are open and not blocked by the ISP, since access to InControl2 servers depends on these being available. Intermittent ISP port blocking can also cause such issues, so confirm port access from the client side. Investigate DNS configuration: ensure that DNS filtering is not preventing the device from resolving InControl2 servers and, if necessary, switch to a reliable DNS service (such as Google DNS). If all network settings are correct and the issue persists, resetting the device to factory settings can temporarily restore connectivity, indicating a network-level problem rather than a device fault. Finally, if issues continue after these checks, open a support ticket with Peplink and enable Remote Access for further diagnostics.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nWhen comparing router throughput for home use, the PepLink Balance 20X offers a throughput of 900Mbps, which is a suitable option for handling multiple devices including 4 PCs, NAS, and additional smart devices. Other PepLink models mentioned include BalanceOne at 600Mbps, BalanceTwo at 1000Mbps, Surf SOHO MK3 at 300Mbps, and Balance 30 Pro at 400Mbps, providing various options depending on bandwidth needs.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a throughput speed that can vary between 100 Mbps and 150 Mbps, which may depend on factors such as firmware or hardware configurations. To verify the actual throughput speed, it is recommended to test the connection directly to the WAN using a PC, rather than through a gigabit rated switch.\n\n## Document_3\n\nTo direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on a Peplink Balance 20/30 series router, navigate to the Network settings and set the Outbound Policy to 'Managed by Custom Rules'. Retain the default rules 'HTTPS Persistence' and 'Default', and then add new rules to enforce traffic from specific LAN clients to designated WANs. After creating the rules, ensure to click 'Save' and then 'Apply Changes' to implement them.\n\n## Document_4\n\nTo direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on the Peplink Balance 20/30 series, it is important to explore the outbound policy settings rather than inbound rules. The outbound policy allows for the configuration of rules that can route traffic from specific devices or applications to designated WAN connections, ensuring that certain traffic, such as FTP, is consistently routed through the intended WAN without round-robin switching between multiple connections.\n\n## Document_5\n\nIn a setup with two Peplink Balance 200 routers, the Slave unit reports WAN disconnections even while in standby mode, which should not occur. Additionally, DNS issues may arise on Peplink devices, including the Balance 380, where websites fail to load due to DNS problems that can be resolved by reversing the DNS entries on the WAN side without needing to restart the devices.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 is suitable for small business use with up to 25 users, but the recommended user count is a guideline rather than a strict limit. Important factors to monitor include the throughput rating, which should be compared to the actual traffic load, and potential performance issues such as slow speeds or high CPU load if the device is stressed. The Balance 20 supports two WAN connections and has a throughput of 100Mbps, which is adequate given the current upstream speeds of 10Mbps and 25Mbps. Features like SpeedFusion and VPN are not required for this setup, and the user is not segmenting traffic or using advanced QoS settings.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 and 30 routers are rated for 100 Mbps of throughput, which includes both upload and download speeds. They support various types of WAN connections, including Ethernet and USB, although some USB connections may require a firmware update. The Balance series is designed to handle multiple WAN connections, ensuring seamless failover in case one connection drops.\n\n## Document_8\n\nTo flush the DNS on a Peplink Balance Core, the only current methods are to wait for the DNS records to expire or to reboot the device. Improvements to this process are planned for the future.\n\n## Document_9\n\nAfter switching from a Balance 30 LTE to a Balance 20X router, network printers (HP 5740) went offline, and errors occurred when attempting to print. Windows can detect the printers and install their drivers, but printing fails. There are known issues with Windows updates causing problems with network printing, particularly after recent updates, which may be contributing to the issue. Testing with older versions of Windows could help determine if the router is the source of the problem.\n\n## Document_10\n\nIn a network configuration involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 routers connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is important to ensure that outbound rules are correctly set up for traffic to traverse from the satellite sites to Azure. The Balance 508 needs to properly advertise its routes to the connected 305 devices for successful end-to-end connectivity.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe outbound policy configuration on the PepLink Balance 508 was successfully adjusted, allowing the connected Balance 305 devices to traverse to Azure through the established IP Sec VPN tunnels. This indicates that proper routing and policy settings are essential for enabling connectivity between satellite sites and Azure.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo enhance security on Peplink Balance one routers, it is recommended to change the default inbound firewall rule to deny all. If there is a need for specific inbound access, allow rules can be created above the default deny rule.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Peplink Balance B1 does not have an integrated DSL modem, meaning a separate modem is required to connect a DSL line to the Balance device.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe Peplink Balance 300, which is approximately 15 years old, supports a maximum throughput of 20Mbps. Therefore, if clients are experiencing a maximum speed of 15Mbps, this is within the expected performance limits of the device, despite having three WAN connections with a total potential speed of 300Mbps.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 is designed for small office or branch environments and is recommended for up to 60 users. In larger network environments, using a Balance router with a higher capacity is advisable to prevent interruptions. The Balance 20 may struggle with handling traffic loads effectively, especially when multiple clients are connected and NATed by another router.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a throughput rating of 150Mbps, which may become a bottleneck given the total WAN bandwidth of 350/250 Mbps. It excels in load balancing in multi-WAN environments and is recommended to use PepVPN/SpeedFusion instead of IPsec for better performance. For redundancy, it is suggested to use the Balance 20 primarily for NAT, as it may not handle the full bandwidth effectively. A configuration option includes using the cable modem on WAN 1 in drop-in mode and connecting the fiber to WAN 2, allowing the Balance to act as an ARP proxy for failover. This setup would provide public IP access from the cable modem while maintaining backup capabilities with the fiber connection.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, which means that even with three WAN ports activated, the total throughput cannot exceed this limit. To achieve higher throughput with multiple WAN connections, a Peplink Balance One with an extra WAN license would be necessary.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe latest firmware for the Peplink Balance 20W is v4.8.1, and this model has been obsoleted. Users are advised to consider refreshing their router for updated features and support.\n\n## Document_19\n\nTo upgrade the firmware on a Peplink Balance 700 from version 4, the device must first be updated to version 4.8.2, then to 5.3.12, and finally to the highest version 5.4.9. Users are advised to open a support ticket for specific links and instructions regarding the firmware upgrade process.\n\n## Document_20\n\nPeplink lists several USB modems from AT&T that are compatible with their Balance Routers, including models such as the AT&T Mobile Hotspot Elevate 4G, MiFi Liberate, and various Sierra Wireless and LG devices. However, the original post questions the compatibility of newer AT&T products like the AT&T Beam, Unite Pro, Unite, and Velocity with Peplink devices. It is suggested that compatibility may depend on the availability of drivers for these newer dongles.\n\n## Document_21\n\nThe Peplink Balance e30 is not a DSL modem and does not have RJ11 ports; it only features RJ45 Ethernet ports. To connect the Balance router to an ADSL connection, a separate DSL modem is required that provides an Ethernet output to connect to the Balance's WAN port.\n\n## Document_22\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a router throughput rating of 100 Mbps, which is a limiting factor for the maximum speed experienced when connected through the device. The Balance 20 features 4 Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) LAN ports, but the overall throughput is determined by the router's specifications. Users should consider the total throughput by adding the upload and download speeds of all WAN connections to understand performance limitations.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 device has a maximum throughput rating of 20Mbps, which may limit speeds when connected to a higher-speed internet service. The newer model of the Balance 20, which features a metal enclosure, is rated for up to 100Mbps throughput, indicating that upgrading to this newer model could resolve speed limitations experienced with the older version.\n\n## Document_24\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 is capable of handling internet speeds up to 100Mbps, making it suitable for home or small office use. It is recommended as a newer model to replace the older Balance Plus unit, which may not support faster internet speeds.\n\n## Document_25\n\nThe Surf SOHO does not support Band Steering, a feature that is available on Peplink Balance models 20, 30, and above. This means that devices connected to the Surf SOHO will join either the 2.4GHz or 5GHz band arbitrarily, which can lead to suboptimal performance, especially when trying to manage devices that require different frequency bands.\n\n## Document_26\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20X (B20X) is rated for a maximum throughput of 60Mbps when using SpeedFusion VPN with encryption. The performance may be significantly lower when using OpenVPN, which could explain the clients' inability to achieve speeds over 20Mbps on a 1Gbps fiber connection.\n\n## Document_27\n\nThe throughput speed of the Peplink Balance 20 is dependent on the hardware revision and the firmware version. The current model supports a throughput of 150 Mbps when on the latest firmware.\n\n## Document_28\n\nThe throughput speed of the Peplink Balance 20 can be either 100 Mbps or 150 Mbps, which may depend on the specific hardware version or firmware. The R6 model is expected to achieve the higher throughput of 150 Mbps.\n\n## Document_29\n\nTo direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on the Peplink Balance 20/30 series, outbound policy can be utilized to control which server or type of traffic exits through which link. This ensures that return traffic comes back on the same link it was sent out on, maintaining the integrity of sessions such as FTP. If an FTP session is established on WAN1, Peplink will consistently route that FTP traffic through WAN1.\n\n## Document_30\n\nTo direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on a Peplink Balance 20/30 series router, an outbound policy rule can be created. This allows for the configuration of traffic routing, ensuring that certain types of traffic, such as FTP, are directed through a designated WAN connection without round-robin switching between multiple WANs.\n\n## Document_31\n\nThe Balance 20/30 series allows for the configuration of outbound policy rules to direct specific traffic through designated WAN connections. The default outbound policy rule, set to 'Auto', utilizes a weighted balance algorithm based on the downstream bandwidth of each WAN. Users can customize this setting by changing it to 'Custom' to create specific rules for directing traffic, ensuring that certain machines, such as a server for FTP traffic, can be configured to use only a designated WAN connection without round-robin distribution between multiple WANs.\n\n## Document_32\n\nThe Balance 20 and 30 routers have the same technical specifications, with the primary difference being that the Balance 30 includes an additional WAN port. The Balance 210 offers advantages such as support for a greater number of users, a more extensive list of Outbound Load Balancing options (7 options compared to 5 on the 20/30), and increased VPN capabilities not available on the 20 or 30 models. All models support multi-WAN configurations and can accommodate various internet connections including cable, DSL, and 3G/4G.\n\n## Document_33\n\nBoth the Peplink Balance 20 and Balance 30 can be configured for 2 Ethernet connections, while the Balance 30 supports 3 Ethernet connections. Additionally, both models allow for 1 USB 3G/4G connection, which can be set up for backup use through Outbound Policy or WAN status. Users can also implement a bandwidth cap on the USB/Mobile connection to disable it upon reaching a monthly data allowance.\n\n## Document_34\n\nIn a network configuration involving PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is noted that IP Sec tunnels do not typically advertise their routes through second hops. To enable connectivity from satellite sites to Azure, a static route for the Azure subnet can be added on the satellite devices, pointing to the Balance 508. Additionally, firewall configurations on both the satellite sites and Azure may need to be reviewed to ensure they allow the necessary traffic exchange.\n\n## Document_35\n\nTo enable connectivity from PepLink Balance 305 devices to Azure through a Balance 508, static routes can be configured on the Balance 305 for the Azure subnet, using the Balance 508 as the gateway. Additionally, the Azure configuration should include a static route for the Balance 305 subnet, also using the Balance 508 as the gateway. It is important to ensure that firewall rules on both ends permit this routing to function correctly.\n\n## Document_36\n\nIn a network setup involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via a star topology, issues may arise with route advertisement to Azure through IP Sec VPN tunnels. The Balance 508 may not be advertising its routes to the connected Balance 305 devices, which can prevent satellite sites from accessing Azure. Additionally, static routes may need to connect to gateways within the same subnet, which can complicate configurations if sites are not willing to share a common subnet.\n\n## Document_37\n\nTo enhance security on Peplink Balance One routers, it is essential to define firewall rules based on the specific applications in use and their required ports. Common ports for email applications include SMTP, SMTPS, POP, POPS, and IMAPS. It is recommended to obtain information from application vendors to ensure that the appropriate service ports are allowed in the firewall configuration.\n\n## Document_38\n\nTo enhance security on Peplink Balance routers, it is essential to understand the services used in the specific environment before configuring firewall rules. Only the necessary ports should be opened in the Inbound and Outbound firewall rules based on the services being utilized, rather than relying on generic lists of ports.\n\n## Document_39\n\nFor increasing security on Peplink Balance routers, it is recommended to refer to the Peplink Knowledgebase for detailed guidance on configuring firewall rules. The Knowledgebase contains more in-depth information than the manual, including proper setup for firewall rules.\n\n",

Additionally, both models allow for 1 USB 3G/4G connection, which can be set up for backup use through Outbound Policy or WAN status. Users can also implement a bandwidth cap on the USB/Mobile connection to disable it upon reaching a monthly data allowance.",
      "In a network configuration involving PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is noted that IP Sec tunnels do not typically advertise their routes through second hops. To enable connectivity from satellite sites to Azure, a static route for the Azure subnet can be added on the satellite devices, pointing to the Balance 508. Additionally, firewall configurations on both the satellite sites and Azure may need to be reviewed to ensure they allow the necessary traffic exchange.",
      "To enable connectivity from PepLink Balance 305 devices to Azure through a Balance 508, static routes can be configured on the Balance 305 for the Azure subnet, using the Balance 508 as the gateway. Additionally, the Azure configuration should include a static route for the Balance 305 subnet, also using the Balance 508 as the gateway. It is important to ensure that firewall rules on both ends permit this routing to function correctly.",
      "In a network setup involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via a star topology, issues may arise with route advertisement to Azure through IP Sec VPN tunnels. The Balance 508 may not be advertising its routes to the connected Balance 305 devices, which can prevent satellite sites from accessing Azure. Additionally, static routes may need to connect to gateways within the same subnet, which can complicate configurations if sites are not willing to share a common subnet.",
      "To enhance security on Peplink Balance One routers, it is essential to define firewall rules based on the specific applications in use and their required ports. Common ports for email applications include SMTP, SMTPS, POP, POPS, and IMAPS. It is recommended to obtain information from application vendors to ensure that the appropriate service ports are allowed in the firewall configuration.",
      "To enhance security on Peplink Balance routers, it is essential to understand the services used in the specific environment before configuring firewall rules. Only the necessary ports should be opened in the Inbound and Outbound firewall rules based on the services being utilized, rather than relying on generic lists of ports.",
      "For increasing security on Peplink Balance routers, it is recommended to refer to the Peplink Knowledgebase for detailed guidance on configuring firewall rules. The Knowledgebase contains more in-depth information than the manual, including proper setup for firewall rules."

    "query": "How can you configure a Peplink Balance 20/30 series router to ensure that FTP traffic from a specific machine always uses a particular WAN connection, and what is the effect of default outbound policy settings on this behavior?",
    "answer": "To ensure that FTP traffic from a specific machine always uses a particular WAN connection on a Peplink Balance 20/30 series router, you should use the outbound policy settings. Navigate to the Network settings and set the outbound policy to 'Managed by Custom Rules' (instead of the default 'Auto'). Retain the default rules 'HTTPS Persistence' and 'Default', then add a new rule to direct FTP traffic from the specific LAN client to the designated WAN. This configuration ensures that FTP sessions are routed consistently through the chosen WAN connection, preventing round-robin switching that could disrupt FTP. The default outbound policy ('Auto') uses a weighted balance algorithm based on the downstream bandwidth of each WAN, which would distribute traffic (including FTP) across multiple WANs, potentially breaking session consistency. After configuring the custom rule, save and apply the changes to activate the policy.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nTo control Peplink MAX BR1 Mini devices for limited internet access while allowing full access to specific custom domains and IP addresses, it is recommended to use group networks instead of creating individual allow rules for each IP. The user has already implemented content blocking set to high, exempted domains from web blocking, enabled DoS prevention, and Intrusion Detection System (IDS), along with creating allow rules for corporate IPs.\n\n## Document_2\n\nTo achieve bandwidth bonding using multiple SIM cards with a SIM Injector, the router must support multiple active SIM cards. The Peplink MAX BR1 only supports a single active SIM card, while models like the HD2 MBX support two active SIM cards, and the HD4 MBX supports four active SIM cards. Additionally, not all Peplink products are compatible with the SIM Injector.\n\n## Document_3\n\nFor a MAX-HD4-LTEA-W-T installed on a boat for worldwide travel, it is advised to consult with a knowledgeable Peplink supplier regarding compatibility and performance issues, especially since modem requirements can differ between Asia/Pacific and Europe/Americas. The HD4 model does not support modem upgrades, which may limit its effectiveness for global use. Alternatives such as the HD4 MBX, HD2 MBX, or BPL-SDX are recommended, as they allow for future upgrades of cellular modules. Specifications for the next generation Cat 18 modules in Hong Kong and Asia are currently unavailable.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe MAX-HD4-LTEA-W-T (CAT6) is designed for worldwide use, but it does not include compatibility for Asia/Pacific regions. For those areas, the Asia Pacific model MAX-HD4-LTEA-P-T is available. Alternatively, the HD4 MBX offers truly worldwide versions, such as the MAX-HD4-MBX-LTEA-K-T (CAT12) and MAX-HD4-MBX-GLTE-G-T (CAT18), with higher CAT numbers indicating more recent modem versions and faster data transfer rates.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe device is compatible with both AT&T and Verizon networks, requiring only a SIM card and a data plan for operation.\n\n## Document_6\n\nFor the MAX BR1 Mini, it is recommended to look for a local Peplink partner to find suitable low profile external antennas for extending Cellular, Cellular Aux, GPS, and WiFi signals. Peplink provides a list of certified partners for assistance in locating these antennas.\n\n## Document_7\n\nFor installing a MAX BR1 Mini in a truck, a low profile external antenna that extends Cellular, Cellular Aux, GPS, and WiFi can be sourced from various suppliers. The Telco Antennas site from Australia is recommended as a good resource for mobile broadband antennas, even for users outside of Australia.\n\n## Document_8\n\nFor users considering Peplink products, the Max BR2 is a newly announced model that features dual radio 5G capabilities. When running cellular antenna cables over long distances, such as 100 feet, it is advisable to use LMR400 cable for shorter runs of 25-50 feet to minimize signal loss. The choice of MIMO antennas depends on the specific application, and Peplink offers various options in collaboration with Poynting. Additionally, users should consider the power requirements for any switches they plan to use, as this information is crucial for selecting appropriate equipment.\n\n## Document_9\n\nFor inserting the SIM card in the Peplink 310X model, a video guide is available that demonstrates the process, which is similar to that of the BR1 Mini model. An image is also provided to show the specific location for the SIM card in the 310X.\n\n## Document_10\n\nFor improved cellular reception in remote areas using a Pepwave MAX BR1 MK2 LTEA Industrial Grade 4G Cellular Router, it is advisable to replace the original cellular antennas with high-quality external MIMO antennas. Users can request an Antenna Selection Guide from local authorized Peplink Partners to find suitable antenna options for their specific needs.\n\n## Document_11\n\nTo improve cellular signal reception with a Peplink Max BR1 Mini, it is recommended to use two antennas, one optimized for 700 MHz (Band 12) and another for 1900 MHz (Band 2), positioned 3 feet apart with a 90-degree orientation (one horizontal and one vertical). The user identified the connected cell tower using PepWave tools and confirmed the bands available. The current signal strength is affected by terrain, including trees and hills, which may hinder performance. The user plans to verify signal strength by climbing a hill to assess if the terrain allows for better connectivity to a further tower.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo enhance signal strength for a Pepwave MAX BR1 Cat6 in a rural area with two towers 4-5 miles away, using directional antennas aimed at the towers is recommended, particularly if there is a clear line of sight. Brands like Wilson or Poynting are suggested for antenna options. Additionally, for lightning protection, proper grounding and protection measures should be implemented, and using shorter runs of LMR-400 cable is advised, which may require relocating the Pepwave unit to an attic or outdoor enclosure. Regarding prepaid versus postpaid plans with the Pepwave MAX BR1, there are no specific concerns mentioned, and the device can manage dual SIM cards to control data usage, allowing the secondary SIM to take over once the first SIM reaches its data cap.\n\n## Document_13\n\nFor improving cellular signal strength with a Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini in a rural area, directional antennas are recommended as they focus on a specific direction, providing longer range and better reception when aimed correctly at the cellular tower. It is important to regularly verify the connection to the correct tower due to potential changes in tower status. Omnidirectional antennas may be more suitable if multiple towers are nearby, allowing for automatic switching between towers. Poynting antennas are noted as a good option for use with Pepwave routers.\n\n## Document_14\n\nFor optimal performance with the Pepwave MAX BR1 LTE, it is important to consider the signal gain of the antennas used. The BR1 can be monitored for signal levels through InControl2 or locally, which provides historical data. An LTE-A chipset is recommended for better performance at lower and newer radio bands, especially in maritime environments. Antenna systems for MIMO applications should ideally have antennas arranged out of phase (+/- 45 degrees from vertical) to enhance performance. The cabling used must be 50 Ohm impedance, as opposed to 75 Ohm, which is typically used for terrestrial TV. The quality of both the antennas and the cabling significantly impacts performance, and consulting with a local Authorized Peplink Partner is advised for specialized assistance and to access the Antenna Selection Guide.\n\n## Document_15\n\nFor optimal performance with a Max BR1 cellular router, it is important to select an antenna system that supports MIMO (Multi In, Multi Out) technology, ideally with an out of phase antenna array at +/- 45 degrees from vertical. The cabling used should have a 50 Ohm impedance, as opposed to the 75 Ohm used in terrestrial TV systems, to ensure compatibility and performance. The quality of both the antenna and the cabling significantly impacts the overall system performance, especially over long cable runs. Consulting with a local Authorized Peplink Partner can provide specialized assistance and access to an Antenna Selection Guide tailored for Peplink products.\n\n## Document_16\n\nFor improving cellular reception in an urban area with multiple providers, an omnidirectional MIMO antenna with two connectors is recommended for the Pepwave Max BR1. The Poynting antenna is noted as a cost-efficient option. However, a 110-foot cable run is considered too long, which can negatively impact signal quality. It is suggested to use a shorter cable run by placing the Pepwave device in a weather-tight enclosure closer to the antenna and then using CAT6 cable for the remaining distance to connect to an indoor access point or router.\n\n## Document_17\n\nFor improving cellular signal with a Peplink MAX BR1 installed in a basement, it is recommended to minimize the length of the antenna cable run, ideally moving the device closer to the antenna. Using loss calculators and data sheets can help assess cable loss over distance and frequency. A Wilson outdoor omni antenna is suggested, but the choice of antenna should depend on the location of local cellular towers, with directional antennas being a potential option. Considerations for lightning suppression and the use of MIMO antennas, such as those from Poynting, should also be taken into account. Cables can be sourced from suppliers like mpddigital.us.\n\n## Document_18\n\nFor installing a Pepwave MAX BR1 Mk2 in an RV, it is recommended to use MIMO antennas that are compatible with the device, specifically those that operate at 50 ohms and use SMA connectors. Additionally, for amplification, M2M amplifiers like the Wilson (weboost) signal 4G, which provides 15dB of inline amplification, can be used, with one amplifier needed for each antenna wire. Consulting with a local Peplink Partner can provide guidance on sourcing suitable antennas.\n\n## Document_19\n\nFor the MAX BR1, it is important to use a 50 Ohm impedance coaxial cable, as 75 Ohm cables are not suitable for cellular applications. The quality of the coaxial cable can significantly impact performance, and runs of over 50 meters can yield excellent results if designed properly. Antenna systems for MIMO applications work best with an out-of-phase antenna array, typically at +/- 45 degrees from vertical. It is recommended to consult with a local Authorized Peplink Partner for specialized assistance and to obtain an Antenna Selection Guide for optimal antenna solutions.\n\n## Document_20\n\nTo improve cellular signal with a Pepwave MAX-BR1-AE-T, consider replacing the supplied antenna with a higher quality antenna and positioning it for better signal reception. It's important to establish the location of the nearest cellular towers and use low loss coaxial cable for connections, keeping the cable run as short as possible. In cases of poor cellular coverage, high-gain directional antennas may be necessary, ideally mounted at height and directed towards the cellular tower. Relocating the device closer to a window or external wall can also enhance signal reception.\n\n## Document_21\n\nThe Pepwave Max BR1 Mini utilizes a Mini sized 2FF SIM card form factor.\n\n## Document_22\n\nFor improved cellular signal reception on a Pepwave MAX BR1 mini LTE, it is suggested to consider using omni-directional external antennas, as the device's built-in antennas may not be sufficient for optimal performance. The device features SMA fittings for antenna connections. The user's current cellular service with OTRmobile on the T-Mobile network may not be adequate for their needs, and exploring alternative data plans or equipment, such as a Pepwave Max Transit LTEA Cat 18, which has shown better performance with AT&T, could be beneficial.\n\n## Document_23\n\nBy default, there is no VPN enabled on a Peplink router. To troubleshoot issues with VPN access when using a Pepwave Max BRQ mini, it is suggested to reset the router, connect a laptop to the LAN port, log into the router, enter the SIM card PIN, and insert the SIM card.\n\n## Document_24\n\nFor improving cellular reception in challenging environments with a MAX BR1 Mini 5G, a four-element antenna such as the Peplink Mobility 40g or a Parsec Husky is recommended, as the Mobility 82g is not suitable due to its size and excessive cellular elements for this installation. If considering a larger model like the BR2 Pro 5G, the Mobility 82g would be appropriate. Additionally, it is important to keep antenna cables as short as possible to minimize signal loss.\n\n## Document_25\n\nThe Puma 221 is an omnidirectional 5-in-1 antenna designed for mobile applications, providing up to 7 dB gain across various cellular and Wi-Fi frequencies. It connects to two cellular and two Wi-Fi connections (with one being unused on single-band routers like the BR1, which operates only on the 2.4 GHz band). The antenna also includes a GPS connection. The BR1 Mini router is priced at $399, with an additional $100 for a failover license that enables Wi-Fi connectivity to local networks. The Puma 221 antenna costs $199, while the directional X-Pole antenna is priced at $196.14. Extension cables are available for additional costs, typically ranging from $90 to over $100, depending on length.\n\n## Document_26\n\nThe MAX-HD4-LTEA-W-T can be used globally, including in Europe, the USA, Hong Kong, and the South Pacific. For optimal performance, the Poynting 402 antennas are recommended, but careful consideration should be given to the antenna location relative to the Peplink router and the length of the antenna cable runs, as these factors can significantly impact performance.\n\n## Document_27\n\nWhen using a Pepwave MAX-HD4-LTEA-W-T on a boat for world travel, it is important to consider that while the device may work in regions like Europe, the USA, Hong Kong, and the South Pacific, there are no guarantees regarding cellular coverage and potential legal issues with boosters in different countries. For better coverage, especially on a sailing yacht, it is recommended to use dome variants like the HD2 Dome mounted on the mast to minimize cable losses, although this option limits future modem upgrades as the entire dome would need to be replaced instead of just the modem.\n\n## Document_28\n\nThe Balance 310 5G has only one 5G radio, and it is unclear if any Balance units have dual 5G radios. For long cable runs of approximately 100 feet to minimize signal loss when connecting cell antennas, it is recommended to use low-loss coaxial cable. Specific MIMO antennas suitable for the Balance 310 5G were not mentioned. Additionally, for a setup requiring 24 ports on a separate VLAN with Power over Ethernet (PoE) for at least 16 ports, a managed switch that meets these specifications is needed, but no specific model was provided.\n\n## Document_29\n\nFor a setup requiring dual 5G radios, the professional range of Pepwave routers with Cat18 and above modems, such as the MBX HD2 5G and MAX BR2 Pro, offer multiple antenna connections, with the MBX HD4 5G having sixteen connections. When running cell antennas over a distance of over 100 feet, it is recommended to use high-performance cables like Heliax to minimize signal loss, along with suitably matched antennas and RF components with surge protection.

    "documents_text": "## Document_4\n\nFor improved cellular reception with the Pepwave MAX BR1 MK2, it is necessary to connect an antenna to the MAIN port, while an additional antenna can be connected to the AUX port for optional use. For redundancy between antennas, it is recommended to use Pepwave Multi Cellular modem models, such as the Pepwave MAX HD2 and above, which allow for automated connection management within the Pepwave firmware, providing a more reliable solution than manual antenna switching.\n\n## Document_5\n\nFor the installation of Pepwave Max HD2 Mini with external antennas, it is recommended to space the antennas as far apart as possible while keeping coax cable runs under 5 meters. If longer runs are necessary, using LMR 400 coax is advised to minimize signal loss. Proper grounding and alignment are also important considerations for optimal performance.\n\n## Document_6\n\nWhen setting up RF networks, especially with the Pepwave MAX HD4, it is crucial to consider various factors such as location, frequencies, cabling, antennas, power levels, and interferences. It is recommended to use a separate wired antenna for each modem connection, with the HD4 supporting up to eight connections (or 4 x MIMO antennas). Custom solutions may require significant investment, including high-quality hybrid couplers and other components, which can be costly. Consulting with a local Peplink Partner or experienced RF engineer is advised for tailored solutions, as they can provide valuable expertise and support.\n\n## Document_7\n\nTo install SIM cards in the Pepwave MAX HD2 LTEAIP67, it is necessary to open the case. This action will not void the warranty of the device.\n\n## Document_8\n\nWhen mounting multiple antennas for a Peplink MAX HD4 Router, it is important to select the correct antennas, cabling, and RF couplers/splitters. It is possible to use four modems with single MIMO antennas, requiring only two cables to the outside. Key considerations include the distance to local towers, frequencies of local carriers, signal levels at the antenna location, cable pathways, and protection against lightning and electrical surges. Proper installation of lightning and surge protection is crucial to avoid potential damages and insurance issues. Engaging with a local Peplink Partner for specialized assistance and utilizing an Antenna Selection Guide is recommended to ensure the best antenna solution is implemented.\n\n## Document_9\n\nSpare parts such as sim card covers and screws for the Pepwave MAX-TST-DUO device can be purchased separately from suppliers like 5gstore.\n\n## Document_10\n\nFor the MAX BR1 Mini, it is recommended to look for a local Peplink partner to find suitable low profile external antennas for extending Cellular, Cellular Aux, GPS, and WiFi signals. Peplink provides a list of certified partners for assistance in locating these antennas.\n\n## Document_11\n\nFor installing a MAX BR1 Mini in a truck, a low profile external antenna that extends Cellular, Cellular Aux, GPS, and WiFi can be sourced from various suppliers. The Telco Antennas site from Australia is recommended as a good resource for mobile broadband antennas, even for users outside of Australia.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo change the NAT type from 'Strict' to 'Open' for online gaming on an Xbox using a Pepwave MK2, it may be necessary to subscribe to a static public IP if the cellular plan offers this option. Port forwarding alone may not be sufficient to achieve the desired NAT type.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Pepwave MAX HD2 LTE is fully licensed for SpeedFusion VPN, requiring no additional license key for access. To utilize PepVPN, a bonded tunnel must be created from the HD2 to another Peplink appliance or through Peplink's hosted SpeedFusion Cloud service. Alternatively, users can host their own FusionHub appliance in the cloud, which requires licensing based on the number of remote connected devices, such as a 200 peer license for 200 delivery vehicles.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe MAX BR1 Mini features two cellular antenna ports: one for CELLULAR MAIN and another for CELLULAR DIVERSITY/AUX. It is recommended to connect antennas to both ports to take advantage of diversity receive, which can significantly improve performance. Using effective antennas, such as those from the Peplink 'mobility' series, is advisable, especially when extending antennas for better signal reception.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe MAX BR1 Mini utilizes a diversity mode for its antennas, where the second diversity antenna is intended to enhance signal reception by positioning the antennas at a distance apart that is a fraction of the wavelength. The device features two SMA plugs labeled Cellular Main and Cellular Diversity/Aux, indicating the configuration for antenna connections, but specific orientation recommendations for the antennas are not provided in the conversation.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo resolve the 'weak security' message on Apple devices when connecting to a Pepwave Max Duo, the SSID security settings should be edited to change the security policy from WPA2 to WPA3 for improved authentication.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe cellular modules used by Peplink/Pepwave products, including the MAX HD1, are MIMO (Multi In, Multi Out), which require matching antennas on both connections to achieve optimal performance. The Wi-Fi modules can vary, with some having a single antenna connection while most have at least two. To benefit from MIMO and diversity, it is crucial to connect the model with appropriate matching antennas. A local Peplink partner can provide an antenna selection guide for suitable antenna choices.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe functionality of the Pepwave MAX BR1 LTEA IP67 is the same as for other BR1 models, with the primary difference being the casing. A comprehensive manual specifically for the BR1 IP67 will be added to the Pepwave MAX User Manual in the coming weeks.\n\n## Document_19\n\nFor a stable internet connection in South Korea for P2P live videostreaming, it is recommended to use a Pepwave MAX-HD2-Mini-LTE-E-T, MAX-HD2-LTE-E-T, or MAX-HD4-LTE-E-T, as the MAX-On-The-Go and MAX-BR1-LTE-E-T do not support bandwidth bonding. Utilizing Peplink's SpeedFusion VPN with the existing Balance 310 can significantly improve the chances of achieving the required stable speed of 12 MBits for several hours of transmission.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe Pepwave Max BR1 Mini comes with four antennas: one flat antenna connects to the Cellular Main port, another flat antenna connects to the Cellular Diversity/Aux port, and the taller antenna connects to the Wi-Fi connector.\n\n## Document_21\n\nFor creating a VPN connection using a Pepwave Max HD2 E236, SpeedFusion VPN technology is recommended, which requires a compatible device on the non-vehicle or station side. This approach may help improve the performance issues experienced with the previous Cisco 5505 ASA setup, which was bottlenecking the connection.\n\n## Document_22\n\nTo bond multiple SIMs together in a Pepwave MAX-HD2 or MAX-HD4 for a single fast connection, a SpeedFusion Bonding license is required. However, the HD series devices come with the SpeedFusion Bonding license included. Product comparison pages provide information on which SpeedFusion features are supported natively and which require additional licensing or subscriptions.\n\n## Document_23\n\nSpeedFusion Cloud connections are unencrypted by default to maximize throughput, as enabling encryption requires additional hardware resources. This may explain why the InControl interface indicates that the link is insecure, especially if no devices have been connected yet.\n\n## Document_24\n\nTo successfully bond two SIM cards using a Pepwave MAX Transit Duo, it is essential to have a valid SpeedFusion license (MAX-TST-DUO-LC-SF) installed. Without this license, the VPN connection will only utilize one of the cellular radios, preventing effective bonding and resulting in speed tests reflecting only the performance of a single SIM card.\n\n## Document_25\n\nThe footer stating \"Powered by Peplink\" in the Captive Portal login page cannot be removed or changed during customization.\n\n## Document_26\n\nFor improving cellular reception in challenging environments with a MAX BR1 Mini 5G, a four-element antenna such as the Peplink Mobility 40g or a Parsec Husky is recommended, as the Mobility 82g is not suitable due to its size and excessive cellular elements for this installation. If considering a larger model like the BR2 Pro 5G, the Mobility 82g would be appropriate. Additionally, it is important to keep antenna cables as short as possible to minimize signal loss.\n\n## Document_27\n\nFor the MAX BR1 MK2, it is important to connect both the MAIN and AUX antenna connections to improve reception, especially with LTE-A / CAT6 modems that utilize the second antenna for transmit and receive on its own frequencies. A good quality MIMO cellular antenna is recommended for optimal performance. Manual antenna switching can be achieved using a solid state relay, which allows the operator to apply a voltage to select between connected antennas, and such devices can be found at ham radio stores.\n\n## Document_28\n\nWhen installing Pepwave Max HD2 Mini with external antennas, the spacing between antennas should be determined based on their design and frequency. For fixed installations, consider the provider's towers and angles, while for mobile installations, serviceability and flexibility are key. Using high-quality antennas, proper surge protection, suitable connectors with good PIM ratings, and low-loss cabling like Heliax is recommended. For setups with multiple modems, hybrid couplers can reduce the number of required cable runs, which is essential for both mobile and fixed installations. It is advised to avoid mobile boosters or repeaters with LTE modems, and users should consult the Antenna Selection Guide available through local Peplink Partners for optimal antenna solutions.\n\n## Document_29\n\nIn testing an HD4 router with two 4 into 1 splitters, it was found that when the main antenna is disconnected, the auxiliary antenna does not provide a backup connection, resulting in a loss of connection and the SIM card entering a disconnected state while searching for a provider. This behavior was consistent across both cellular slots, and the device is running the latest firmware with overall good performance otherwise.\n\n## Document_30\n\nWhen connecting multiple modems to a shared antenna, it is advised to use a hybrid coupler instead of an RF signal splitter. A splitter can cause increased noise and expose receiving modems to excessive power levels, while a hybrid coupler minimizes loss and does not pass RF power between devices. For optimal performance, MIMO antenna systems work best with an out of phase antenna array, and it is recommended to consult a local Authorized Peplink Partner for specialized assistance and to access the Antenna Selection Guide for Peplink Partners, which provides detailed guidance on suitable antenna solutions.\n\n## Document_31\n\nMarine antennas typically have high gain (6-9dBi) to maximize offshore range, and the selection of an appropriate antenna depends on the type of vessel and the distance from shore. Higher gain antennas can extend range beyond 120km offshore, but they have a narrower reception angle, which may not be suitable for smaller vessels that sway. Recommended antennas include the RFI CDQ7199, ZCG ZM21-4GX, and ZCG SGDB-SS-S, each with specific frequency ranges and gain specifications.\n\n## Document_32\n\nFor optimal performance in a cellular RF network, high-quality MIMO omni antennas are recommended, although they can be expensive and bulky, making them potentially unsuitable for small installations like boats. Professional RF engineers can design tailored solutions for setups like the EPX, but this service may incur significant costs. Users seeking assistance with antenna selection or RF network design should contact Peplink Sales for guidance and potential connections to experienced engineers. Additional resources for MIMO antennas can be found on websites like Telco Antennas and CommScope.\n\n## Document_33\n\nIn setups where space is limited, such as on private yachts, it may not be feasible to use one antenna for each modem port. Alternatives like 4-way dividers/combiners or gain control amplifiers can be considered, although hybrid couplers, which typically have 4 ports and isolate signals without direct contact, may also be used. The efficiency of hybrid couplers compared to resistive isolation power dividers is a point of discussion, particularly regarding insertion loss and isolation specifications.\n\n## Document_34\n\nFor enhancing the performance of MAX HD4 Routers, it is suggested to consider using MIMO antennas instead of separate antennas. Poynting offers options that would allow the use of 4 antennas instead of 8, which could simplify the setup. Alternatively, coupling or splitting over a single MIMO antenna is another approach, though the disadvantages of this method are not specified.\n\n## Document_35\n\nIf spare parts such as SIM card covers for the MAX-TST-DUO device are needed, they are not listed as standard spare parts. However, local Peplink Partners can assist in sourcing these parts by working directly with Peplink.\n\n## Document_36\n\nTo change the NAT type from 'Strict' to 'Open' on an Xbox using a Pepwave MK2, first check if the public IP seen on ipchicken.com matches the IP on the Peplink dashboard; if they match, you have a public IP. For achieving an open NAT, only port 3074 UDP is required, as previous configurations with multiple port forwarding rules are no longer necessary since a change made in 2017 allows for multiple Xboxes in one household.\n\n## Document_37\n\nThe antennas for the Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini operate in diversity mode for the LTE variant and in MIMO mode for the LTE-A variant. Diversity mode improves signal reception by placing antennas a distance apart, while MIMO allows for parallel transmission on both antennas.\n\n## Document_38\n\nTo resolve the 'weak security' message when connecting to a Pepwave Max Duo via WiFi, it is recommended to use WPA2 or WPA3 security protocols instead of WPA. The warning typically appears when the security setting is downgraded to WPA, which may not be supported by some older devices. For better compatibility and security, using WPA2/WPA3 is advisable.\n\n## Document_39\n\nThe antennas on the Pepwave BR1 MK2 are confirmed to be MIMO, which supports multiple input and multiple output for improved performance. The specification indicates that the device features simultaneous dual-band 802.11ac access point and Wi-Fi WAN capabilities.\n\n",

      "The antennas for the Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini operate in diversity mode for the LTE variant and in MIMO mode for the LTE-A variant. Diversity mode improves signal reception by placing antennas a distance apart, while MIMO allows for parallel transmission on both antennas.",
      "To resolve the 'weak security' message when connecting to a Pepwave Max Duo via WiFi, it is recommended to use WPA2 or WPA3 security protocols instead of WPA. The warning typically appears when the security setting is downgraded to WPA, which may not be supported by some older devices. For better compatibility and security, using WPA2/WPA3 is advisable.",
      "The antennas on the Pepwave BR1 MK2 are confirmed to be MIMO, which supports multiple input and multiple output for improved performance. The specification indicates that the device features simultaneous dual-band 802.11ac access point and Wi-Fi WAN capabilities."

    "query": "What are the best practices and considerations for optimizing antenna setup and performance on Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini and MAX HD series devices, particularly regarding MIMO, diversity, antenna placement, and hybrid couplers?",
    "answer": "For the MAX BR1 Mini, connect both the Cellular Main and Cellular Diversity/Aux antenna ports to take advantage of diversity receive—this significantly improves performance. The LTE variant uses diversity mode (enhancing reception by spacing antennas apart), while the LTE-A variant uses MIMO mode (enabling parallel transmission and reception on both antennas). Use high-quality, low-loss cables and keep cable runs as short as possible to minimize signal loss; if longer runs are unavoidable, use cables like LMR 400. Select antennas matched to your device and application, such as Peplink's mobility series or other four-element MIMO antennas for 5G models.\n\nFor MAX HD series (HD2, HD4, etc.), each modem should have its own wired antenna for optimal performance. The cellular modules are MIMO, so matching antennas on all connections is critical. For installations where running many cables is impractical, hybrid couplers can be used to allow multiple modems to share antennas with less signal loss and better isolation than RF splitters. Avoid using splitters, as they increase noise and can expose modems to excessive power. Proper spacing and alignment of antennas, good grounding, and surge protection are also essential, especially in fixed or marine installations. Consulting with a Peplink Partner or RF engineer and using the Antenna Selection Guide is strongly advised for custom or complex setups.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nThe firmware version 3.6 does not include the WDS option in the AP tab, as noted in the release notes for that specific version. Users should be aware of this limitation when skipping firmware versions during updates.\n\n## Document_2\n\nTo utilize Peplink's FusionHub service for line bonding, a SpeedFusion capable router (model 210 or higher) is required at home, along with the FusionHub software installed on a cloud service such as AWS, GCE, or Azure. The FusionHub service is available to both private and business users, and FusionHub Solo can be used for single device deployments, providing one free SpeedFusion peer.\n\n## Document_3\n\nFor bonded internet access using Peplink products, the SpeedFusion hub virtual appliance can be utilized to run on servers, allowing for a tunnel connection without needing to connect to another router. This option is available through Peplink's FusionHub product.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Max HotSpot supports Virtual WAN (VWAN) as it is compatible with firmware version 8.3, which includes this feature.\n\n## Document_5\n\nIn firmware version 7.0 for the Balance 2500 and 380, the option to specify VLANs to a specific LAN port is not visible, unlike in the Balance 310 where options for trunking and custom VLAN settings are available. The Custom trunk feature that allows both tagged and untagged traffic was removed in version 7.01 for the Balance 30, indicating a differentiation in feature sets among the Balance series routers based on model rather than just the number of WAN and LAN connections.\n\n## Document_6\n\nWhen configuring a LAN as WAN on a Pepwave device, if it is not functioning while the same configuration works on WAN1, it may be beneficial to try firmware beta 8.4, as it could potentially resolve compatibility or functionality issues.\n\n## Document_7\n\nFor a Balance 20X configured with Virtual WAN on a LAN port, both WAN1 and WAN2 should have static IPs for direct connections. A connection should exist between WAN1 and WAN1 as well as WAN2 and WAN2. If WAN1 is disconnected, the connection between sites fails. Additionally, both WAN1 and WAN2 must have the appropriate VLANs associated, with WAN2 (LAN3) also having a VLAN configured.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20X can utilize a Virtual WAN license to add a third WAN port by converting a LAN port into a WAN port. This allows for the integration of an additional DSL line, such as a 25mbps line used for Bell Fibe TV, into the network setup. There may be compatibility restrictions with certain hardware versions regarding the use of an expansion VDSL module, and consulting a Peplink Partner is recommended for further information.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe BPL-021X-LC-VWAN is a Balance 20X Virtual WAN Activation License that allows for the conversion of LAN ports to WAN ports. Multiple virtual WANs can be implemented on the Balance 20X, with their performance being capped at the maximum LAN port speed to which they are connected. The memory footprint of multiple virtual WANs on the Balance 20X is a consideration, and the number of virtual WANs is limited by the available LAN ports if an L2 switch is not used.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Peplink Balance 380 with hardware revision 5 and firmware version 6.3.4 does not support SpeedFusion or WAN Smoothing, as these features were introduced in firmware version 7.1.1, which is not available for that hardware revision.\n\n## Document_11\n\nIn testing the Balance 30 LTE router, a problem was identified where a hotswap of the SIM card in slot A required a reboot for communication to work, while hotswapping in slot B functioned correctly. The router was running firmware version 6.3.1_3138, and the test involved four SIM cards from different mobile operators. It is suggested to replicate the issue and potentially open a support ticket for further investigation.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe location inaccuracies during internet searches on a MAX BR1 Pro (4G version) are due to the routed IP address, which can be influenced by the mobile network's nearest point of presence. To check the current geolocation of the IP address, a GEO IP lookup can be performed using tools like iplocation.io. For a more consistent location experience while traveling, using SpeedFusion Relay with a device at home can help maintain a stable connection.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe most recent API documentation available for Peplink devices is for firmware version 8.3.0, and there is currently no documentation released for version 8.4.0.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo test Remote SIM functionality on a Pepwave device, it is suggested to use a special firmware version, specifically build 7.1.1s156, as the Remote SIM settings are not available in firmware versions 8 and 7.1.2.\n\n## Document_15\n\nTo configure VLANs on a Pepwave MAX BR1 with firmware version 7.0, navigate to Network > Network Settings and look for the option to create multiple VLANs, which can be accessed by clicking on the blue question mark for guidance. The setup includes VLAN 1 for the main line with backup cellular and VLAN 2 for controllers with SpeedFusion.\n\n## Document_16\n\nFirmware version 6.3.1 is expected to contain a fix for connectivity issues experienced with certain devices on the LAN side of the Pepwave Surf SOHO router after upgrading to firmware 6.3.0, which caused two of the three devices to lose connectivity and not appear on the Status Client List.\n\n## Document_17\n\nFusionHub is a virtual SpeedFusion appliance from Peplink that allows the establishment of SpeedFusion connections between cloud servers and physical Peplink devices, including support for Amazon Web Services (AWS). To deploy FusionHub on AWS, users need to have a basic understanding of SpeedFusion/PepVPN, InControl 2, and the AWS Marketplace, including EC2 and VPC configurations. The deployment process involves selecting an appropriate EC2 instance type, configuring network settings, and ensuring external connectivity by disabling source/destination checks and enabling IP forwarding. Users can test connectivity using built-in tools like PING and the PepVPN Analyzer, and troubleshooting may involve checking security rules and VPC route tables.\n\n## Document_18\n\nFusionHub is Peplink's virtual SpeedFusion appliance that enables the establishment of SpeedFusion connections between cloud servers and physical Peplink units. It supports various Hypervisor Platforms and a growing number of Cloud Platforms, including AWS, MS Azure, Google Cloud, and Digital Ocean. Users should consider the security implications of deploying FusionHub, particularly regarding firewall requirements when using platforms like Vultr, which does not automatically provide a firewall in front of the VM.\n\n## Document_19\n\nTo access remote peers using a Static IP of a server and a WAN admin port, one should use InControl with the Pepmin feature, which is available starting from firmware version 6.1.2, rather than configuring FusionHub for this purpose.\n\n## Document_20\n\nPeplink FusionHub is a virtual appliance that serves as a gateway for SpeedFusion, which is part of Peplink's SD-WAN capabilities.\n\n## Document_21\n\nFusionHub can be successfully deployed in Azure, and there is an unofficial installation guide available for those interested in the process.\n\n## Document_22\n\nFusionHub is a virtual SpeedFusion appliance from Peplink that allows for establishing SpeedFusion connections between cloud servers and physical Peplink devices. It can run on various virtual machine software, including VMware, Citrix XenServer, and Oracle VirtualBox. FusionHub enables bandwidth bonding by combining the speed of multiple WAN links and provides session persistence for a highly available connection. It can be deployed in private, public, and hybrid clouds, integrating datacenters and cloud servers into existing SpeedFusion networks.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20X router supports a virtual WAN (vWAN) activation license that allows users to VLAN tag a LAN port and utilize it as a WAN port, enhancing network flexibility. This feature enables the creation of additional virtual WAN interfaces, allowing for the integration of multiple internet sources, such as Starlink and LTE connections. The vWAN capability is particularly beneficial for extending WAN connectivity over long distances using existing infrastructure. The router requires the latest firmware (version 8.3 or higher) and must be managed through InControl to activate the vWAN feature. The Balance 20X is equipped with a built-in category 7 LTE modem and supports a 5G Flex module, allowing for up to three internet connections. The setup process includes configuring the router's settings and ensuring proper licensing for the vWAN feature to function effectively.\n\n## Document_24\n\nPeplink's FusionHub is a virtual appliance that functions as an alternative to hardware-based SpeedFusion routers and the SpeedFusion Cloud service, allowing users to connect without needing a public IP address, as this can be provided by the cloud service. The FusionHub Solo is a free option limited to one peer-to-peer connection, while paid licenses support multiple connections. Users must set up an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to configure the FusionHub, selecting an instance type such as the T3 medium for optimal performance. The setup involves navigating through AWS to subscribe to the FusionHub service, launching an EC2 instance, and configuring it with a unique local ID and license key. Firmware updates can be performed through the web admin interface or InControl2, and configuration of SpeedFusion can be done via the web admin or InControl2, but not simultaneously.\n\n## Document_25\n\nSpeedFusion technology can be deployed without the cloud by utilizing physical public routers or self-hosted Fusion Hub virtual machines on VMware or Hyper-V infrastructures. Devices such as the Peplink SDX Pro and SpeedFusion Pro 710 can serve as gateways, allowing for complex routing configurations. Fusion Hubs, while lacking some routing capabilities of physical routers, can still integrate with cloud services like AWS Transit Gateway Connect to enhance networking capabilities. The configuration of VPN tunnels can be tailored for specific applications, allowing for hot failover and bandwidth management through settings like link failure detection and WAN connection priorities. This flexibility enables users to optimize their network for different scenarios, ensuring reliable connectivity for applications such as VoIP and data sharing.\n\n## Document_26\n\nIn firmware version 3.6.0, the WDS (Wireless Distribution System) option is not supported. It is recommended to update to firmware version 3.6.1 to access this feature.\n\n## Document_27\n\nTo access the WDS option in the AP tab, users may need to download firmware version 3.5.4 from the Peplink support downloads archive, ensuring that the firmware matches the hardware revision of their access point.\n\n## Document_28\n\nIn firmware version 3.6 of Pepwave AP products, the WDS (Wireless Distribution System) option has been eliminated from the web interface, which has caused issues for users relying on this feature for connectivity in situations without Ethernet cabling. Users have expressed concerns about the lack of communication regarding this change, as the documentation still references the WDS feature, and they advocate for better transparency in release notes regarding feature changes in future firmware updates.\n\n## Document_29\n\nPeplink supports the use of Amazon Web Services (AWS) for bonded internet services, allowing users to connect to a server that creates a tunnel rather than connecting to another router. While AWS is officially supported, other cloud platforms like Google Cloud Servers are not officially supported by Peplink. When choosing a hosting provider, considerations include latency for timing-critical applications and local government regulations regarding data storage and export laws, particularly for organizations in Australia and the US. Users can also seek assistance from Peplink partners for setup and ongoing support.\n\n## Document_30\n\nIn firmware version 7.0 for the Peplink Balance 2500 and 380, the option to specify VLANs to a specific LAN port is not available, which is consistent with the expected behavior.

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nFor users seeking stronger antennas for their Pepwave model, it is noted that most third-party antennas will require some form of mounting. While there are options available such as 'stick on' or magnetic antennas that minimize the need for drilling holes, all alternatives will still involve some level of mounting to ensure proper functionality.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe Balance MediaFast family of products supports 7 load balancing algorithms, while the BALANCE family supports 8. The missing algorithm is likely 'fastest response time', which was added most recently. However, it is also possible that the MediaFast reference and datasheets are outdated.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe MediaFast 500 supports all 8 load balancing algorithms, contrary to the initial impression that it only supports 7. This indicates that the specifications for the MediaFast family may not be fully representative of its capabilities regarding load balancing algorithms.\n\n## Document_4\n\nTo direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on the Peplink Balance 20/30 series, it is important to explore the outbound policy settings rather than inbound rules. The outbound policy allows for the configuration of rules that can route traffic from specific devices or applications to designated WAN connections, ensuring that certain traffic, such as FTP, is consistently routed through the intended WAN without round-robin switching between multiple connections.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThere is no specific DIN mounting bracket available for the AP One Rugged, but users may be able to adapt one of the available mounting options from Peplink's accessory store. Links to various mounting kits and options are provided for further exploration.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Peplink Balance Series does not support TR-069, but users can manage their devices using InControl2, which is Peplink's network management solution.\n\n## Document_7\n\nIf a Peplink Balance X20 router is still registered to a previous owner when setting up InControl2, it may indicate that the original purchaser did not restore the router to factory settings before returning it. Restoring to factory settings is necessary to wipe out the InControl registration. For issues with registration or warranty, contacting Peplink support directly is advisable, as they can provide assistance with account and warranty inquiries.\n\n## Document_8\n\nIf there is packet loss on a Peplink Balance 5G device caused by a physical hardware fault, an RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) can be obtained. Peplink engineering will validate the issue remotely before approving the RMA through the distributor.\n\n## Document_9\n\nIn a network configuration involving PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is noted that IP Sec tunnels do not typically advertise their routes through second hops. To enable connectivity from satellite sites to Azure, a static route for the Azure subnet can be added on the satellite devices, pointing to the Balance 508. Additionally, firewall configurations on both the satellite sites and Azure may need to be reviewed to ensure they allow the necessary traffic exchange.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo enable connectivity from PepLink Balance 305 devices to Azure through a Balance 508, static routes can be configured on the Balance 305 for the Azure subnet, using the Balance 508 as the gateway. Additionally, the Azure configuration should include a static route for the Balance 305 subnet, also using the Balance 508 as the gateway. It is important to ensure that firewall rules on both ends permit this routing to function correctly.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe outbound policy configuration on the PepLink Balance 508 was successfully adjusted, allowing the connected Balance 305 devices to traverse to Azure through the established IP Sec VPN tunnels. This indicates that proper routing and policy settings are essential for enabling connectivity between satellite sites and Azure.\n\n## Document_12\n\nOn the Peplink Balance two, the LAN/WAN light may not illuminate if there is no connectivity or if the link is operating at 10 or 100 Mbps. This behavior is documented in the May 2020 manual for Balance models.\n\n## Document_13\n\nTo enhance security on Peplink Balance one routers, it is recommended to change the default inbound firewall rule to deny all. If there is a need for specific inbound access, allow rules can be created above the default deny rule.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe Peplink Balance 300, which is approximately 15 years old, supports a maximum throughput of 20Mbps. Therefore, if clients are experiencing a maximum speed of 15Mbps, this is within the expected performance limits of the device, despite having three WAN connections with a total potential speed of 300Mbps.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe firmware version 4.1.0 build 1083 on the Peplink Balance 30 classic can be updated to version 4.8.1, and the firmware file can be downloaded from the provided link: https://download.peplink.com/firmware/plb30/fw-b30-4.8.1build1106.bin.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo set up Peplink Balance VPNs for mobile smart devices using public unencrypted WiFi, it is important to configure the L2TP/IPSEC Preshared Key and the User account password correctly. This ensures secure communication over public networks.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe default login credentials for the Peplink Balance 1 router are username 'admin' and password 'admin'.\n\n## Document_18\n\nTo set up a Peplink Balance device, connect the modem to WAN1, which is configured by default to receive a DHCP address. Then, connect a PC to the LAN side and access the device's interface by browsing to 192.168.50.1 to begin configuration and usage.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe WiFi light on a Peplink One Balance indicates the status of traffic flow over the WiFi connection. A blinking green light signifies that there is traffic, while a slowly blinking green or static green light indicates no traffic but that WiFi is enabled. If the WiFi light is off, it means that WiFi is turned off.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe Balance 30-20 does not support reverse proxy functionality. However, inbound load balancing is supported on the Balance 210 and above models.\n\n## Document_21\n\nThe latest firmware for the Peplink Balance 20W is v4.8.1, and this model has been obsoleted. Users are advised to consider refreshing their router for updated features and support.\n\n## Document_22\n\nWhen using a Peplink load balancer to access videos stored in Google Drive, an error occurs when load balancing over two connections, while a single connection works fine. This issue may be related to the firewall configuration, which delivers only one IP address to the load balancer.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe Peplink HD4 currently supports only 2 WAN connections and does not offer a license upgrade to enable additional WAN ports, unlike the Peplink Balancer One which has a license feature for 5 WAN ports.\n\n## Document_24\n\nFor enhancing WAN connectivity in an RV campground wifi setup, a suggested accessory is a dual-band Wi-Fi indoor omni antenna, which can be found on the Peplink store website.\n\n## Document_25\n\nSpeedFusion Connect 5G/LTE plans can be used in both the US and Canada, and they are not locked to a single country. Customers in the US can purchase a plan for use in Canada as well.\n\n## Document_26\n\nTo direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on the Peplink Balance 20/30 series, outbound policy can be utilized to control which server or type of traffic exits through which link. This ensures that return traffic comes back on the same link it was sent out on, maintaining the integrity of sessions such as FTP. If an FTP session is established on WAN1, Peplink will consistently route that FTP traffic through WAN1.\n\n## Document_27\n\nTo direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on a Peplink Balance 20/30 series router, an outbound policy rule can be created. This allows for the configuration of traffic routing, ensuring that certain types of traffic, such as FTP, are directed through a designated WAN connection without round-robin switching between multiple WANs.\n\n## Document_28\n\nTo direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on a Peplink Balance 20/30 series router, navigate to the Network settings and set the Outbound Policy to 'Managed by Custom Rules'. Retain the default rules 'HTTPS Persistence' and 'Default', and then add new rules to enforce traffic from specific LAN clients to designated WANs. After creating the rules, ensure to click 'Save' and then 'Apply Changes' to implement them.\n\n## Document_29\n\nThe Balance 20/30 series allows for the configuration of outbound policy rules to direct specific traffic through designated WAN connections. The default outbound policy rule, set to 'Auto', utilizes a weighted balance algorithm based on the downstream bandwidth of each WAN. Users can customize this setting by changing it to 'Custom' to create specific rules for directing traffic, ensuring that certain machines, such as a server for FTP traffic, can be configured to use only a designated WAN connection without round-robin distribution between multiple WANs.\n\n## Document_30\n\nIf a Peplink Balance X20 router is found to be registered to someone else upon setting up InControl2, it is recommended to return the router for a refund and order a new one from a seller that is shipped and sold by Amazon or an authorized reseller to ensure proper registration and warranty coverage.\n\n## Document_31\n\nPacket loss in a Peplink Balance 5G device can be caused by issues with the WAN connection between SpeedFusion peers, particularly affecting the wired WAN connection while cellular WANs may function properly. To address packet loss, it is recommended to use Dynamic Weighted Bonding, which prevents packets from being sent through unhealthy tunnels, thereby mitigating the impact of packet loss and high latency. Additionally, it is important to ensure that both devices are upgraded to the necessary firmware version to enable this feature.\n\n## Document_32\n\nTo address packet loss issues with a Peplink Balance 5G via WAN link, it is recommended to test the device by connecting it directly to an internet connection to demonstrate any faults. If errors are found on the WAN1 port causing packet loss while WAN2 operates without issues, this could indicate a physical fault with the WAN1 port, which may lead to an RMA approval. However, if both WAN ports are functioning correctly, Peplink will not authorize an RMA for a device deemed non-faulty.\n\n## Document_33\n\nPacket loss on the Peplink Balance 5G may occur when the upload throughput exceeds 30Mbps, particularly with ADSL WAN links, which can exhibit similar behavior when upload capacity is saturated. It is important to conduct tests specifically on the physical WAN port to diagnose the issue accurately.\n\n## Document_34\n\nIn a network setup involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via a star topology, issues may arise with route advertisement to Azure through IP Sec VPN tunnels. The Balance 508 may not be advertising its routes to the connected Balance 305 devices, which can prevent satellite sites from accessing Azure. Additionally, static routes may need to connect to gateways within the same subnet, which can complicate configurations if sites are not willing to share a common subnet.\n\n## Document_35\n\nIn a network configuration involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 routers connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is important to ensure that outbound rules are correctly set up for traffic to traverse from the satellite sites to Azure. The Balance 508 needs to properly advertise its routes to the connected 305 devices for successful end-to-end connectivity.\n\n## Document_36\n\nIn a test installation of the Balance two, if the WAN lines show as connected but the LAN lines do not display as connected despite having connectivity, this may be due to a known issue that has been resolved in firmware version 8.1.0.\n\n## Document_37\n\nIn a test installation of the Balance Two router, the WAN ports show as connected with green indicators, while the LAN ports do not display green despite having connectivity. All LAN port speeds are set to Auto, similar to the WAN ports, which may suggest a configuration issue or a need for further investigation into the LAN settings.\n\n## Document_38\n\nTo enhance security on Peplink Balance One routers, it is essential to define firewall rules based on the specific applications in use and their required ports. Common ports for email applications include SMTP, SMTPS, POP, POPS, and IMAPS. It is recommended to obtain information from application vendors to ensure that the appropriate service ports are allowed in the firewall configuration.\n\n",

    "documents_text": "## Document_2\n\nIntermittent cellular disconnects on a Pepwave MAX BR1 MK2 can be influenced by the health check mechanisms that use the ISP/Telco DNS servers. The device aggressively checks the status of all connected WANs in real-time, which can lead to issues if the DNS servers are unreliable. Switching to alternative DNS servers, such as Google's 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4, may improve the reliability of health checks and reduce the frequency of disconnects.\n\n## Document_3\n\nTo address WAN disconnect issues on a Peplink 20X, it is suggested to change the DNS server from the auto-assigned one received through DHCP on the WAN port to a static DNS server, such as 8.8.8.8 (Google). This DNS address should also be used for health checks to potentially improve connection stability during activities like livestreaming video.\n\n## Document_4\n\nWhen experiencing WAN disconnects with a Peplink Balance 20X, users have reported that changing the DNS settings in the health check configuration may help. Specifically, replacing the default DNS servers with Google's DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) has shown some improvement, although disconnects can still occur. Frequent WAN disconnects can lead to issues such as changing WAN IP addresses, which may require adjustments to firewall settings in cloud configurations.\n\n## Document_5\n\nTo optimize load sharing between two ISPs using a Peplink Balance One, it is important to accurately set the available download and upload bandwidth values in the WAN settings for each connection. Changing both WAN DNS servers to Google DNS (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) can help mitigate issues caused by slow DNS server responses, which may contribute to intermittent stalls. Using the 'fastest response time' algorithm can also improve bandwidth distribution between the two ISPs.\n\n## Document_6\n\nOn a Balance router, there is no straightforward method to view the current routing tables, especially in a complex multi-WAN dynamic outbound policy based routing environment. For WAN health-check issues, if a WAN interface shows as 'Connected' despite no active SIM card, it may be due to the connected device responding to DNS queries. To improve health-check accuracy, it is recommended to change the health-check method to ping a website instead of relying on DNS lookups.\n\n## Document_7\n\nTo mitigate the risk of DNS failure, users can manually set DNS servers on the Peplink Balance One by unchecking the option to obtain DNS servers automatically. It is advisable to use the ISP's DNS server as the primary due to faster response times, while a public DNS server, such as Google's (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4), can serve as a backup. This setup allows for redundancy in case the primary DNS fails, ensuring continued access to services.\n\n## Document_8\n\nTo address connectivity issues with a Peplink Balance One using a Spectrum Cable with Static IP, users have found success by using Google's DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4), adjusting interface speeds, or switching to HTTP health checks. However, persistent issues may indicate a poor quality connection from the ISP, and in such cases, it is advisable to contact the ISP for service support. Disabling the health check can serve as a temporary fix.\n\n## Document_9\n\nFor troubleshooting DNS failures with a Peplink Balance One connected to two Cradlepoint AER 2100 devices using Verizon SIMs, it is recommended to change the health check target back to Google's DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) to accurately monitor internet connectivity. The issue may be related to the Cradlepoint devices rather than the Peplink router, as the problem did not occur with a different router previously used for balancing activities.\n\n## Document_10\n\nIf experiencing a failed DNS test error on a Peplink router after modem replacement, it may be due to unreliable ISP DNS servers. It is recommended to use Google's DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) for Health Check targets, which can be configured on the specific WAN connection to improve reliability.\n\n## Document_11\n\nTo resolve issues accessing HTTPS sites with a Pepwave Balance One, it is recommended to change the healthcheck DNS servers on the MOTG (Mobile On The Go) device to external DNS servers such as 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. This is necessary because the current setup may be causing the Balance One to perform healthchecks against a DNS server that is not functioning correctly, leading to problems with secure connections while non-secure sites remain accessible.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo address issues with Comcast's DNS server timing out and causing the Peplink router to disconnect WAN1, it is recommended to change the DNS servers in the WAN settings to Google's DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) to avoid false warnings. This approach allows the DNS health check to function correctly without disconnecting the WAN unnecessarily.\n\n## Document_13\n\nTo address issues with health check failures on a Peplink Balance 20 when using a Verizon DSL connection, it is suggested to try different DNS servers, such as Google DNS (8.8.8.8), or to set the IP of the first hop or gateway. This may help mitigate problems where the health check is too sensitive and incorrectly identifies the link as down despite successful ping tests from other devices.\n\n## Document_14\n\nWhen experiencing HEALTH CHECK FAILED messages on a Peplink Balance router with a Comcast cable modem, it is advised to avoid using Comcast's DNS servers (75.75.75.75 and 75.75.76.76) due to observed packet loss. Instead, using Google's DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) is recommended. If health check failures persist after switching DNS, it may indicate a problem with the internet line itself.\n\n## Document_15\n\nTo address DNS lookup failures on a Pepwave BR1 MK2, it is recommended to set the WAN DNS servers to Google's public DNS at 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. Additionally, configuring the WAN health check to ping 8.8.8.8 may help improve stability and connectivity issues.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo troubleshoot intermittent internet access issues with a Pepwave MAX-BR1-ENT connected via ATT cellular, it is recommended to use Google DNS servers (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) for better DNS resolution. Additionally, checking the event log for health check failures on the BR1 is advised, and if only ATT is connected, disabling the health check on the cellular connection may help. When the issue occurs, testing connectivity by pinging a website using its IP address and then its DNS name can provide insights into whether the problem is related to DNS resolution.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo address the issue of intermittent \"connected no internet\" status on a Pepwave router running firmware 8.1.2s052, it is suggested to change the WAN DNS settings to use public DNS servers such as Google's (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4). The event log indicates multiple instances of WAN disconnections due to failing the DNS test, which may be resolved by using a more reliable DNS provider.\n\n## Document_18\n\nUsers have reported a known issue with AT&T Unlimited plans where internet connectivity drops intermittently, affecting devices like the Pepwave BR1. Although changing the DNS server settings to Google's DNS (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) temporarily resolves the issue, the problem persists, requiring a modem reboot to restore internet access. This issue is not specific to any particular device or vendor, as similar experiences have been shared across various platforms.\n\n## Document_19\n\nWhen using Pepwave BR1 modems with AT&T Unlimited, users may experience intermittent internet connectivity issues, where web pages fail to load despite being able to ping DNS servers. Changing the DNS settings to Google's servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) may temporarily resolve the issue, but the problem can recur, necessitating a modem reboot. To mitigate these issues, it is suggested to run essential connections through a SpeedFusion tunnel to avoid disruptions caused by AT&T's network management practices.\n\n## Document_20\n\nTo address WAN disconnects on a Peplink Balance 20X, if only one WAN is connected, it is advisable to disable the WAN health check. For multiple WANs, downloading a diagnostic file and logging a support ticket can help identify the root cause of the issue. It is noted that health check results may indicate underlying problems with the ISP network that typical routers might not detect. Additionally, using alternative DNS servers such as Google's (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) for health checks can provide more reliable results.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo address WAN disconnects with a Peplink Balance 20X, it is important to check for any modem or network edge device between the router and the internet connection, as these can contribute to connectivity issues. Peplink routers can capture data on ISP reliability, which can help in proving faults with the ISP. In some cases, replacing the ISP's edge device with a direct connection to the router can resolve issues. Additionally, adding a cellular module to the Balance 20X and using InControl2 for logging ISP connection issues can improve network uptime and reliability, especially during events like livestreaming.\n\n## Document_22\n\nTo troubleshoot WAN disconnects on a Peplink 20X, it is recommended to check and swap Ethernet cables, examine the modem for corrected and uncorrected error counts, and review the Event Log for issues. Peplink routers with firmware 8 offer WAN quality monitoring, which may help in diagnosing the problem. If possible, consider replacing the modem with one that is known to work well with the ISP.\n\n## Document_23\n\nTo address WAN disconnects on a Peplink 20X, using the default gateway as a health check may be more reliable than DNS checks, as repeated DNS requests can trigger security features from ISPs. Disabling the health check entirely could prevent false negatives if no issues are observed from a LAN perspective. Running a constant ping from a LAN device to monitor for drops can help identify connectivity issues. Health check failures may cause the Peplink to stop routing traffic to a WAN even if the link appears fine during manual checks.\n\n## Document_24\n\nTo address WAN disconnects on a Peplink 20X, it is recommended to ping the default gateway for each WAN connection, as it should always respond if the link is established. In scenarios with dynamic IP addresses, a feature that allows using the default gateway as a ping host could improve reliability. In cases where a connection is unstable, such as with a saturated DSL line, removing health checks may prevent unnecessary disconnects, although this may lead to complaints if users experience interruptions. It is advisable to maintain health checks and use priority algorithms if connection reliability is critical for users.\n\n## Document_25\n\nDisabling the integrated Wi-Fi access point on the Peplink 20X resolved stability issues related to WAN disconnects. The user had previously enabled the integrated Wi-Fi to improve signal for a distant device, which inadvertently caused instability in the router's performance. The user is now working on an RMA with their vendor for further assistance.\n\n## Document_26\n\nTo mitigate the risk of DNS failure affecting static IPs, one can consider using multiple DNS providers for redundancy. The Peplink Balance One can perform health checks on DNS hosts configured under Network / WAN settings, but it only alerts for complete DNS failures rather than partial ones. It does not have the capability to serve as a primary or secondary DNS server, nor does it provide notifications for individual DNS host failures. For enhanced reliability, utilizing a secondary DNS service that can automatically take over if the primary DNS provider fails is advisable.\n\n## Document_27\n\nThe Peplink Balance One does not have the capability to alert users about partial DNS failures; it can only notify if all DNS services have failed. Users can add third-party DNS hosts under the WAN Health Check settings, but this will not provide alerts for individual DNS host failures. Additionally, the Balance One does not serve as a primary or secondary DNS server, which could have provided a fallback option during DNS outages from the primary provider.\n\n## Document_28\n\nThe Peplink Balance One does not have the capability to serve as a primary or secondary DNS server, a feature that is available on the Balance 305 and higher models. Users can check the Balance Model Comparison for detailed specifications. For DNS redundancy, users may consider utilizing third-party DNS providers that offer failover capabilities to mitigate the risk of a single point of failure in DNS services.\n\n## Document_29\n\nTo troubleshoot connectivity issues with a Peplink Balance One on a Spectrum Cable with Static IP, it is suggested to disable Peplink health checks and use a tool like Multi-Ping to assess actual connectivity. The issues may not stem from the Balance router or modem but could be related to the network itself, and documenting findings can help in discussions with technical support.\n\n",

The issues may not stem from the Balance router or modem but could be related to the network itself, and documenting findings can help in discussions with technical support."

    "query": "How can changing DNS settings and health check targets affect WAN stability and troubleshooting on Pepwave and Peplink devices, and what are best practices for configuring these settings to avoid false disconnects or DNS-related outages?",
    "answer": "Changing DNS settings and health check targets on Pepwave and Peplink devices can have a significant impact on WAN stability. Using unreliable ISP-provided DNS servers for health checks can result in false WAN disconnects and intermittent internet access, as the device may aggressively mark a WAN as down if DNS queries fail. To mitigate this, it is a common and effective best practice to switch WAN DNS servers and health check targets to reliable public DNS providers such as Google (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4), which improves the reliability of health checks and reduces unnecessary disconnects.\n\nFor further reliability, it is advisable to configure both a primary (typically the ISP DNS for low latency) and a backup public DNS server, ensuring redundancy in case one provider fails. Additionally, on some Peplink models, health check methods can be changed from DNS lookups to pinging a website or the WAN's default gateway, which may offer more consistent results and help avoid false negatives, especially if repeated DNS queries risk being blocked by the ISP or if the DNS server itself is unreliable.\n\nDisabling health checks entirely can be a temporary workaround for persistent false disconnects, but it may result in unnoticed outages. Therefore, maintaining health checks with reliable targets is preferable for critical environments. When using multiple WANs, proper configuration of DNS and health check targets, alongside accurate WAN bandwidth settings and priority algorithms, further enhances stability and performance. Lastly, Peplink devices do not serve as DNS servers themselves and only alert on total DNS failures, so using third-party DNS providers with failover capabilities is recommended for environments requiring high uptime.",

Users can also manually enter names directly into the client list by clicking on the existing name, even if the address is not reserved.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Peplink Balance 210 supports up to 10,000 concurrent NAT sessions. For detailed specifications, it is advisable to contact a local Peplink partner.\n\n## Document_11\n\nTo set up SIM2 or CELLULAR 2 as an additional WAN connection on a Pepwave device, the dashboard allows for drag-and-drop selection of WAN connections. However, the command line interface (CLI) does not support switching between SIM cards; it is limited to configuring the APN. Alternatively, the device API could be utilized to create a custom application for easier management of SIM card selection.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo reserve an internal IP address for a device connected to a Pepwave MAX Transit Duo, access the dashboard and navigate to Status > Client List. By selecting the appropriate icon next to the device's MAC address, the router will assign the same IP address to that device each time it connects.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Pepwave MAX does not support modifying parameters through SNMP, as it is read-only.

Previously, firmware updates were only available for in-warranty devices, but this policy has changed. All devices come with a one-year warranty, which can be extended for an additional one or two years through the purchase of an extended warranty license. There is no indication that Peplink will revert to a paid firmware update model in the future.\n\n## Document_24\n\nTo set a static IP address for a device connected to a Surf SOHO MK3, navigate to the STATUS screen in the web admin app, then click on CLIENT LIST. From there, you can make the current IP address of any connected device static by clicking on the tag logo at the end of the entry.\n\n## Document_25\n\nPeplink modems can send notifications to a server using the InControl2 platform, which allows users to enable specific notification types and set a URL for posting these notifications.

This allows logging into the device via the Remote Web Admin feature without needing the password, provided the device is still under warranty.\n\n## Document_27\n\nReplacing the CMOS battery in a Balance 305 may lead to the resetting of CMOS settings, which can cause display issues and alter the boot order, particularly in older models. However, the password remains intact, preventing changes to those settings. There is a suggestion that Peplink could improve usability by sharing the BIOS password for older models to facilitate recovery.\n\n## Document_28\n\nFirmware updates for Peplink devices are now available to all users, regardless of whether they have an active support contract. This change allows users to access firmware updates without needing to purchase a support license after the initial one-year period.\n\n## Document_29\n\nThe Pepwave Max BR1 Mk2 is a single modem, dual SIM device that allows users to manually select which SIM card to use or have the router automatically choose based on performance. Users can select options such as 'Both SIMs' or force the use of 'SIM A Only' or 'SIM B Only.' In contrast, devices with multiple modems, like the Transit Duo, allow each modem to be listed as a separate WAN connection, enabling users to drag and drop connections and select SIMs for each modem individually.\n\n## Document_30\n\nFor users of the BR1 Mini, the InControl2 App can be utilized on Apple iOS devices instead of the Peplink Router Utility for easier management. This is particularly useful for those who may not be very IT literate.\n\n## Document_31\n\nWhen downloading a configuration file from a Pepwave MAX Transit, the device name and device ID are included, which can lead to conflicts when creating VPN tunnels if multiple devices share the same ID. The Device-ID is assigned when the device communicates with InControl, and applying the configuration file after this communication should not override the ID assigned by InControl. If the device has not communicated with InControl, it will use the Device-ID from the configuration file instead.\n\n## Document_32\n\nThe terminal blocks on the device are designed for directly connected power only and do not include a timer function or ignition switch sensing. For the ability to switch off the device after a certain period following the engine being turned off, a third-party in-vehicle DC-DC power supply controller would be required.\n\n## Document_33\n\nTo enable a Pepwave BR1 device to switch off automatically after a specified time when the engine is turned off, an off timer delay module can be used. These modules are available for around 3 USD and can be found on platforms like eBay. They typically offer a range of time settings from 0.1 seconds to 1 hour, include protection against power reversal, and can handle large current loads of up to 10A for both AC and DC. The delay can be adjusted using a potentiometer.\n\n## Document_34\n\nTo power the Pepwave MAX BR1, connect the DC terminal to the negative (-) and positive (+) pins. The I/P & O/P pin is a scheduled feature that allows the BR1 to monitor and provide power status information for the device.\n\n## Document_35\n\nThe Peplink Surf SOHO router is recommended for home users interested in security due to its regular firmware updates. Users can manually download firmware and security updates from Peplink's support page, but it is unclear if there are any costs associated with these updates or how long they will be available. Additionally, Peplink routers do not support OpenVPN directly, but users can still connect to VPN servers using client software on their PCs while the router is in use.\n\n",

      "Firmware updates for Peplink devices are now available to all users, regardless of whether they have an active support contract. This change allows users to access firmware updates without needing to purchase a support license after the initial one-year period.",
      "The Pepwave Max BR1 Mk2 is a single modem, dual SIM device that allows users to manually select which SIM card to use or have the router automatically choose based on performance. Users can select options such as 'Both SIMs' or force the use of 'SIM A Only' or 'SIM B Only.' In contrast, devices with multiple modems, like the Transit Duo, allow each modem to be listed as a separate WAN connection, enabling users to drag and drop connections and select SIMs for each modem individually.",
      "For users of the BR1 Mini, the InControl2 App can be utilized on Apple iOS devices instead of the Peplink Router Utility for easier management. This is particularly useful for those who may not be very IT literate.",
      "When downloading a configuration file from a Pepwave MAX Transit, the device name and device ID are included, which can lead to conflicts when creating VPN tunnels if multiple devices share the same ID. The Device-ID is assigned when the device communicates with InControl, and applying the configuration file after this communication should not override the ID assigned by InControl. If the device has not communicated with InControl, it will use the Device-ID from the configuration file instead.",
      "The terminal blocks on the device are designed for directly connected power only and do not include a timer function or ignition switch sensing. For the ability to switch off the device after a certain period following the engine being turned off, a third-party in-vehicle DC-DC power supply controller would be required.",
      "To enable a Pepwave BR1 device to switch off automatically after a specified time when the engine is turned off, an off timer delay module can be used. These modules are available for around 3 USD and can be found on platforms like eBay. They typically offer a range of time settings from 0.1 seconds to 1 hour, include protection against power reversal, and can handle large current loads of up to 10A for both AC and DC. The delay can be adjusted using a potentiometer.",
      "To power the Pepwave MAX BR1, connect the DC terminal to the negative (-) and positive (+) pins. The I/P & O/P pin is a scheduled feature that allows the BR1 to monitor and provide power status information for the device.",
      "The Peplink Surf SOHO router is recommended for home users interested in security due to its regular firmware updates. Users can manually download firmware and security updates from Peplink's support page, but it is unclear if there are any costs associated with these updates or how long they will be available. Additionally, Peplink routers do not support OpenVPN directly, but users can still connect to VPN servers using client software on their PCs while the router is in use."

    "query": "How can a technician use device names for client devices in both DHCP reservation and client list contexts across Pepwave devices, and what are the limitations or manual steps involved?",
    "answer": "A technician can assign device names to client devices in multiple ways across Pepwave devices. For devices connected via DHCP, if a device is in the DHCP reservation list or provides its own system name (such as from a Windows device), the client list will display that name automatically. If not, a technician can manually edit the device name directly in the client list by clicking on the current name (often the MAC address) and entering a preferred name; this applies to both the Pepwave BR1 and Surf SOHO models. This process allows for more meaningful identification of devices instead of relying on MAC addresses. However, there is no automated way to include the device name as a variable in SSID settings in InControl2, and some naming conflicts may arise when downloading configuration files (where device names and IDs are embedded and cannot be excluded or easily changed). Thus, while device names can be manually managed for local identification and DHCP purposes, there are limitations for automated or large-scale SSID variable assignment and configuration export scenarios.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_2\n\nTo find the MAC address of a Pepwave Surf SOHO router, log into the router's user interface and navigate to the Status Tab > Device, where both the LAN and WAN MAC addresses will be displayed.\n\n## Document_3\n\nTo track how much traffic is used by a device over time, InControl device reports can be utilized. These reports provide detailed insights into traffic usage for connected devices.\n\n## Document_4\n\nTo achieve traffic isolation for video streams across two WAN links, it is suggested to implement a persistence rule set to 'Least Used' to distribute devices across the WANs effectively. This approach aims to prevent multiple video streams from being routed through the same WAN link, which is crucial given the ISP's limitation on the number of streams per link. However, caution is advised as some servers may not handle changes in public IP addresses during streaming sessions well.\n\n## Document_5\n\nTo ensure that each device in a household uses a different WAN link for video streaming, it is recommended to separate devices by IP addresses and create outgoing policies that prioritize WAN1 for one user's devices and WAN2 for the other user's devices. This setup can be enhanced by using DHCP reservations to assign specific IP addresses to each user. Additionally, policies can be restricted to apply only to the streaming ports to manage bandwidth effectively and prevent timeout issues due to ISP stream limits.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe current firmware versions for the device are 6.3.4 and 7.0.2, which include the latest security fixes. It is recommended to use firmware version 6.3.4 or higher to ensure device security and functionality.\n\n## Document_7\n\nInControl 2 supports generating reports that display the MAC addresses of user devices along with their usage over a specified period. Users can access this information under Reports > Device Reports, where clicking on the hyperlinked client names reveals their MAC addresses and usage data for the last 30 days.\n\n## Document_8\n\nCurrently, the Pepwave client list does not provide total traffic moved by MAC address, only live data. This limitation can lead to difficulties in identifying which device is responsible for high data usage, particularly in environments with many DHCP clients. The need for MAC address-based monitoring is emphasized, especially for users who may face significant overage charges on mobile data plans. Competing products from brands like Lancom and TP-Link offer this feature, highlighting a gap in Pepwave's reporting capabilities.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO Mk3 is experiencing random reboots, which may be related to overheating when placed on top of a cable modem. After moving it away from the modem, the device initially functioned without issues for about 20 hours before rebooting again. The device is running the latest firmware and has multiple devices connected via WiFi and Ethernet, with an unmanaged switch planned for future connection. Checking the logs did not reveal any specific reasons for the reboots.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Surf Soho Mk3 router has a 'WiFi as WAN' feature, but users have reported issues with the WiFi disappearing intermittently after initial setup. After the first day of operation, the WiFi connection becomes unavailable, requiring a hard reset and reconfiguration to restore functionality. Additionally, the router's CPU can spike to 100% workload, causing all connected devices to lose their connection, particularly when applying changes in settings. Upgrading to the latest firmware has been attempted without resolving the issue.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe user is experiencing issues with the Surf Soho Mk3 router, specifically with the WiFi as WAN feature, where the WiFi SSID disappears intermittently despite the router showing normal operational status. The user has performed hard resets and firmware upgrades but continues to face connectivity issues. The CPU workload occasionally spikes to 100%, causing all connected devices to lose their connection. A suggestion is made to revert to firmware version 7.1.2 to see if it resolves the issues, as firmware 8 may have introduced problems. Additionally, it is advised to avoid using WPA3 due to its newness and potential instability.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe Surf Soho MK3 is experiencing issues with a dedicated hotspot/MiFi device connected via a 2.4GHz WiFi WAN connection, hanging up multiple times. Troubleshooting steps taken include removing other 2.4GHz WiFi profiles, disabling the WiFi AP, and adjusting settings such as MTU and switching from DHCP to a static IP. The device is running the latest firmware version 8.1.0 build 4941, and when it hangs, InControl2 reports it as offline, although the primary WAN connection remains operational.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Surf SOHO MK3 is experiencing frequent lockups while connected to a cellular hotspot using WiFi as WAN, resulting in the disappearance of the WiFi network and inability to access the unit or reset it via the physical button. The issue persists even after updating the firmware from version 6.3.3 to 7.0.2 and performing a factory reset. During the lockup state, the device does not assign IP addresses via DHCP when connected via Ethernet, requiring a power cycle to restore functionality.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe Surf SOHO MK3 is experiencing issues where the WiFi disappears, requiring power cycling to restore functionality. The device was initially on firmware version 6.3.3 and was updated to 7.0.2, but the problem persisted. During the locked state, the unit cannot be accessed or reset via the physical button. Additionally, a user reported similar issues with their MK3, where the 2nd and 3rd SSIDs stop broadcasting while the 1st SSID remains functional. A workaround involved scheduling the radio to turn off and on, but the scheduling feature has limitations with a 30-minute granularity. The network setup includes multiple SSIDs on different VLANs and various WAN connections, including Ethernet and USB to hotspots.\n\n## Document_15\n\nTo diagnose the issue of a Surf SOHO router locking up, it is recommended to log into the router from the LAN to check the WAN status and to use InControl2 for logging the router's uptime and downtime. The problem may stem from the handshake between the router and the cable modem, which has been a known issue with some cable modems. Checking the cable modem's log can help determine if the modem is going offline, indicating a communication failure rather than a router failure. Setting the WAN definition to always use full duplex and gigabit speeds may help avoid handshake issues.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe Surf SOHO router has experienced lockups approximately every 60-90 days since its purchase in December 2017, with the last occurrence noted on July 22. The router is running hardware revision 1 and firmware version 7.1.0 build 1284, while it is connected to an Arris SB6190 cable modem with a stable connection. The user has multiple WiFi networks, including VLANs, and has not enabled remote access or port forwarding. When the router locks up, the user cannot access it via WiFi, and the Arlo cameras connected to the LAN port go offline, indicating a loss of WAN connectivity. Power cycling the router temporarily resolves the issue. To diagnose the problem further, obtaining a diagnostic report from the router is recommended.\n\n## Document_17\n\nInControl2's usage column may show blank data if it is not receiving updates from the device. For real-time usage information, users should refer to the device's Bandwidth and Usage Reports, which provide detailed insights into data consumption.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe IC2 system is responsible for processing configuration requests and pushing updates, which typically occurs within a minute, depending on system load. If updates are taking longer than expected while on a stable connection, it is advised to submit a support ticket with the device serial number for further investigation.\n\n## Document_19\n\nIn InControl 2, users can generate reports that show the MAC addresses of user devices along with their usage over specified periods such as Today, Yesterday, the last 7 days, the last 31 days, or a custom period. Detailed information about specific clients can be accessed by clicking on the hyperlinked clients within the report.\n\n## Document_20\n\nWhen experiencing issues with the Surf Soho Mk3 router where the WiFi SSID disappears, it is important to check the Client List via an Ethernet connection and review the AP log for any unusual events. The Dashboard should indicate whether the SSIDs are active. High CPU usage, particularly spikes to 100% when applying changes, is normal and may cause temporary disconnections. It is recommended to use the latest firmware version, 8.1.1 Release Candidate 3, for optimal performance.\n\n## Document_21\n\nThe Surf SOHO MK3 is experiencing frequent lockups where the WiFi disappears and the device becomes unresponsive, requiring power cycling to restore functionality. The issue persists even after updating the firmware from version 6.3.3 to 7.0.2 build 1253 and performing a factory reset. During the locked state, the device does not allow access via Ethernet or a factory reset using the physical button. The device is configured to use WiFi as WAN without any hardwired connections, and the Event Log page is blank, indicating no recorded events during these failures. A suggestion was made to try using a static IP address for troubleshooting.\n\n## Document_22\n\nThe Surf SOHO MK3 is experiencing frequent lockups where the WiFi disappears and the device becomes unresponsive, requiring a power cycle to restore functionality. The issue persists even after updating the firmware from 6.3.3 to 7.0.2 build 1253 and performing a factory reset. During the locked state, the device does not respond to DHCP requests over Ethernet, and the physical reset button does not function, necessitating a power cycle to reset the system.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe Surf SOHO MK3 is experiencing frequent lockups where the WiFi disappears and the device becomes unresponsive, requiring a power cycle to restore functionality. The issue persists even after updating the firmware from version 6.3.3 to 7.0.2 and performing a factory reset. During the locked state, the device does not respond to DHCP requests over Ethernet, and attempts to access the router via a static IP address also fail. The indicator lights remain solid without activity, indicating a lack of normal operation.\n\n## Document_24\n\nConfiguration changes applied to devices managed by IC2 cloud should typically take 1 to 2 minutes to reflect at the device level, assuming the devices maintain a stable connection to the IC2 cloud.\n\n## Document_25\n\nIC2 is capable of handling most day-to-day VPN configuration scenarios. The choice of using IC2 or a firmware-only feature depends on user comfort and the size of the implementation, as device-by-device configuration does not scale well beyond single-digit node counts.\n\n## Document_26\n\nUsing InControl, the VPN configuration can be deployed to devices in a matter of minutes, typically within 5 minutes, even if the remote end is on a cellular connection achieving 3G speeds.\n\n",

This approach aims to prevent multiple video streams from being routed through the same WAN link, which is crucial given the ISP's limitation on the number of streams per link. However, caution is advised as some servers may not handle changes in public IP addresses during streaming sessions well.",
      "To ensure that each device in a household uses a different WAN link for video streaming, it is recommended to separate devices by IP addresses and create outgoing policies that prioritize WAN1 for one user's devices and WAN2 for the other user's devices. This setup can be enhanced by using DHCP reservations to assign specific IP addresses to each user. Additionally, policies can be restricted to apply only to the streaming ports to manage bandwidth effectively and prevent timeout issues due to ISP stream limits.",
      "The current firmware versions for the device are 6.3.4 and 7.0.2, which include the latest security fixes. It is recommended to use firmware version 6.3.4 or higher to ensure device security and functionality.",
      "InControl 2 supports generating reports that display the MAC addresses of user devices along with their usage over a specified period. Users can access this information under Reports > Device Reports, where clicking on the hyperlinked client names reveals their MAC addresses and usage data for the last 30 days.",
      "Currently, the Pepwave client list does not provide total traffic moved by MAC address, only live data. This limitation can lead to difficulties in identifying which device is responsible for high data usage, particularly in environments with many DHCP clients. The need for MAC address-based monitoring is emphasized, especially for users who may face significant overage charges on mobile data plans. Competing products from brands like Lancom and TP-Link offer this feature, highlighting a gap in Pepwave's reporting capabilities.",
      "The Pepwave Surf SOHO Mk3 is experiencing random reboots, which may be related to overheating when placed on top of a cable modem. After moving it away from the modem, the device initially functioned without issues for about 20 hours before rebooting again. The device is running the latest firmware and has multiple devices connected via WiFi and Ethernet, with an unmanaged switch planned for future connection. Checking the logs did not reveal any specific reasons for the reboots.",
      "The Surf Soho Mk3 router has a 'WiFi as WAN' feature, but users have reported issues with the WiFi disappearing intermittently after initial setup. After the first day of operation, the WiFi connection becomes unavailable, requiring a hard reset and reconfiguration to restore functionality. Additionally, the router's CPU can spike to 100% workload, causing all connected devices to lose their connection, particularly when applying changes in settings. Upgrading to the latest firmware has been attempted without resolving the issue.",
      "The user is experiencing issues with the Surf Soho Mk3 router, specifically with the WiFi as WAN feature, where the WiFi SSID disappears intermittently despite the router showing normal operational status. The user has performed hard resets and firmware upgrades but continues to face connectivity issues. The CPU workload occasionally spikes to 100%, causing all connected devices to lose their connection. A suggestion is made to revert to firmware version 7.1.2 to see if it resolves the issues, as firmware 8 may have introduced problems. Additionally, it is advised to avoid using WPA3 due to its newness and potential instability.",
      "The Surf Soho MK3 is experiencing issues with a dedicated hotspot/MiFi device connected via a 2.4GHz WiFi WAN connection, hanging up multiple times. Troubleshooting steps taken include removing other 2.4GHz WiFi profiles, disabling the WiFi AP, and adjusting settings such as MTU and switching from DHCP to a static IP. The device is running the latest firmware version 8.1.0 build 4941, and when it hangs, InControl2 reports it as offline, although the primary WAN connection remains operational.",
      "The Surf SOHO MK3 is experiencing frequent lockups while connected to a cellular hotspot using WiFi as WAN, resulting in the disappearance of the WiFi network and inability to access the unit or reset it via the physical button. The issue persists even after updating the firmware from version 6.3.3 to 7.0.2 and performing a factory reset. During the lockup state, the device does not assign IP addresses via DHCP when connected via Ethernet, requiring a power cycle to restore functionality.",
      "The Surf SOHO MK3 is experiencing issues where the WiFi disappears, requiring power cycling to restore functionality. The device was initially on firmware version 6.3.3 and was updated to 7.0.2, but the problem persisted. During the locked state, the unit cannot be accessed or reset via the physical button. Additionally, a user reported similar issues with their MK3, where the 2nd and 3rd SSIDs stop broadcasting while the 1st SSID remains functional. A workaround involved scheduling the radio to turn off and on, but the scheduling feature has limitations with a 30-minute granularity. The network setup includes multiple SSIDs on different VLANs and various WAN connections, including Ethernet and USB to hotspots.",
      "To diagnose the issue of a Surf SOHO router locking up, it is recommended to log into the router from the LAN to check the WAN status and to use InControl2 for logging the router's uptime and downtime. The problem may stem from the handshake between the router and the cable modem, which has been a known issue with some cable modems. Checking the cable modem's log can help determine if the modem is going offline, indicating a communication failure rather than a router failure. Setting the WAN definition to always use full duplex and gigabit speeds may help avoid handshake issues.",
      "The Surf SOHO router has experienced lockups approximately every 60-90 days since its purchase in December 2017, with the last occurrence noted on July 22. The router is running hardware revision 1 and firmware version 7.1.0 build 1284, while it is connected to an Arris SB6190 cable modem with a stable connection. The user has multiple WiFi networks, including VLANs, and has not enabled remote access or port forwarding. When the router locks up, the user cannot access it via WiFi, and the Arlo cameras connected to the LAN port go offline, indicating a loss of WAN connectivity. Power cycling the router temporarily resolves the issue. To diagnose the problem further, obtaining a diagnostic report from the router is recommended.",
      "InControl2's usage column may show blank data if it is not receiving updates from the device. For real-time usage information, users should refer to the device's Bandwidth and Usage Reports, which provide detailed insights into data consumption.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_2\n\nThe Balance TWO supports the Max Adapter, which provides a faster way to establish a cellular connection for devices that do not have an embedded cellular module. For more details on supported models, users can refer to the Peplink website.\n\n## Document_3\n\nWhen using a Peplink Balance 30 Pro LTEA, if a health check fails on a specific WAN link, the modem behind that WAN becomes inaccessible. Attempts to access the modem from the Balance's LAN while other WAN ports are online result in failure to ping or access the GUI of the connected device. Disabling other WAN ports allows access, but this is not a practical solution in the field. A configuration that allows access to the WAN device regardless of the health check status while still maintaining health checks for outbound policy is needed.\n\n## Document_4\n\nIf one Balance 30 router successfully upgraded to firmware version 8.1 while the other remains on version 5.3.12, it is possible that the router stuck on 5.3.12 was too outdated to perform a direct upgrade to 8.1.0. It is also recommended to check if both routers are the exact same hardware revision, as differences in hardware could affect firmware compatibility and upgrade paths.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe Peplink Balance 30PRO model includes a Wi-Fi interface, allowing for wireless connections and SSID broadcasting, whereas the Balance 30LTE model does not have a Wi-Fi interface and only supports AP Controller functionality. If the wireless connection is enabled but the SSID is not visible, it is important to confirm the specific model of the Balance 30 being used.\n\n## Document_6\n\nTo direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on a Peplink Balance 20/30 series router, navigate to the Network settings and set the Outbound Policy to 'Managed by Custom Rules'. Retain the default rules 'HTTPS Persistence' and 'Default', and then add new rules to enforce traffic from specific LAN clients to designated WANs. After creating the rules, ensure to click 'Save' and then 'Apply Changes' to implement them.\n\n## Document_7\n\nAfter performing a factory reset on a Balance 380 router, all configuration settings should be restored using a backup .conf file. However, it is uncertain whether the Event Logs will be retained, as the factory reset may permanently erase them.\n\n## Document_8\n\nA Peplink Balance 20 or 30 can combine both DSL and cable internet connections for load balancing and automatic failover, ensuring continuous connectivity. The AP One access points are suitable for enhancing wireless coverage in larger homes, utilizing TruePower RF technology for increased signal strength. The AP One operates on the 2.4GHz band, while the AP One mini supports 5GHz, which may require compatible devices for optimal performance.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe Peplink Balance 300 has a listed capacity of 20 domains, with additional limitations on DNS records per domain, including 5 NS records, 5 MX records, 30 CNAME records, and 30 IP addresses for A records. Users have reported issues with the device not retaining more than 71 domain names after a power cycle, indicating that the device may not handle more than its specified capacity. The device is also noted to have not received firmware updates since 2009, leading to unresolved bugs, including the lack of SMTP authentication for SMTP forwarding, which is critical for modern ISPs.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe CAT18 cellular module used in the Flexmodule mini for Balance20X and Expansion module for Balance310X is confirmed to be the Telit LM960A18. When comparing the performance of the Telit LM960A18 to the Sierra EM7565 CAT12, users may experience differences in sensitivity and efficiency, particularly in good signal conditions with SINR values between 15-30dB and RSRP values between 75-90dB. Expected gains in upload and download speeds can vary based on these conditions, but specific metrics are not provided in the conversation.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Balance 30 LTEA has been updated and renamed to Balance 30 Pro, featuring a new hardware revision that includes CAT6 LTE-Advanced, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and 4x PoE LAN ports. The classic Balance 30 LTE retains its CAT3 LTE configuration, while the new Balance 30 Pro offers enhanced capabilities with LTE-Advanced technology.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe Peplink Balance 300, which is approximately 15 years old, supports a maximum throughput of 20Mbps. Therefore, if clients are experiencing a maximum speed of 15Mbps, this is within the expected performance limits of the device, despite having three WAN connections with a total potential speed of 300Mbps.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Balance 300 router supports a maximum throughput of 20mbps per user, despite having three WAN connections each capable of 100mbps. This means that while the total potential speed from the WAN connections is 300mbps, the router's limitations restrict the actual usable speed to 20mbps per user, indicating that the additional bandwidth from the WAN connections is not utilized effectively.\n\n## Document_14\n\nEnabling VLANs on a Balance 1350 router does not cause any downtime, allowing for configuration changes without interrupting the network service.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Balance 1350 HW2 is rated to support 1,000,000 concurrent sessions.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo set up a Point to Point PepLink VPN tunnel between Balance 210-A and Balance 210-C, it is important to note that a custom handshake port feature is not currently available. The handshake port is global to all profiles on the device and cannot be set through the existing PepVPN management UI.\n\n## Document_17\n\nWhen setting up a home router for a Verizon LTE connection with PepVPN capability, a common issue with USB modems is overheating after prolonged use. For bandwidth considerations, it is important to check the routing throughput of the selected model against the maximum bandwidth provided by the Verizon LTE connection, ensuring that the router's throughput is equal to or higher than the LTE connection's capabilities.\n\n## Document_18\n\nTo load balance over 10 VDSL routers using a single WAN interface, a suitable device would be a Peplink SD-WAN router that supports multiple WAN interfaces. Options include the Balance 1350 or Balance 2500, which can handle 10 WAN interfaces, or using three Balance Ones, where two of them can be unlocked to support 5 WANs each via an add-on license. This setup allows for effective load balancing while considering throughput requirements of over 300 Mbps.\n\n## Document_19\n\nWhen a PepVPN tunnel is idle, the bandwidth usage for routing health checks every 10 seconds is 96 bytes, while for tunnel health checks every 15 seconds, it is 480 bytes. This information is relevant for understanding bandwidth consumption when configuring a PepVPN connection without encryption and with infrequent failure detection.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe only model of the Peplink Balance series that is not upgradeable to firmware version 6.x is the Balance 20L, which is an older unit housed in a plastic enclosure. To confirm eligibility for the upgrade, checking the serial number of the device is recommended.\n\n## Document_21\n\nThe Peplink Balance e30 is not a DSL modem and does not have RJ11 ports; it only features RJ45 Ethernet ports. To connect the Balance router to an ADSL connection, a separate DSL modem is required that provides an Ethernet output to connect to the Balance's WAN port.\n\n## Document_22\n\nTo log outbound traffic on a Balance 380 router with firmware 5.4.9, it is necessary to set an Outbound Firewall rule and enable firewall event logging. This can be configured for all traffic or specific IP ranges. However, it is advised not to keep logging enabled continuously due to potential bandwidth usage. Once enabled, reports can be viewed via the event log.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe Balance 380 has a router throughput rating of 200 Mbps, which indicates that the combined WAN upload and download speeds can potentially exceed this limit, leading to undesirable behavior. Although the router should sustain 75 Mbps of throughput, high CPU load can occur under certain conditions, affecting performance and causing issues such as failed admin page requests and internet unavailability for other users. It is advisable to open a support ticket for further investigation.\n\n## Document_24\n\nThe firmware files \"fw-b210_310_hw1-5.4.7-build1920.bin\" and \"fw-b210_310_hw2_hw3-5.4.7-build1493.bin\" correspond to different hardware revisions of the Balance 210/310. The \"hw2\" firmware should be used if the Balance 210/310 has a USB port for 4G/3G WAN.\n\n## Document_25\n\nWhen replacing a Balance 20 HW1 with a Balance 20 HW8, if the AP AC Mini's are not showing up on the AP controller and cannot be managed, it is likely due to an incompatible configuration uploaded from the HW1 to the HW8. It is recommended to create a new configuration manually on the HW8 device and ensure that the AP AC Mini's are updated to the latest firmware.\n\n## Document_26\n\nThe Surf SOHO does not support Band Steering, a feature that is available on Peplink Balance models 20, 30, and above. This means that devices connected to the Surf SOHO will join either the 2.4GHz or 5GHz band arbitrarily, which can lead to suboptimal performance, especially when trying to manage devices that require different frequency bands.\n\n## Document_27\n\nWhen considering AT&T prepaid plans for use with a Peplink device, options include a $35 plan for 15 GB or a $55 plan for 100 GB. However, there may be issues with compatibility as the system may not accept the Peplink IMEI. If a SIM card is not already available, it is necessary to visit a store to obtain one, and there are concerns about the reliability of purchasing SIM options from third-party sources like eBay.\n\n## Document_28\n\nWhen encountering an 'invalid Incontrol host' message while migrating an access point on a Privately Hosted IC2 appliance, it is advisable to check for any trailing spaces in the IP address. Removing any such spaces may resolve the issue and allow successful migration.\n\n## Document_29\n\nThe Balance Two is compatible with a Max Adapter, but the USB bus specification may limit throughput, particularly when using a 5G Adapter, which may not achieve full 5G speeds due to this limitation. This is not a design flaw but rather an implementation of the USB specification. A user reported successful operation of a 5G Adapter with a Balance 380 in a marginal signal environment, indicating effective performance despite the limitations.\n\n## Document_30\n\nTo ensure that a modem behind a WAN link remains accessible even when the health check fails, one can configure an outbound policy of 'enforced' type with the destination set to the IP of the modem and the specific WAN link in question.\n\n## Document_31\n\nTo successfully upgrade a Peplink Balance 30 router from firmware version 5.3.12 to 8.1, it may be necessary to first upgrade to an intermediate version, such as 7, before proceeding to version 8. This can be done by accessing the archived firmware versions in the router's firmware management section.\n\n## Document_32\n\nTo direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on the Peplink Balance 20/30 series, outbound policy can be utilized to control which server or type of traffic exits through which link. This ensures that return traffic comes back on the same link it was sent out on, maintaining the integrity of sessions such as FTP. If an FTP session is established on WAN1, Peplink will consistently route that FTP traffic through WAN1.\n\n## Document_33\n\nTo direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on a Peplink Balance 20/30 series router, an outbound policy rule can be created. This allows for the configuration of traffic routing, ensuring that certain types of traffic, such as FTP, are directed through a designated WAN connection without round-robin switching between multiple WANs.\n\n## Document_34\n\nTo direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on the Peplink Balance 20/30 series, it is important to explore the outbound policy settings rather than inbound rules. The outbound policy allows for the configuration of rules that can route traffic from specific devices or applications to designated WAN connections, ensuring that certain traffic, such as FTP, is consistently routed through the intended WAN without round-robin switching between multiple connections.\n\n## Document_35\n\nThe Balance 20/30 series allows for the configuration of outbound policy rules to direct specific traffic through designated WAN connections. The default outbound policy rule, set to 'Auto', utilizes a weighted balance algorithm based on the downstream bandwidth of each WAN. Users can customize this setting by changing it to 'Custom' to create specific rules for directing traffic, ensuring that certain machines, such as a server for FTP traffic, can be configured to use only a designated WAN connection without round-robin distribution between multiple WANs.\n\n## Document_36\n\nPeplink Balance devices can combine two internet connections (DSL and Cable) for load balancing and can also set one connection as a backup. Traffic prioritization and bandwidth limiting for certain users are features available on the Balance 380 or higher models. The AP One can improve wireless signal strength and can be managed remotely via a web admin page accessible from the WAN side, using dynamic DNS if a static IP is not available. The AP One X can repeat a signal from an indoor AP One if there is a good wireless connection between them, but performance may vary based on several factors that require an on-site survey to assess.\n\n## Document_37\n\nPeplink Balance routers, such as the Balance 20 and 30, can combine multiple internet connections, including DSL and Cable, for load balancing. They also support failover configurations, allowing one connection to be active while the other serves as a backup. Traffic prioritization for specific IPs can be managed through Quality of Service (QoS) settings. The AP One wireless access points can work with the Balance 30 or 310, and they can be set up individually. Additionally, the Balance WLAN Controller feature is available on Balance 380 and above, providing centralized management for both WAN and WLAN needs.\n\n## Document_38\n\nTo combine two internet connections (DSL and Cable) for load balancing, a Peplink Balance 20 or 30 can be used. These devices can also be configured for failover, allowing one connection to remain active while the other is used only when the primary fails. Traffic prioritization for specific IPs is possible, and remote management is supported. For wireless access points, the AP One can work with the Balance 30 or 310, but it is important to check compatibility and setup individually. The APs operate in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, which can help mitigate interference issues in environments with congested 2.4 GHz bands.\n\n## Document_39\n\nThe CAT18 cellular module used in the Pepwave Balance 20X and Balance 310X is confirmed to be the Telit LM960A18. The CAT12 modules are identified as the Sierra EM7511 or EM7565. The Sierra EM7690 is noted as the CAT20 module, while the Thales MVW31 is used for 5G alongside the Sierra EM9191. The performance of the CAT18 module is expected to be similar to that of the CAT12 modules in terms of signal sensitivity and efficiency, with higher category modules providing better carrier aggregation (CA) combinations. However, it is mentioned that CAT12 modules may not achieve more than 3+CA in practice. The Sierra modules are preferred for their regular updates and better documentation.\n\n## Document_40\n\nThe BPL-031-LTEA-W-T is End of Life (EOL) under that specific SKU, but the same device is still available under the part number BPL-031-LTE-US-T. This indicates that while one version may be discontinued, a similar or equivalent version remains on the market.\n\n## Document_41\n\nTo set up a Point to Point PepLink VPN tunnel between Balance 210-A and Balance 210-C, it is necessary to use custom handshake and data ports for PepVPN on Balance 210-C. These ports must be forwarded through Balance 210-B. The PepVPN profile on Balance 210-A should be configured to connect to the public IP of Balance 210-B using the specified custom ports.\n\n## Document_42\n\nWhen comparing a Pepwave Balance 20 with a USB modem to a Balance 30LTE using a Verizon SIM card, the connection between the Balance 20 and the USB modem may impose limitations on bandwidth. The Balance 30LTE is designed for direct cellular connectivity and may provide better data speeds compared to the Balance 20 with a USB modem, assuming both are on the same carrier.\n\n",

    "query": "How can a technician configure a Peplink Balance 20/30 series router to ensure specific machines or types of traffic are routed only through designated WAN connections, and what are the effects of the default settings versus custom rules?",
    "answer": "On a Peplink Balance 20/30 series router, to ensure that specific machines or types of traffic are routed exclusively through designated WAN connections, the technician should adjust the outbound policy settings. By default, the outbound policy is set to 'Auto', which uses a weighted balance algorithm based on the downstream bandwidth of each WAN interface. This means traffic is distributed according to the available bandwidth, and there is no guarantee that a specific machine or type of traffic will always use the same WAN connection, potentially causing session integrity issues for protocols like FTP.\n\nTo override this, the technician must change the outbound policy to 'Custom Rules' and retain the default 'HTTPS Persistence' and 'Default' rules. Then, new rules should be added specifying the source (such as a particular LAN client or traffic type) and the WAN connection that should be used. This ensures that traffic from specified devices or applications is routed only through the intended WAN, avoiding round-robin distribution and maintaining session integrity. After creating these rules, it is essential to save and apply the changes.
