# ## Example
#
# This notebook demonstrates how to use [Zep](https://www.getzep.com/) as memory for your chatbot.
# REACT Agent Chat Message History with Zep - A long-term memory store for LLM applications.
#
# We'll demonstrate:
#
# 1. Adding conversation history to Zep.
# 2. Running an agent and having message automatically added to the store.
# 3. Viewing the enriched messages.
# 4. Vector search over the conversation history.
