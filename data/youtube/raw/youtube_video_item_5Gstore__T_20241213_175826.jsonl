CGI and hit enter scroll down until you see Fusion Sim agent and click to configure check the enable box and change the port if needed then click save go back to the index.cgi page and apply the changes now we need to log into the Sim injector and confirm its data Port matches what we have set for the fusion Sim agent default is 50,000 so you can skip this if you have not changed it at this point we need to connect to the fusion Sim settings go to fc. pink.com and log in with your peplink ID select or enter in the provider you will be using to start the dashboard page should now load go to platforms on the left and add the Sim injector for network setup we're going to select use custom IP address and enter in the public IP address from our br1 Pro router again we'll use the same data Port as the fusion Sim agent under Sim inventory you should see all Sim injector available SIM cards but it will be listed as unusable no contract click Sim contracts and add one make sure you select the proper country then click on the newly created contract name and add SIM cards to it added SIM cards will become green and available to use like shown here refer to the fusion Sim menu and click distribution rules add one here click on the newly created rule name and add contract to it when done click save and it should look like this next click subscriptions and add one once created click on the newly added subscription name and add the distribution rule to it finally it's time to add a Remote device that will receive the fusion Sim in our case we're going to add our ubr plus click on devices and add the serial number of the Remote device note that if GPS is not available then add the proper manual location and save the settings after a few minutes the device should come online at this time we will click on it serial number and assign the subscription to it at the Remote device we also need to confirm it is set to connect to a remote Sim log into its web Administration page and click on The Cellular Connection in the details window scroll down to Cellular settings and find the SIM card setting they should be set on custom selection with remote Sim checked only if everything was set up correctly the remote device should receive the SIM card via Fusion Sim and the cellular link should appear on the platform as shown here you can also click on the cellular one button here and we can view its connection and Link details that sums up the instructions for setting up Fusion Sim we hope you enjoyed this video and thank you for watching for more videos like this we welcome you to hit the Subscribe button", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2023-08-28T22:00:22Z", "channelId": "UCPfPFshSC-rH4IbaClXrWSQ", "title": "Peplink - How to Use FusionSIM", "description": "FusionSIM technology allows users to access SIM cards outside of its integrated SIM slots.

the peplink SD switch configuration is typically done from in control 2 but you can also connect to the management port in order to configure the device locally note that if you plan on configuring locally you will need to disable the in-control management you'll find this within the web admin under the system Tab and in control alternatively configure this option as enable restricted to status reporting only to be able to monitor the switch through and control but manage it from The Local web admin interface if you adjust this click save then apply changes now let's go back to the dashboard page at the top we can quickly see which ports Ethernet or SFP are connected or not green indicates they are connected black means they are not next we have the management interface details this includes our Management Port IP address along with any vlans that have management access below that is the external access which is its access to the internet last on this page is the device information this covers the model of our SD switch its firmware and uptime CPU load power consumption fan speed and temperature as well as the status of a and BAC power sources let's take a look at the configure tab first up is the local network settings currently these are configured through in control 2. but if you configure locally you simply need to create a new land by clicking the new land button moving to the left we have STP or spanning tree protocol this shows the STP Bridge settings and lets you configure a different priority report if needed as you can see Port 32768 is the default selection click the blue question mark to the right corner here if you need to set any additional STP settings next up is loop protection loot detection packet interval and the recovery times can be changed here again we have a blue question mark icon clicking on it displays some details about loop protection DCP snooping can be enabled or disabled when enabled the DHCP request will be forwarded to trusted ports and only allow reply packets from trusted ports default mode is trusted but you have the option of setting it to untrust it if needed qos or quality of service settings are also available classification is disabled by default but can prioritize Network traffic into eight different class of service or cos according to the tag protocol Technologies being chosen each cos provides different levels of priority and bandwidth limit here's a closer look at each section now let's move on to the access control this includes Ingress ACL or Access Control list you may add rules here as needed they also have authentication by radius that can be enabled here Port mirroring is another feature that can be enabled on your switch this feature allows traffic monitoring by setting traffic to mirror reports to destination ports under IP multicast on the left there is an option for igmp snooping this controls the delivery of ip4 multicast trafficking the igmp snooping enabled Lan or lands when this is disabled ip4 multicast traffic is always flooded below the enable box is the igmp snooping table this is on a per-lan basis so you will add a new entry on a particular LAN enable querier to join igmp query or election with the preset lens IP address if no IP address is set the default management IP is used the switch ports page under interfaces is likely the most important to most users as it covers how each Port is configured such as the port type troncore access as well as which VLAN networks they are using you can simply click on a port or multiple ports to configure how they are set up external access settings is set to Auto by default if you select custom instead you can manually select which VLAN it should connect with and its connection method here she didn't want to have it back up internet connection to your switch if the firewall is connected to fails this is where the USB modem can be used if enabled you have the option of setting manual operator settings as well as DNS servers last on the configure tab is the radius server you can set up an authentication or accounting server here onto the system tab this is where we will initially see details about the admin security settings it includes web admin login settings as well as other management settings such as the IP address and vlans that are allowed to access the web admin firmware is next if the switch is online you may use the check for firmware button to upgrade automatically or refer to the manual upgrade option to upload the firmware file time zone and time server can be set manually if needed on the schedule page you can create scheduled profiles to apply to the ethernet ports this allows you to disable access to a port as needed email notifications can be set up if you'd like to be notified of events that occur on the network such as an internet connection failure under event log you can configure a remote syslog if desired SNMP settings are supported here then we have our in control page as we saw earlier at the configuration page you may save a copy of your current configuration settings this is always advised before you upgrade firmware in case something fails with the firmware process if needed you'll also come to this page to upload the file you may also restore factory settings at this page should you ever need to reboot power to the switch you can do so from the reboot page this allows you to reboot to a previous firmware build as well last on this tab are the tools including ping trace route and Wake On LAN here's a closer look at each page finally we have the status tab as it sounds this is where we can find the status of our switch device its model number serial number and Hardware revision are here as well as this uptime you also have diagnostic tools like the report and remote assistance Hardware Mac addresses are also found at this page STP information is next then we have our Client List which is where we can find a list of all devices connected to our switch if needed you can click on different ports to only see the details about those specific connections the event law will show events as they occur as you can see here this is a good place to start troubleshooting any issues that may arise last up is the usage reports this is how much data has been used over the switch you can view this as hourly daily or monthly usage that's all for our overview of the SD switch web admin we hope you enjoyed this video and welcome you to subscribe to our channel for more videos like it thanks

to different wand interfaces for each Lan device or application you can select possible Wan interfaces and configure policies for dynamically routing traffic between the Lan and land we'll show you how to define the various multi-wan policies that determine how your router maintains or switches its Wan connectivity log into your Sierra air link router and navigate to the networking Tab and refer to multi-wan policies and multi-wan policies again this is where you can configure the top level rules for data traffic management between Lan and land air Lincoln s has two default rules already defined the default routes for ipv4 and IPv6 traffic these two rules allow you to define the devices used to carry ipv4 and IPv6 traffic they use the default system Wan Zone you can edit the WAN output fields to use other zones to configure a rule start by setting it to enabled and give it a name to identify it lead inputs specifies the source of the traffic if left blank the policy applies to all traffic when output specifies the ordered list of interfaces the traffic can be carried over default policies use the WAN Zone to define the default device order the default device preferences ethernet Wi-Fi cellular and finally USB interfaces to change the order you can either select interfaces in priority order or you can define a new Zone zones are configured under networking zones and system zones Services specifies a protocol or port number to identify the traffic if left empty all traffic types will be matched against this policy you can configure services at networking Zone settings and services source ip8 and destination IP specifies a source or destination to match against this traffic you can enter an ipv4 or ipv6ip address and airlink Os will validate it note that if both ipv4 and IPv6 traffic is to be selected two policies must be created destination fqdn is where you can specify a fully qualified domain name instead of a fixed destination IP address to use a destination fqdn clear the destination IP field click the field to select a pre-configure fqgin or click create to create a new fq key in entry you can also create a new fqdn entry under Zone settings and fully qualified domain names lastly we have priority this defines the order in which policies are evaluated in ascending order for example if you create a rule of priority 100 it will apply first and override the default 998 and 999 policies each policy must have a unique priority air link os does not allow policies with identical priorities confirm your configuration under status monitoring networking and multi-wind this will display your configured policy routes and priorities now your router is ready to Route traffic as you specified note that When selecting a Wan interface from the set of interfaces defined in Wan outputs whether it be for the default IP traffic or your own policies the default ranking is based on the following whether the interface is connected or not meaning it has an IP address the user defined or system default order for traffic and Link validation which means whether the interface has internet connectivity the link validation is configured at the networking Network wash job page to further refine how the system determines which interface is usable you can apply additional rules to your multi-wan policies Beyond basic network connectivity these rules include roaming avoidance signal strength connected Wi-Fi and current vehicle speed let's start with roaming avoidance rules this asks the router is the cellular device actively roaming enable will activate this rule importance is either mandatory or optional when the rule is set to mandatory the WAN interface must never be used if roaming disable to make the rule optional when the rule is optional the WAN interface should not be used if roaming and another Wan interface is available if no other interface is available use this optional interface even if it is roaming apply this roaming rule against the specified Wan policy next apply this rule against the specified interface used in the WAN policy configured in applies to policy note that this must be a cellular interface last you can constrain the roaming policy to a network operator so that the roaming rule applies only if currently connected to the specified provider signal strength rules can be configured here let the roaming rules set the enable and mandatory options as needed apply this signal strength rule against the specified Wan policy next apply this rule against the specified interface used in the WAN policy configured and applies to policy this can either be a cellular or Wi-Fi interface usable unusable signal strengths can be configured in either abstracted signal bar strength or RSSI click create signal strength rule to configure and add a signal strength rule Wi-Fi SSID rules are next again like the previous rules set the enable and mandatory options as needed apply this SS ID rule against the specified Wan policy apply this rule against the specified interface used in the WAN policy configured and applies to policy note that this must be a Wi-Fi Wan interface the room becomes active if the Wi-Fi client is commonly connected to one of the specified SS IDs see Wi-Fi SNS ID database for the list of ssides available to be added to this rule to complete this rule set the traffic policy when SSID matches options are either forward which means the interface can be considered usable if connected to the specified SS IDs or you may block which means the interface will not be usable if connected to the specified SS IDs lastly we have vehicle speed rules once more set enabled and importance as needed apply the speed rule against the specified Wan policy apply this rule against the specify interface used in the WAN policy configured and applies to policy threshold is read in miles per hour when the vehicle speed is above this threshold the speed rule will inhibit traffic on the selected Wan interface recovery time is read in seconds once the vehicle speed has exceeded the threshold and data traffic is dropped recovery time specifies how long the vehicle must be below the speed threshold before traffic is permitted on the selected Wan interface that sums up our configuration and options for multi-wan policies on Sierra Wireless air link OS we hope you

open a web browser to the administration page at 192.168.0.1 log in using the default username of admin followed by the unique password from the bottom of the router once you're logged in we need to change the default administrator password navigate to the system tab on the left side menu select Administration then router security note the password minimum length here which is currently seven

check our internet connection I currently have a Verizon sim card inserted we'll also be connecting an Ethernet win later navigate to The Connection Manager page from the left find The Cellular Connection and it should indicate whether it is connected it appears to be but should yours fail it's possible you need to manually enter the APN or access point name for the SIM this comes from the cellular carrier in case you need to confirm what it is start by selecting The Cellular Connection then click the edit button at the top in the window that opens click on Sim slash AP and slash off set the AP and slash DNN to default override then enter your AP and in the field below AP and Tide can be left as modem default click save when done then click ok at this time it's normal for the modem connection to disappear while it resets its configuration give it a minute or two to refresh once your cellular has connected we can set up a verification setting this will verify whether the connection is active or not and AIDS in the failover and failback process note that this will use a minimal amount of data on your connection find the settings icon below the win verify column and it will open the configuration window when verify should be selected on the left check the box to enable the stability check for the monitor ipv4 while connected setting we recommend using the active ping method enter a ping address we're using Google's DNS server you may also adjust the timing of the stability time check and retry intervals as well as the retry count data usage settings can be configured if your Cellular Connection is metered we're going to configure that while we're here if you don't require these settings simply click save to continue click on data usage from the left and select monthly weekly or daily we're going to use monthly check the box to enable the usage monitor set the date which the data cycle starts in the month set a usage cap if you're using load balancing check this box the next options control how the router should behave when the usage cap is reached it can disconnect and require a manual reconnect to get back online you can set an alert to warn you when has reached the cap you can also set custom alerts so you can be notified When You Reach 90 of the total cap for example click save when you're done you will then need to confirm you want to enable the data usage tracker and agree that you understand CradlePoint cannot guarantee these values will match with the service provider shows click yes followed by ok now I'm going to click on the data usage tab under the WAN management here we can verify it is indeed enabled finally we'll connect our ethernet wind since this is in Priority One by default it should automatically connect and in doing so disconnect the cellular if you use a static IP connection you may select the ethernet wind edit it and enter in the static settings otherwise this should be a plug-and-place setup let's give it a few moments to see if it will establish there we go and now if we give it another moment the cellular will disconnect at this time you may also edit the WAN verify settings on the ethernet connection which is going to be the same configuration as what we did on The Cellular Connection remember to save your settings when complete that sums up our configuration from factory default

via the mobile application called easy device this is available for iPhone and Android devices if you already have an account log in here otherwise click on sign up to proceed confirm that your mobile device's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections are turned on the easy 72b should be plugged into Power there is no need for any ethernet connection once you are logged into the easy device app go to the top right and click on the plus button the add device window will appear we'll select the easy 72b the next screen will show that the app is scanning for nearby devices after a moment the device should be found by its serial number click the connect button wait for it to connect to the device then we will be prompted to enter the Wi-Fi SS ID and password for the network we want to connect the easy Outlet to click connect when done wait while it establishes a connection to the Wi-Fi network once connected to the Wi-Fi the app will add the device to the cloud service which is what makes it accessible remotely if this ad processed is successful you should see the following note that the setup process is done you can now add another Outlet device or click done to proceed with additional configuration now that our device has been added we see it shows on our device list clicking on it will display the device menu this is where configuration settings are completed let's start with a network page this is where we can change the display name of our device which we'll do now we can also see its IP address information click save at the top right if you've made any changes here the settings page is next this is where we can change the outlet mode from manual to Auto reset manual control requires the user to manually power reset the outlet Auto reset tells the device to monitor the internet connection and automatically reboot power to the outlet when the connection is lost this is the setting we want for the router we will have plugged into the outlet When selecting Auto reset you'll have the option to include the Wi-Fi signal strength if connected if a signal drops below a certain threshold the outlet will reset automatically ping delay is how long the device will wait after a reset before it starts monitoring the connection again default is one minute power on delay is how long the outlet will be powered off for before it turns back on our router does best when powered off for at least 15 seconds adjust yours accordingly number of resets Will default to three times this is generally best for most applications if the first or second Auto reset does not restore connectivity a third will take place if that third reset still fails the connection outage is likely due to another cause the reset only option is for those with a modem or router plug into the outlet this removes the power off option so that users do not accidentally disconnect their internet connection to the device we are going to turn this on last on this page is the Ping interval this is how frequently connection checks are done at the website addresses which are monitored default is 15 seconds we're going to leave this as is click save at the top right when done back at the main menu we'll select schedule this is where we can set the outlet to turn on off or reset at a specific day and time start by switching the first schedule to on then click on it to open the configuration click on the action options are either off reset or on we'll set ours to reset so that it just turns the outlet off and back on click done when this selection is completed select the week next and then click a day or days you want the schedule to take place again click done when this is completed lastly select the time in which the schedule should take place when finished click save at the top right we'll go back again to the main menu and select ping address by default there are 10 different website addresses that the device pings to check for connectivity if you instead want to check only one address perhaps an address of a local network device like a camera or access point Enter that here you may also change the mode from ping to http if desired we're going to leave ours at ping again click save if you've made any changes here next up is the time page this is where we set the time zone how frequently time is checked as well as daylight saving time settings I'm going to set my time zone and click done and then I'll turn on the daylight savings setting remember to click save when you're done making changes here last on the menu is the information page this tells us the serial number of the device the model and its firmware version that sums up our first time configuration of the easy 72b we hope you enjoyed this video please subscribe for more videos

{"id": "pPqsNFi94l4", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "o_zvJJd6HbkynF6F2n9Css09hh8", "transcript": "Wireless   mesh connections should only be used if you \ncannot run an Ethernet cable between the   Peplink router and access point. Ethernet \nis the recommended connection method for   access points as it will always be faster due to \nwireless being more prone to interference issues. Before you start the configuration, \nwe recommend making sure the firmware   is up to date on the router and any \naccess points you will be connecting. In our example, we’re using a Peplink Balance 20 \nX and 2 AP One AC Mini access points. However,   this can be accomplished with any \nPeplink router that supports the AP   Controller function and any Peplink access point. Log into your Peplink router and \nnavigate to the AP tab. It will   default to the wireless S S ID page. Click \non mesh, or wireless mesh on the left. Click the Add button. Start by giving your Mesh network \na name, or “ID” to identify it. The Mesh connection will only be \nestablished over one frequency.   We recommend using 5 gigahertz since \nit’s faster and it will help to avoid   more interference issues that occur \nover the 2.4 gigahertz frequency. Enter a shared key for the access points to \nuse to communicate with each other and help   secure the connections. You can uncheck \nthe hide characters button if needed. Click save when done, but \nwait to apply the changes. Now, navigate over to the settings tab. You \nshould have a default profile listed here, and   possibly custom ones as well. Select the profile \nyou’d like to apply the mesh configuration to. Refer to “mesh” here and select \nthe mesh ID you just created. Click save at the bottom, then apply changes \nat the top right. This will now push the   configuration to your access points. Note \nthat this process could take about 10 to 30   minutes. During this time, keep the access points \nplugged into power and Ethernet to the router. After waiting at least 10 minutes, you \nmay disconnect power and Ethernet from   the router and move it where necessary. \nOnce you power the access point back on,   wait for it to boot back up. In most cases, \nthe access point will show a green status LED,   followed by a flashing or solid green WiFi LED. Wait another 5 to 10 minutes to give the access \npoints time to establish their mesh connection. At this time, you’ll want to log \nback into the router’s web admin   page to confirm everything is set up correctly. Navigate to the AP tab again and \nclick “access point” on the left.   Your access points should be listed \nhere, as you can see both of ours. Additionally, we can go to the mesh slash \nW D S page on the left to check further. See the graph here showing the \nmain router with the two access   points connected wirelessly. This \nis represented by a dotted line. That’s all there is to it. Should you \nrun into any issues, try reconnecting the   Ethernet and give the access points more time \nto synchronize with the mesh configuration. Thank you for watching.

default name of peplink with the last four characters of the serial number after it the default password will be listed on the bottom as AP password now that we're connected to the network we'll open a web browser to access its Administration page for configuration in the address bar we'll enter the default IP address of 192.168.1.1 since the router is redirecting to https it gives us this alert that our connection is not private this is normal as the admin page is not accessible on the internet and therefore there is no security certificate to verify to proceed we'll click Advanced then use this link below log in with the default username and password which are both admin all lowercase letters with the default firmware you will be prompted to change the password immediately enter the current password of admin then enter a new unique password note that this must be at least 10 characters long upper and lower case letters as well as numbers click save and apply to continue you should then see a confirmation that the password has changed click ok after another moment the dashboard page of the web admin will load this is where you can see the status of your connections details about the Lan and Wi-Fi as well as details about the router wait for a moment and we should see the wired internet connection or wind establish a connection and turn green by the status The Cellular Connection may take a little longer to establish as it partly depends on how strong your signal is in our case we have a custom access point name that is likely not being obtained automatically this will prevent the cellular from ever connecting so it will head over to the network tab to adjust that click on cellular from here to access its settings in the window that opens scroll down to the cellular settings section and find the operator settings field we'll change this from Auto to custom and enter in our custom APN in the field below if you need to apply a custom setting here but you're not sure what your APN is check out our other video for more information click save and apply at the bottom of the window when you're done now that the APN is applied we'll go back to the dashboard and see if it will establish a connection there we go it says standby because we're using it as a backup connection and a priority to connection this means is ready to be used when the primary win fails if you'd like to change the Wi-Fi settings go to the AP tab click on the default or SSID name from here and this window will open change the name here first then scroll down to security settings and change the password you can uncheck the High characters button to see what's entered keep in mind that your new password should be between 8 and 63 characters click the save button at the bottom of the page then apply changes at the top right note that if you are currently connected to the default Wi-Fi you will be disconnected wait about a minute for the changes to update and then reconnect using your new Wi-Fi name and password next we'll run a firmware check and make sure that's up to date click on system then firmware on the left as long as your router has an internet connection you can click the check for firmware button and wait for the system to report back just like that it is found the new version we can now click the download upgrade button to continue you'll be advised to download a copy of the configuration while operating firmware should not erase your settings it's always a good idea in case something goes wrong simply click the download link here and wait for the dot co-f file to download and save click OK when the configuration is saved you should then see upgrade status as shown here followed by a progress bar showing the percentage of the upgrade that is completed we'll wait for this to reach 90 and then the router will reboot the LEDs will go dark and the status LED will turn red the firmware and reboot will be complete once you see that the status and Wi-Fi LEDs have turned green again at that time if you are connecting via Wi-Fi you may need to reconnect again otherwise you will be taken back to the loving

Its dimensions are 20 inches tall by 12 inches wide, and 3.4 inches thick. We have an installation guide on top. A few\npages long, and covering all you need to know for mounting the antenna and using it with\nyour cellular device. There’s 2 smaller boxes on the side. In\nthe first one we have this mounting hardware for attaching to a pole. I see it can swivel\nfrom side to side in case you need to adjust the antenna’s direction a bit. And then there’s some washers and screws\nfor that piece. I’ll try and grab the second box here, but\nit looks like I’ll need to move the antenna first. Here’s how it looks sitting up. A closer look at the bottom where the 4 cables\nattach. And the backside where the mounts attach. Finally, we have our 4 cables here. These\nare low-loss, double-shielded C S 29, 16 foot cables, but this model is also available with\nshort pigtails so you can choose your own length of cable. All cables are meant for cellular connections\nand are labeled as such. If we take a closer look, we’ll see each one is labeled with\n4G and 5G as well as letters, A through D so that you know where to connect each one\non your cellular modem. The connections on the ends are S M A male, which is meant for\ndirectly connecting to devices with S M A female ports. Last up, we have the other small box. This\nincludes more mounting hardware for attaching to a wall. Here’s a closer look at those.\nAlong with the washers and screws. That’s it for the Panorama directional antenna,\nmodel W M M 4G.

{"id": "oskcJUh34VY", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "ZkSAOjRhOnsRNiT2RGQTQJ-ikXI", "transcript": "this video will show how peplink and peckwave speed fusion tunnels can be created we're going to demonstrate for you how to create basic tunnel we'll show how easy it is to add bonding then we're going to show some troubleshooting steps that you can take when things aren't working as expected and lastly we'll show how the logs and status screens can help with this troubleshooting in order to do this i've created a simple lab environment which will allow us to easily show how this works we have a fusion hub running on vmware which is able to get out to the internet via an automatic firewall then there's a pepwave hd4mbx which will be given a single 35 meg wan connection and is directly rootable to the fusion hub due to them being on the same layer 2 network we'll create a tunnel between the fusion hub and the mbx in the first instance moving on from that we'll add a second 35 meg connection to show how easy it is to bring bonding to the solution finally we will add a cellular connection to the device this will mean that the tunnel has to be connected to the fusion hub via the firewall and we will talk about the steps that are required to make that work so these are the two devices that are going to be used for demonstration on the left is the fusion hub and on the right is the mbx the fusion hub is going to be used as the head-end device and connected to by the mbx to create the tunnel we'll start by going to the speed fusion page on each device we'll create a new profile on each for the fusion hub we'll give it a name and the remote id the remote id is the local id of the mbx we could add an additional password here but for this demo we will leave it blank on the mbx we will also add a name and the remote id which is the local id of the fusion hub we will also need to set the remote ip which is the fusionhubswan ip address at this point make sure to apply all the changes if the settings are correct the tomo will establish itself on the dashboard you'll see that the tunnel status becomes visible on each device clicking on the status button next to the speed fusion tunnel will show further details and allow you to see the connection status within the tunnel on the left screen we're now going to show the dashboard of the mbx we'll add the second wan connection to the mbx once the cable is connected to the mbx it will begin testing the wand to confirm that it is working using the health check after this is complete the connection is marked as being up the speed fusion tunnel will then test the connection to make sure it's capable of being used in the tunnel if it is it will then add the connection to the tunnel its status will be shown in the right hand screen on this data screen clicking the greater than button takes you to the pep vpn test tool where you can perform speed tests to see the lan status and the remote lan status within the tunnel you can turn off each of the wands within the tunnel temporarily to relay how the tunnel will perform if a certain connection gets disconnected as you can see in this test the two links give a combined upload speed of around 62 meg per second when bonded and 32 meg per second each the ability to disable the wan connections in the screen is temporary and they will automatically reconnect after 15 minutes if you forget to re-enable them at the same time the test will affect the tunnel performance for any users that are using the connection so care is advised when using this tool we have now inserted a sim card into the mba ex cellular port 1 and while that establishes we'll show you a feature which was added to firmware 8. it allows you to do a point-to-point speed test between two peplink devices this is called the wan analyzer and can be found under the system tab on each device we will tell one device to be the server and then configure the other device to be a client the tool can be really useful for confirming the connection speeds that you are seeing in the speed fusion tunnel as the advertised speed of the wan is rarely achievable due to factors such as latency distance and isp congestion you're able to test the various connections in any combinations that you choose and then easily see the amount of bandwidth that is available between the two devices returning to the dashboard of each device we can now see that the cellular connection is active on the mbx visiting the speedfusion status screen shows that a connection isn't added to the tunnel and that it isn't able to use the connection to send or receive data this is shown in the cellular wand link status the reason for this is that it doesn't know a route to get to the fusion hub due to only knowing the private ip address of the fusion hub wand the firewall also needs ports forwarded to the fusion hub to work as the default ports are currently in use we have configured custom ports on the firewall which are forwarded on the fusion hub on the fusion hub we'll also set the receiving handshake port for all the speed fusion tunnels by setting it here and saving it using the save button directly below then for the profile we'll set the custom data port for the tunnel on the fusion hub side we'll save and apply those settings on the mbx we will then add the remote handshake port to the pep vpn profile and add the external ip on this side the data port can be left to fault as well as the receiving handshake as both these will be inbound to the fusion hub say can apply these settings and then we will wait for the tunnel to reestablish you can click to show all profiles to actually see tunnels that aren't connected if the settings are correct then the cellular connection will be used for the tunnel we can see that status updating now running the pep vpn test on this will also show that traffic is passing over the cellular connection along with the other wan connections now we would like to show you what happens when the settings are incorrect and what messages and status screens will show you to help find the course of an issue we will start by setting an incorrect remote id on the mbx this caused the tunnel to be stuck in starting checking the event law reveals the following message which states the remote id or pre-shared key is incorrect nothing is shown on the fusion hub side we'll then correct the remote id and set an incorrect data port again the tunnel gets stuck in starting although you often see the device authenticate and then start creating the tunnel only to fail and cycle through it again the event log will show you that the device failed to connect to the remote peer if the settings were correct on the peplink device this is

{"id": "dwVPNSf_wTI", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "h5972aJvnMmt0WupnpSO1KYY44s", "transcript": "today we're talking about wand quality reports and how to view them through and control 2. when quality reports are done at the device level we're going to take a closer look using this balance 1350. go to the reports tab and select wan quality reports wan quality reports track every active wan on any given router whether it's an ethernet connection or an ltd connection it tracks quality metrics for those whens and rolls all that information up to in control 2. so for this particular router it only has one ethernet wand and this is on a cable modem connection as you see we selected the date and it's chosen when one by default it's going to show you 30 minutes of time initially in that time i've got about 30 to 40 milliseconds of latency and it looks pretty stable we can widen the view out click on all and now you can see something happen right around 5 am the latency wasn't terrible before but it's certainly higher in the 40 to 60 millisecond range sometime right around 5 am then things kind of smooth out and level off right around 30 milliseconds i also see we get a couple big spikes around 30 to 50 millisecond latency which is really no big deal however this is a great place to start troubleshooting when you hear issues of voice quality or slow bandwidth speeds just begin by drilling down into the individual wan connections for that router and take a closer look maybe there are large latency spikes and lots of different activity tracked so these are good places to dig for data or clues to figure out what might be causing your issue and if you were seeing low quality performance on particular wans that's where you can start looking at speed fusion as a way to help work around some of those issues moving back to our ethernet wan reports there's not a lot of data to look necessarily it's definitely very useful but pretty simple and straightforward if we have a cellular based connection we can start to see a lot more information show up for this particular unit i'm going to go to a day that i know this was moving around so here we can see a much more complicated graph there's a lot more data on the graph showing up here such as the carrier the lte band that is being used and then you can see the different signal metrics like rsrq and sinr you can also download this information just click on this download and it downloads as a csv file it's coming up to almost a meg of data so there's lots of data points we'll convert this to a google sheet so you can read it a little easier there's tons of data that we're grabbing with respect to the cellular connection quality over time so you're getting all kinds of data points you get the latency all the relevant signal metrics the location and timestamp this raw data can be turned into some other sort of report or imported into some other system if needed again we can switch to different ones i'm going to go to a different carrier cellular 3 is a verizon connection like with a previous connection you've got all this data mapped out over time you can see different events at the top when down wand up so if you lose a connection it goes offline online that's when the router is booting up or shutting down you've got lots of nice flags here to show you different events now looking at a graph of cellular signal data can get boring fast so what i think is the more useful perspective is the map view like i said on this day the unit was moving in for a considerable amount of time you can see that all those readings kind of smooth out over the course of that trip and so in general this is pretty good connectivity if we click on any one of these dots you can see that it's made up of individual records click on any one of them to see the details it will show you specific readings as you can see there's a couple in there that aren't that great but in total they average out pretty good now if we want to zoom in you can see those individual dots in a more granular fashion you can start to zero on where your coverage issues might be or your signal quality issues might exist we can see this is where the quality starts to degrade so get some clues from the larger view but then as you drill down you can really start to break out where those trouble spots might be that's horizon let's switch carriers again and just see what the map view looks like for a couple other carriers this one is t-mobile once again there's mostly good coverage on this route but there's a couple spots that look a little more glaring than verizon's did all in all pretty isolated stuff now we can use these tools up here to start drilling in and looking for more specific issues or different metrics i'll take away the strength and the quality so we can look at just the latency if we look at latency less than 500 milliseconds that's good performance in general if we look at over 500 milliseconds there's where we can see the user is actually experiencing impact of their traffic in all of these areas the latency metric recorded higher than 500 millisecond so that's where you're going to start to see the performance really degrade for you now you can change that threshold if you want if 500 isn't the right perspective let's turn it up to over a thousand milliseconds these are getting to be pretty terrible in terms of user experience you can start to really zero in on particular areas where you're getting a bad user experience and so in this case you can see the strength is very poor the quality is very poor and the latency is very poor for strength to begin with antennas are about the only thing you can do to really improve that so that's not necessarily a carrier fault or carrier issue it might just mean you don't have enough antenna to really make the connection work well in that location now in this location you can see signal strength is very good the quality is very good but the latency is really high so this is more of a carrier side issue it doesn't look like there's much you do to fix this issue but again i'm putting in a couple data points and clicking on a few circles and i know a lot about the user experience and what the sources of those problems might be with only about five to ten minutes of research here there's all kinds of powerful things you can do with this data at your fingertips now let's go back and filter by signal strength like i mentioned earlier there's things that you can influence and there's things that are kind of out of your control signal strength to a point you have some control over that again you can find better antennas you can reduce the cabling in between your router and the antenna you can do things to influence the signal strength you can't put new towers up but you can optimize the signal within whatever towers they have available here you can see there's several areas when the signal strength has hit our threshold of very poor so again this would be a good way to show that it might be worth spending some time and money on getting a better antenna set up with the device again you've got lots of data points that you can manipulate here to get the exact perspective that you're looking to troubleshoot that's all there is to wan quality reports we hope you've enjoyed this video if you're looking

{"id": "_u4duoww4sw", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "_80WmtPYAFaMo4-UYSegEZTVhTg", "transcript": "the pepwave max br1 mini has been one of our most popular cellular solutions of course there are many variables surrounding the cellular network and what is required to make a connection we came up with a guide to help combat some common issues that users encounter the first thing you may notice is that you connect to the pep wave either via wi-fi or ethernet and find you have no connection to the internet take a look at the cellular led on your device and it may be dark or flashing green if the led is dark it means your sim card is not being detected the led will start flashing once it is detected and stabilized once the connection is established the best place to start troubleshooting is with the sim card the sim card should be a standard size for hardware revision one and two models or a nano size for hardware revision three as shown here sims should be inserted with the gold contacts face down and with a notched side inserted first for slot a slot b will be the reverse where the gold contacts are face up also ensure that the sim has been activated with the carrier using the imei number this allows the carrier to supply you with a compatible sim card and data plan from the manufacturer the br1 mini includes two powell style antennas for each cellular antenna port they should be screwed onto the port's finger tight as shown here you'll also want to confirm you have the device in good signal location if you're not using the included antennas test them to compare if you're using included antennas try swapping them out with outdoor antennas or with ones you know work with another modem lastly if possible move the device to a completely different location this can help to rule out a location specific issue connect an ethernet cable from your computer either even at port on the pep wave or look for the wi-fi network name on your computer unless you've changed it this will be called pepwave with the last four characters of its mac address after it when prompted for the password or pre-shared key enter the ap password from the bottom label on the router next open a web browser on the computer and go to 192.168.50.1 you should see a page that looks like this enter your username and password which are both admin by default assuming you are successful with logging into the pet wave take a closer look at the wan connection status at the dashboard tab first we might see the status no sim detected this could be because the sim is not inserted or is not inserted correctly we may also see the status resetting which could just mean the system is refreshing and trying to detect the sim card if the wan connection status gets stuck at connecting or obtaining ip address we'll want to check for signal information under the details button refer to where it says band at the bottom of the first section here look to the right for how to interpret the values shown next we'll need to check for the apn which stands for access point name if this is missing or incorrect the cellular will never connect look under the cellular details cellular settings section if needed change the operator's settings from auto to custom and then manually enter the apn in the field below you may also adjust the mt to see if that helps for a tnt is best to use 1360. for verizon we're using 1428 and t-mobile we'll generally use the same remember to click save and apply after making any changes back at the dashboard we'll wait and see that the cellular establishes a connection if it does it should show its connection in signal strength in bars depending on the priority you may see the status as standby instead this means the connection is ready for when the primary connection is lost also at the dashboard tab refer to the section device information check that the firmware version is current if the firmware is not current go to the system firmware page to upgrade if the router is connected to a wam source you can simply check for a new firmware version and wait for the system to find it then click download and upgrade if you do not have any alternative wan connection you can proceed with a manual upgrade in which case you need to open a new tab and go to peplink's website to download the firmware file if a firmware is current please check the cellular module firmware next note that this will require an active ethernet or wi-fi wan connection on the pep wave while logged into the pep wave navigate to the url and find index change this to support and refer to the cellular module firmware update click check for update after a moment the page will display the latest and current firmware versions if these do not match select the cellular

that was being used in this device be tested in another br1 or other cellular modem what were the results this can help narrow down if the issue is related to the sim card or the pep wave router if after this troubleshooting you still cannot resolve your connection issue you can log into the web admin page successfully go to the status device page and download a diagnostic report ideally this should be obtained while the issue is occurring or after the occurrence but also before a power cycle or reboot as this will cause the data to be lost then send it to support 5gstore.com with details

external antenna but that there is enough available signal to increase network performance even the best outdoor antenna or amplifier kit can only increase your signal if there is a signal available to draw in on the other hand if your signal is already strong a signal booster might not provide enough benefit to be cost effective while this is mainly done for fixed applications such as at your home or business you may also do this if you're traveling and planning to stay in the same location for an extended period there are tools made specifically for testing signal strength but unless you need an easy way to test multiple carrier signals a cell phone or cellular modem is typically sufficient cell phones will of course be limited to only the carrier they are linked to though if you have a cellular modem like a pep wave cradle point or sierra wireless device you can test any carrier for which you have an active sim card before you get started it's important you understand the data you're looking for rssi received signal strength indicator an rsrp reference signal received power are both values that measure signal strength our srp is what you want to refer to for lte and 5g signals these signal values will be represented as a negative number the closer this number is to 0 the stronger the signal strength rsrq receives signal received quality an sinr signal to noise ratio is what you'll want to refer to for the signal quality of lte and 5g connections notice the center value is the only value that is a positive number not all modems will list this value each of these values varies for different technologies and carriers as they depend on the particular abilities of the modem essentially how well it can extract signal the values shown in the charts here are what we typically reference we cannot guarantee a particular signal or improved performance regardless of the signal strength and quality this is because of the many factors which affect signal values things like distance to the cell tower power load barriers such as mountains buildings trains etc competing signals signal from a cellular booster and weather unfortunately there is no clear cut answer to what constitutes a successful connection it is possible to disconnect with excellent as well as poor values you have to take both signal strength and signal quality into account you could have an excellent signal but disconnect because of poor quality and vice versa you may also stay connected because of good signal but have poor bandwidth speeds because of poor signal quality the variance of a signal is a significant factor in the success of a connection measurements of signal strength and signal quality for a specific moment do not reflect on the stability of a connection as these values will vary as conditions change some factors like cell tower load can't even be measured you can only gain some idea as to whether or not tower load affects your connection by testing at different times of day this allows you to find averages but also helps to confirm if you'll see any improvement when the tower is at full load we understand that finding our srp and rsrq on a cell phone could be a bit tricky compared to cellular modems and routers some phones will only list rsrp in the event you cannot locate these specific values from your cellular device doing a site survey using the signal bars as a reference is fine at a minimum the signal bars will give you some data to compare with it's also best if you can perform speed tests in multiple points at the location this can help determine if bandwidth performance improves especially when you're not seeing a change in signal bars to perform the site survey try to answer the following as best you can one is the rsrp indoors at the location you use your device at that location what are your speeds you can use a site like speedthis.net to check your download and upload speeds what is the best rsrp you could find immediately outside and around the building at that location outside what are your speed test results if the signal outside the building is not significantly better than it's inside walk or drive in the direction of better signal until you find significantly better signal at that location what are your speed disc results what's between you and that optimal signal trees elevation how far away is it the last part of our video is going to show how to find rsrp on a number of common cell phones if your phone is not listed here or the instructions provided do not work we recommend calling your cell phone provider for more information or searching user forums it's possible someone else may have already had this question answered you'll find instructions for the apple iphone samsung google blackberry

cellular modem or router some of the frequencies 5g is operating on don't offer much range from the cell tower an antenna could ensure you pull in as much signal as possible no matter where you set up your network today we'll review a few of our new 5g capable antennas and show you how they can be utilized as you can see in our sample city here there's solutions for home users businesses and vehicles whether you're a first responder or traveling in your rv or boat there's even a portable antenna for those of you wanting to take your connection to the beach let's start with a couple building mount antennas that are popular for home use the surecall ultra wide band omni and directional antennas the surecall omni and directional yogi antennas have a more limited frequency range than our other 5g antennas they both cover 600 to 2700 megahertz which will include band 71. the size and antenna gain are where these two differ the omni provides between 1.5 to 4 db imax gain while the augie which works best when you have a clear line of sight to the cell tower provides 7 to 9 dbi gain next we have another building mount antenna that is a directional panel type the panorama indoor outdoor mino 4g 5g directional antenna this is available with two by two or four by four memo connections with low loss double shielded cables it supports a high gain across a frequency range of six hundred to six thousand megahertz and with an ip66 rating and operating temps as low as negative 40 and as high as 176 degrees fahrenheit it makes it flexible for any environment similar to the previous antenna is another directional panel style solution made by pointing this antenna uses their new advanced metamaterial technology this makes use of artificial magnetic conductors which allows it to achieve exceptional bandwidth and gain as a 2x 2 memo you have two cross-polarized antennas in one ip65 enclosure the frequency range is somewhat limited but does extend to include band 71 along with frequencies up to 3 800 megahertz closing up our building mount antennas is this dual directional yagi antenna kit the mobilemark wide band log periodic memo antenna kit like other yogi style antennas this will work best with line of sight to the cell tower note the manner in which the antennas are positioned on an angle you can set up other yagi antennas such as the sure call we addressed earlier in a similar manner or even stacked on a pole mounted vertically as you can see from the features this is by far the highest gain antenna available for the lower frequency bands moving on to vehicle applications we're going to start with the popular pointing automotive antenna this is available with just cellular if desired but the one we're highlighting here supports four cables for cellular two for dual band wi-fi and one for gps ruggedized with an ip68 rating and ground plane independent this antenna is suitable for implementation on all surface types as with most omnidirectional antennas the gain is on the lower side the following antennas have been a popular choice for first responders though they can certainly be used in anyone's mobile application the panorama dome and maco dome antennas are quite similar as you can see note the differences however in the antenna gain the standard dome antenna is slightly higher than the mako though each is significantly higher gain than most of our omni solutions both options come in white or black along with options for cellular connections only as well as a combination of cellular wi-fi and gps for marine applications you may look to these next mimo antennas the pointing omni 402 has dual connections and an ip68 rating it's specifically made for marine use as its uv and salt water resistant frequency range is similar to the pointing panel antenna we saw earlier gain is higher than some others but still comes in low on your 400 to 600 megahertz range with a durable ip67 rated enclosure and uv stable housing the pepwave puma 401 is a comparable choice it can be panel mounted or pole mounted with the included bracket it's truly flexible in terms of application so much that it can also be used as a building mount antenna for small businesses atms or kiosks you might look to these next two antennas from panorama one bracket mount and one magnetic mount solution both are omnidirectional and similar in frequency range size and operating temperature the bracket mount option has a peak gain of 5 dbi and requires no ground plane the magnetic mount comes with a lower gain and should be seated on a metal surface this is what will serve as its ground plane the last antenna will review is the most portable antenna of any solution you can take it with you wherever you go the panorama desk mount antenna is a simple solution that can be propped up on your desk or suction cup to a window or other slick surface you've got an ultra wide range of frequency band support with a two times two connection and a peak gain of five decibels it's not rated for outdoor use but note the high and low operating temperature and be sure to only use it when the weather is appropriate we hope this video has provided you with a better understanding of the 5g solutions available our team encourages you to reach out to us for more information you can also find links to each of the solutions we covered here in the description below thanks for watching", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2021-06-02T14:24:27Z", "channelId": "UCPfPFshSC-rH4IbaClXrWSQ", "title": "5G Antenna Solutions

switch otherwise known as the uis-622b if you're not already familiar with this device and how it works check out our earlier video where we compare it to the single outlet switch first leave the power to your devices as they are in our case a modem and router connect an ethernet cable into the switch and into a lan port on your router plug the switch into power next as your switch boots up the led will flash on in and off give it a few moments and the lights will stop if your internet connection is operating correctly the internet led will illuminate green adding the switch to the cloud for uis network will be the simplest method of setup this is done at the website or through the mobile application called easy device we're going to show you the process via the website if you do not have an account set up you will need to complete that first once you enter your email and create a password you will receive an email to verify your account which completes the setup if you're using the app log in and look for add at the top right through the website click on the button at the top right with the three dots select the outlet with a plus sign the cloud network begins searching and if needed you can click the arrow button to have it refresh the search and start again if you're connected to the same network as the switch when you do this it should automatically find the device if not you may add it manually by the serial number you will be prompted to disconnect the ethernet lan cable for a second and plug it back in this ensures the switch is ready for add mode continue through the steps using the information labeled on the bottom of the switch click done when the steps show completion at this time the cloud link illuminates to proceed with configuration or view the switch details click on the switch icon in the device menu the m signifies the switch is currently in manual mode if you're someone that needs to control power to a local network connection at random times such as an ethernet switch or wi-fi access point this may be for you you can also verify the outlet mode by noting the status of the uas button watch as we click the m button on the cloud the uis turns on blue and you can see the icon changes from m to a representing auto reset mode for some users the default configuration may be sufficient let's take a look over the menu and see how we can configure this for a modem and router first is network here we can adjust the device name and make it something more identifiable you can also disable dhcp and enter a manual address subnet mask and gateway auto dns mode is disabled by default and filled in with these servers you may enter custom server addresses or simply enable this so it can grab the dns from your network lastly the http port can be changed from the default port 80. most users should keep this at the default click save when you're done and wait for the circle at the top right here to stop spinning website is next this is where you can edit the default ip addresses which the switch is using to monitor internet connectivity note the column on the left that reads both or none this can be set to an individual outlet if you only need one outlet to reset based on a lost connection note that you cannot set a single outlet and both simultaneously as you can see here just below each website you'll see udp this is the protocol in which the switch uses to check the connection typically udp will work for all users if you prefer using alternate websites you may adjust accordingly after the fourth default address your network's gateway address should be listed and set to none while none means this site will not be used it's available for users who need to monitor their router's network connection rather than their internet connection or in addition to once more click save at the top when you're done settings this is the most important to users as it is what controls the timing intervals and what's needed to trigger a reset first note the top where it says outlet number one and outlet number 2. if we toggle over to number 2 you'll see the settings match with the exception of the name and power on delay go back to outlet 1 and change the name if you desire next is the reset only setting because we are controlling our internet connection via our modem and router we want to enable this setting with reset only disabled you have the ability to power the outlet on or off enabling this simply takes away the risk of us accidentally powering our internet connection off therefore dropping our link to the switch power on delay is important here as we want to make sure our modem boots down completely before powering it back on this may differ in your case but we're entering 20 seconds under timeout settings the first three will stay at default though you might increase these if you're on a limited data plan ping delay is configured in minutes and we want to enter an approximate time in which it will take our modem and router to reboot and establish an internet connection keep in mind that the power on delays you configure for both outlets uis reset refers to the number of times the switch will continue to reset if after the first attempt the connection has not been established if this is at a remote location you might consider increasing this value lastly we have the force us reset option this helps if the switch loses power when it boots up it will follow the same power on delays to the outlets to ensure your equipment boots up properly before we save we're going to adjust the first few settings for our second outlet the name enable reset only and set our power on delay for 90 seconds this is because our modem needs time to boot up and connect before our router now we'll save all our changes if you decide to set a schedule you may do so here up to 20 can be configured don't forget to also adjust the time settings accordingly finally our setup is complete though we still have one more step that is to simulate an outage and verify our switches performing correctly let's monitor our switch now to see what happens we're going to disconnect the ethernet cable that connects the modem to the router this will cause the internet to disconnect once at least one website fails to respond to consecutive pings the internet light starts blinking the cloud link will also start blinking after all sites fail to respond both lights will go dark and the outlets turn off we'll now wait 20 seconds for outlet 1 to come back on after another 70 seconds outlet two powers on at this point we'll reconnect the ethernet cable from our modem to our router a few moments later and we can see the internet and cloud link lights have turned on again indicating our internet service is working again since we have our ping delay set to four minutes we'll continue to monitor the switch and ensure that it does not reset again", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2021-05-04T16:47:38Z",

{"id": "GGvjSPua7rw", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "30JetEE2VO7FUohHEcqpnqN2vIc", "transcript": "today we'll be comparing our five g store remote power switches the two outlet model with a north american plug the uis-622b and the single outlet model also with a north american plug the ez62b also called the ez outlet 3. first let's address some common features these units share each model can detect a loss of internet connectivity and trigger the outlet or outlets to power cycle this is done automatically by a process of monitoring a group of website addresses users have the option of manual control as well this can be for a network device connected to your router that fails frequently but you can also plug in literally any device as long as it does not exceed the switch's power limitations whether you're using the automatic reset or manual control all users have access to monitor and control their switches through the manufacturer's cloud management website they also offer a free mobile application easy device download this for free at the apple app store and the google play store both models use a 10 to 100 megabit per second ethernet port for connecting to your local network while each has a replaceable fuse only the ez62b comes with a backup installed on the bottom taking a closer look at the single outlet model it's perfect for those needing a solution that can easily fit anywhere users that need to power cycle multiple devices but do not require a time delay in between can plug in up to 10 amps of power other than the most common use being for modems and routers users might install this to control local network devices or use it as a means to prevent network devices from going into a sleep or dormancy mode and of course it can also be used as an alternative to your simple home timer schedule lights or anything else to turn on and off as needed just remember power to the single outlet must not exceed 10 amps moving on to the dual outlet model uis 622b we'll see that it's a slightly larger footprint power is the same as the single outlet model but the outlets each can only support a max of 5 amps use case examples are very much the same but due to its advanced configuration options it's also a helpful troubleshooting tool now let's dig in and review basic use with the ez62b this product is perfect for those searching out a plug and play solution because of its function button use this to toggle between auto reset and manual control modes or for toddling power to the outlet if additional configuration is needed such as adjusting the ping or power on delay this can be done through the partner cloud application or website for the advanced user the ez outlet has a web user interface that you can secure if desired while this gives you everything you can access through the cloud management it's the only location where you can backup a configuration and also where you would upload one this allows businesses higher productivity when configuring multiple units with the same settings we also want to point out the ip address setting as unlike the dual outlet we'll review next only allows for one customizable address although by default it uses a preset selection of 10 addresses from the factory it's a similar situation with the dual outlet model whether you're using one or both outlets the cloud service is enabled automatically you just need to connect the switch to the internet and add it to the cloud the uis button is also similar to the easy outlets function button this is used for enabling or disabling the automatic reset mode when uis is disabled only manual control or schedules will trigger the outlet status to change for the advanced user the dual outlet can be more beneficial even when your application only requires one outlet most notably to it professionals is the addition of an event log this makes it a more attractive solution for tracking and troubleshooting purposes where the easy outlet can only configure one customizable website or ip address the dual model can support up to seven with two outlets you also have additional options for controlling the outlets together or individually users may also set schedules up to 20 which is considerably more than the six the easy outlet is limited to there's a few more differences to point out with the dual outlet model these are things that are found only on the uis 620 db first there's the http command api this allows users to control their ip switch using http as commands in a web browser this can work while on the local network or while you were remote just keep in mind that remote access is required to your network as we previously addressed the dual outlet can support up to seven addresses to monitor internet and or network service in comparison the easy outlet will use 10 however the difference is these 10 sites are not configurable by the user instead the easy outlet is restricted to one custom ip or network address more on the event log can be seen here on the right view the status of the outlets which includes auto or scheduled along with on off or reset review notifications regarding email tests or errors with configuration several different email servers are supported and users can control which events they are notified about if you prefer an alternative to the manufacturer's cloud service refer to google hangouts and skype these provide a simplified approach as they don't include any configuration management or an event log both hangouts and skype act as instant messaging applications in this case think of each switch as a person you're chatting with send them an instruction such as resetting power to outlet 2 and it will reply when the task has been completed lastly we have two unique configuration options the first will typically apply to users that are installing at a location with power fluctuations enable the force uis reset after initial power and once it receives power it will trigger the outlet or outlets to reset second is the detect unplugged lan cable we find this is most helpful to those installing in an office setting it's easy to make the mistake of knocking a cable off its connection to troubleshoot this simply we can check this without having to physically touch or see the switch now that you've had a chance to review the differences between the uis 622b and the ez62b do you know which one is right for you if not your friends at 5gstore.com are standing by to assist", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2021-04-19T17:34:26Z", "channelId":

single point to point connection from our pepwave max br1 to a fusionhub solo appliance if you have a multiple peer license you'll need to add its serial number to your in control account before this step when you're ready go to the organization settings section and click on warranty and license once here scroll down to the fusion hub licenses section at the bottom of this table of devices you'll find the acquire fusion hub license button when you click this you'll see your multi-appear license along with the solar license we'll select solo then click acquire select a group to add this fusion hub appliance it should be the same group that the other device or devices you'll be connecting to are located click process edit the device name and or the location if needed click add at the bottom when done then click close the system will display the license key and serial number of any fusion hub solo licenses now that ours is created we'll be redirected to the dashboard page of the group we added it to until we create our amazon connection the fusion hub will display an offline status next move back to the warranty and license page under organization settings again refer to the fusion hub licenses section click on the link subscribe to fusion hub on aws marketplace this should open up a new tab or window in your web browser if not make sure your browser is not blocking popups from this page you may be prompted to log into your amazon web services account at this time as you can see at the top right corner we're already logged in the first page will show a review of the amazon connection including a place where you can calculate monthly costs scroll to the top and click the continue to subscribe button review the terms and conditions then click accept terms for the next few moments amazon system will process the subscription we'll see pending displayed here while it's working once you see the effective date the continue to configuration button should illuminate after clicking this button we'll choose a region the other settings should be left as shown the region is the location from which the amazon connection is operating you'll want to select the closest location to where you'll be using your peplin hardware the further the distance between the locations the more latency it can add to the vpn connection when you're done here click the continue to launch button at the top right once you're at the launch the software page refer to choose action and change it to launch through ec2 click the launch button at the bottom right to continue now at step 2 you'll choose an instance type this is a virtual server and options differ based on cpu memory storage and networking capacity all options that are compatible with our account can be selected by checking the box to the left of the name the t3 nano is selected by default we're going to change that's a t3 medium as recommended by peplink choose the best fit for your needs now but with room to grow as this cannot be changed after completion click review and launch at the bottom right to continue the review page is exactly that it's an overview of the instance details while you have the option to adjust settings such as security groups which are like port forwarding rules it is unnecessary after you're done checking your configuration scroll to the bottom right and click launch you'll be prompted to set up a key pair next this is much like a password that can be applied to the instance we're going to skip that by selecting the option to proceed without a key pair we'll acknowledge the selection then click launch instances the page will update and display the steps it takes to complete the connection to the server eventually you'll see a new page that shows the launch status there's some helpful information available here like viewing usage and creating billing alerts we're going to move right ahead to view our instance by clicking the button at the bottom the instance page will show a list of any you have created as you can see here hours shows that it's currently running so we know it has been configured properly we still need to link this to the fusion hub appliance however so let's click on the instance name from here we can copy its public ipv4 address which is going to take us to its administration page this is the same as your peplink or pepwave router's web admin page initially since the page is using https it may alert you that the page is not trusted we're using the google chrome browser but whichever browser you have look for where it might allow you to proceed to the webpage enter admin for the user name all lower case letters for the password we need to move back to the amazon instance page copy its instance id at the top left then move back to the fusion hub login page we'll paste the password here and click login immediately we're prompted with the setup wizard this will provide the fusion hub its basic configuration enter a unique identifier for the fusion hub to use as its local id note that the local id must be between 3 and 14 characters without spaces click next to continue select the desired time zone as this will apply to the fusion hub event log click save and apply settings the final step is to add the license key provided by peplink this is found at the in control 2 page under organization settings and warranty and license click submit to finish the initial setup a verification process occurs next and will take about 30 seconds to complete the fusion hub appliance will then reboot itself after the reboot you'll be redirected to the login page let's go ahead and see what the admin page looks like now we can see our wan ip address from amazon and details about the fusion hub its firmware is out of date so we want to get that upgraded just like a router you can go under the system firmware page here and use the check for firmware option you can also do this from the in control 2 page under the settings tab at the device details page select firmware management select the newest firmware to upgrade to currently that is 8.1.1 we want upgrade immediately rather than schedule it save changes and we'll wait a few minutes for that to complete now that the firmware has been updated let's take a quick look at an alternate login method for the fusion hub at the device details page in control 2 we'll click on the settings tab at the top and select remove web admin a new page opens to the dashboard page of the fusion hub if you prefer to configure speed fusion at the web admin page you'll find this under the network tab speed fusion will be listed on the left you'll notice the local id we configured through the setup wizard earlier just click new profile and you can proceed from there for those instructions check out our other speed fusion videos linked in the description you can also configure through in control 2. keep in mind that configuration can only be done through the web administration or in control 2. you cannot use both simultaneously to begin the in-control configuration start at the group dashboard page where your devices are located go to the top of the page and hover over the pep vpn speed fusion tab select configuration check the enabled box next then scroll to the bottom of the page and click save changes you should see an alert appear at the top left that says saved successfully from this point the configuration is no different than creating a speed fusion connection between two routers for those instructions please check out our speed fusion video for configuring through in control 2. we'll have that listed in the description as well", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2021-04-14T17:11:29Z", "channelId": "UCPfPFshSC-rH4IbaClXrWSQ",

the local web administration pages of the routers unless you are using peplink's speed fusion cloud service you can configure this using the configuration tool on in control 2 instead that is what we are going to show you today if you have not yet created your in control 2 account check out our video on the initial setup if needed before you start make sure the devices you want to link via speedfusionvpn are included in the same group select the group and you'll be taken to a page where it shows a list of the devices hoveroverspeedfusionpepvpn at the top and select configuration this is disabled by default check the enabled box then scroll down to the bottom and click save changes the page should refresh and display a map of where the devices are located scroll down past this map and click add profile before we do that we're just going to delete this previous profile a window will open where we can configure the vpn the first step is to select a topology to use while star and mesh are typically used for multiple peer connections point to point is simply a single peer to peer connection this is what we're using next check the boxes beside each device you want to connect click show advanced settings if you still have a device to add at this time continue to the next step we'll give the vpn a unique name select whether or not to have encryption enabled data port is typically left as is but if you know the speed fusion ports are blocked from your service providers then you'll need to change this link failure detection time is generally left at the default and may be adjusted later if needed this is much like the health check for the vpn when smoothing is disabled by default it can be used to help improve the quality of your voice over ip and video calls this will require more data usage path cost defaults to 10 and is generally left as is max latency difference is the maximum latency at which winds are allowed to be included in the connection any devices that exceed this value are unused until the value lowers click on show advanced settings at the bottom left and you'll see the link settings and when settings appear you can also switch to dynamic weighted bonding to help with balancing your connection with poor or unstable throughput on your wands here's a closer look at advanced link settings first click edit and this is where we find settings like subtunnels a cap for when smoothing forward error correction receive buffer and bandwidth limit here's what we could do by setting a secondary tunnel with wand smoothing enabled and an upload bandwidth limit of 100 megabits per second click save and save again now for advanced wan settings this is where we can adjust the connections to be used in their priorities again we have a box to show advanced settings click on this and you have further control on the connections including the ability to restrict it to upload or download only we also have the option to add a cutoff latency in case your connections have a tendency to increase significantly and if there's frequent times where packet loss is an issue you can set a time in milliseconds for the router to suspend the wan connection after a period of packet loss click save then close add any notes about this connection here if desired then click next now you'll be shown a summary of your profile configuration review and click finish when completed we can see our profile listed here and can edit it as needed a safe successfully alert should be displayed at the top move to the speed fusion tab again and select one of the live status options to monitor the vpn connection for other views take a look at the dashboard page of in control to or log into our router's web administration page we could also move back to the speed fusion tab and select one of the live status pages here's a quick overview of the configuration process again some of you may not have as many steps if advanced configuration is not needed again start by confirming your devices are in the same group within in control next enable the speed fusion configuration select the topology of your vpn then the peer devices you want to connect set

{"id": "qjTPmoHegRE", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "04A2t_9TJd5zvhpsIB_IaZ3B6U4", "transcript": "in this video we're going to walk you through configuring a simple pep vpn connection or in the case your router supports speed fusion a hot failover connection we're using a pepwave max br1 and a pepwave surf soho mk3 these instructions will cover the local web administration though configuration can also be completed through in control 2. like ipsec vpn pep vpn serves as a simple site to site vpn tunnel between two or more pep link or pep wave routers when configured on routers that support the hot failover feature you will see improved failover as well as session persistence on devices you choose to utilize the speed fusion vpn before we begin with any speed fusion configuration we need to confirm our router's lan ip addresses do not conflict with one another all pepwave max br1 routers and surf soho routers default to an ip address of 192.168.50.1 so by default we would have a conflict our first router the max br1 has already been configured to use an address of 10.5.1.1 but let's take a look at how to change the ip address in case you need to log into the web admin of the router and click on network at the top it should default to network settings on the left if not select lan then click on the untagged lan here this is what the default ip address is called after clicking on the name the edit window will appear you can copy our 10.5.1.1 address or enter your own within the private ip range here's another example using 192.168.6 0.1 scroll down to the dhcp section and change the ip range next based on the default range we'll make this 192.168.60 and 192.168.6 0.250 scroll down to click save then click apply changes at the top right if you need to complete this step you will need to refresh your connection to the router after applying the changes first wait approximately 30 seconds after you click apply changes whether you are connected through ethernet cable or through wi-fi disconnect then wait a couple seconds and reconnect this will ensure your computer or other device obtains a new ip address based on your change then you just need to reload the web administration page at the new ip address for simplicity's sake we have the pepwave max br ones web admin page side by side with the surf sohos on both routers we're at the advanced tab for pebbling balance routers speedfusion or pepvpn will be under network as you can see on our devices we have our unique local id already set this page is not always active by default if you find your page looks different than ours and only shows a local id you will first need to save and apply this you can also change it if you prefer but like serial numbers each router must have a unique identifier this is one factor speed fusion relies on for establishing its vpn connection make sure to click save and apply changes when you're done next we have the remote ip addresses or host name section if the sofo is using a public wan ip address we would enter it here if the public ip is dynamic and you're using a dynamic domain name service you would enter the host name in our case the br1 is using a public ip address so we're going to leave this blank for a simple hot failover connection the remaining settings do not need to be changed if needed click on the priority to the right of the wan to adjust it when you're done click save and apply changes moving on to soho click new profile and give it a name confirm encryption is enabled then enter the remote id and pre-shared key for the remote ip section we'll enter the dynamic dns host name from rbr one again we're going to leave the rest of these settings as is then we'll click save and apply changes at this time the router will work on applying the settings and begin the process of establishing the vpn tunnel in this example the br 1 is where we have hot failover refer to the send all traffic to section we have it disabled on the soho and enabled on the br1 click on the little pen icon to the right to edit first select the vpn to send all traffic then apply dns servers when done click save and apply for further control we'll go to the outbound policy page peplink balance users can find this under the network tab note that pep vpn and speed fusion routes have priority over any rules here there's also a feature called expert mode if the user would like certain traffic or devices to go over a certain when to access the internet and not through the tunnel they would need expert mode hours has expert mode enabled though you may have to enable yours by clicking on the blue question mark at the top right currently we've got a sample rule we set for our computer to use the vpn if we need to route outside of the vpn simply click and drag the applicable rules above vpn routes like this let's check back in on the vpn status now okay so we can see it's still working we're going to speed up and you can see it shows established on our br1 the soho is a little behind since we're connected remotely through in control but we want to show you the soho rules the soho does not have outbound policy but you can set outbound rules for the vpn on the configuration page we have another vpn that the soho is following rules for on this home office network we only want our work computer and phone to have failover to our cellular backup you can see that in the rule here notice the algorithm is set to priority we also have this rule set for all other personal devices this one we have the algorithm set to enforced this means the devices will be disconnected if the primary when connection fails for normal configuration be sure to click save then apply changes when adding any rules keep in mind that any devices you are sending over the vpn will need to refresh their connections you may be disconnected temporarily or you may need to refresh the connection as we had shown earlier", "snippet":

{"id": "P4OR9PnoKak", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "6zG3Hfg3D-L4RXptAK0CL6B-csg", "transcript": "you've configured a router before you're a new user you may or may not be familiar with vpn there are multiple types of vpn so we want to take a moment to explain the different types and how they compare first vpn stands for virtual private network and it is a means of connecting devices to each other remotely since the connections over the vpn are private they are generally secure but some vpn types provide more security than others when it comes to vpn connections there are two types the peplink hardware supports one is considered a client-to-site connection and one is considered a site-to-site connection client-to-site means you are connecting a personal device such as your cell phone tablet or laptop to a router at a remote location our personal device is the client and the site or server as it's sometimes referred is our peplink router that being said in the case of a site-to-site vpn connection this is a connection between two or more routers client-to-site vpn connections include l2tp with ipsec pptp and openvpn as an example let's say we're at the local coffee shop connected to their free wi-fi with our laptop if we want to do some online banking securely we can connect to the peplink router at our home using any of these vpn connections however it's important to note that this is only possible if the internet connection at your home has a publicly routable ip address such as a static ip this means it can be accessed from an outside connection provided it has the correct information and credentials to do so once we're connected to the vpn any information that we send and receive through our laptop is going to be encapsulated and transmitted securely from the coffee shop wi-fi through the open internet and back to our pep wave at home this protects us from any potential threats on the coffee shop wi-fi network and it also lets us access local devices on our pep wave such as security cameras or a hard drive all as if we were connected directly to our home network while we take a quick look at the peplink configuration pages we want to make sure this is clear our laptop in this case still requires an internet connection it cannot use the internet connection from your pep wave at home it's simply a means to secure your connection over a public network while simultaneously providing remote access to devices on your home network if needed that brings us to the site to site vpn connections all peplink and pepwave router support pepvpn which is peplink's simple approach to internet protocol security vpn or ipsec vpn for short most hardware also supports ipsec this does not include wi-fi access points the surf soho mk3 or outdoor rated hardware just like with client-to-site vpns site-to-site vpn connections will require a static or public internet ip address on at least one of the routers here's a preview of each site to cite vpn ipsec is up first site-to-site connections are typically made for sharing access to devices and files across each network ipsec is a common vpn protocol used by several router manufacturers on your peplink or pepwave router ipsec can be used to connect to another peplink or pepwave router as well as cisco and juniper routers though when you're using all peplink and pepwave

to each other remotely since the connections over the vpn are private they are generally secure but some vpn types provide more security than others when it comes to vpn connections there are two types the pep link hardware supports one is considered a client-to-site connection and one is considered as site-to-site connection client-to-site means you are connecting a personal device such as your cell phone tablet or laptop to a router at a remote location our personal device is the client and the site or server as it's sometimes referred is our peplink router that being said in the case of a site-to-site vpn connection this is a connection between two or more routers client-to-site vpn connections include l2tp with ipsec pptp and openvpn as an example let's say we're at the local coffee shop connected to their free wi-fi with our laptop if we want to do some online banking securely we can connect to the peplink router at our home using any of these vpn connections however it's important to note that this is only possible if the internet connection at your home has a publicly routable ip address such as a static ip this means it can be accessed from an outside connection provided it has the correct information and credentials to do so once we're connected to the vpn any information that we send and receive through our laptop is going to be encapsulated and transmitted securely from the coffee shop wi-fi through the open internet and back to our pep wave at home this protects us from any potential threats on the coffee shop wi-fi network and it also lets us access local devices on our pep wave such as security cameras or a hard drive all as if we were connected directly to our home network while we take a quick look at the peplink configuration pages we want to

mk3 after connecting to the soho with ethernet cable or wirelessly you can access this at 192.168.50.1 once you're there you'll log in with the default username and password both of these are admin all lower case click login for new users running firmware 8.1 or higher you will be prompted to change this default password before proceeding the main page we'll see is the dashboard wand connection status tells us the internet connections we have active along with their priority group here we have our wan a hard-wired ethernet connection which is in priority group 1 and currently connected priority group 2 is listed with wi-fi wan on 2.4 gigahertz and under disabled is wi-fi when on five gigahertz also called wi-fi as wan this feature allows the soho to use an external wi-fi source as its internet connection this would be used for campground wi-fi or even your phone as a hotspot the priority groups are also used as your failover preferences so if we ever lose connection on wan priority one wi-fi gwen on priority two would come online these when connections are all moved by dragging and dropping them under your desired priority so if you click and drag one of the connections under disabled you can make that move without having to click any buttons or go into any alternate menus this is meant to save time and make things easy for you as the user the other parts of the main dashboard page include your lan interface so it lists your router ip address and it also has your wi-fi ap that's the wireless network you're broadcasting from the soho there's a drop down menu here to the right where you can turn your wireless on and off if you click details it'll bring you to the page that gives you more information on your wi-fi network currently we have two ssid configured clicking on the ssid will take us into its configuration you can set a wi-fi schedule which we'll cover later set up lan id and either hide or in this case show the ssid under security settings is where we can set the policy as well as a password which is labeled here as shared key lastly we've got the access control settings guest protect and firewall settings all of which we can use to allow or deny access into the network going back to the previous page we can click the new ss id button to create up to two more ssid this way if you're running the soho in your home office like we are you have different options available to you back to the dashboard page again the last section is your device information this displays the device name the firmware build your uptime cpu load and your current router throughput the next tab at the top is speed fusion cloud which may or may not be shown on your pep wave this will only be displayed with 8 point 1.0 firmware or higher but will not if you've configured the router to hide this information we'll skip this for now and move to the network tab this will cover your network settings the local area network is shown first we can change things like the ip address which is 192.168.50.1 by default peplink lists this default address as untagged lan click the name to edit the configuration you can change the name address dhcp range and where you can manually set dhcp reservations moving back you can also click on new lan to create virtual local area networks which can be used for guests or devices you need to isolate from others on your primary lan if needed this is also where you can set static routes and dns proxy settings clicking on port settings on the left will allow you to set the lan port speed and vlan id for each of the four lan ports but only if you have lands configured you'll also have the wide area network section which is going to mirror what we have at the main dashboard page but also include a new feature on firmware 8.1.1 called wan quality monitoring this is set to auto by default but you can adjust the configuration to monitor only specific connections what we didn't cover at the dashboard is the wan configuration settings these are under details to the right you can set the connection method dns settings and bandwidth values here scroll down to find the health check settings and adjust how it monitors and resets your connection when there's an outage there's a bandwidth allowance monitor to track and disconnect your connection based on a user-defined limit additional ip settings and dynamic dns hosting the serv soho really gives you the freedom to configure your network as the service dictates and in the best way possible for your usage just as it sounds the advanced tab is where you're going to find all the advanced configuration settings this includes pepvpn this is peplink's proprietary site to site vpn that works just like speedfusionvpn but without all the benefits this is a way you can create a virtual private network between your surf soho and another peplink or pepwave router that also supports pep vpn or speed fusion regarding the speed fusion cloud tab this is a cloud-based service provided by peplink that allows you to create an unbreakable connection when using multiple wan connections this includes when smoothing to help with packet loss and bandwidth bonding check out our video called peplinxpepvpn world's easiest vpn new 8.1 firmware if you're interested back to the advanced tab we can also find the outbound policy this is for controlling how our outgoing connections are routed set certain connections to have access to the pep vpn or enforce some devices to use only one of your wan connections port forwarding is where you can set rules to open ports that direct inbound traffic to different local devices on your network next is quality of service rules so you can control bandwidth and prioritize connections like voice over ip or streaming applications you can edit and apply new firewall rules as well as block specific content and or websites from users remote user access is where you'll configure client to site type vpn connections this includes l2tp with ipsec pptp and openvpn under miscellaneous on the left you have service forwarding and service passthrough along with settings that are used in conjunction with captive portal certificates and cellular if you're using a usb modem the ap tab will take us back to our wi-fi configuration this time we'll take a look at the other settings on the left which will look much different on firmware versions 8.1.0 and earlier wireless mesh is a new feature that will allow you to link to pepwave's external wi-fi access points wirelessly previously the only way to extend your wireless signal was by hardwiring access points to the soho's lan ports under settings on the left we can set the radio frequency 2.4 or 5 gigahertz for each ssid we have configured you can set the channel settings channel width and output power all of which are going to be helpful in troubleshooting connection issues client signal strength threshold will help to ensure your devices only connect when the signal is strong enough this setting and the next maximum number of clients can help when using multiple access points operating schedule lets you set a time frame when the wi-fi is accessible schedule settings will be covered under the next tab system the last sections here on the left under status will give you more details about the current state of the access points ssid overview client connections and details about other wi-fi signals in the environment this type of control is not typically found on other consumer or home business routers in its class be aware that any user with the soho serial number can create and add the soho to their in control account assuming it has not already been added to an account if you do not plan on using this feature peplink advises you to disable it there's also some network administration tools including ping trace route wake on lan and analysis tests for wan connections the final tab is status basically this gives you the information on your device the mac addresses of each of your network interfaces active sessions will show specific types of traffic currently passing over your network the client list will show you exactly what's connected via wi-fi or ethernet this is also a very easy way to add dhcp reservations simply click on the button under the import column for the device and save from there pepvpn will show the status of your pep vpn and speed fusion cloud and take you to where you can test these connections event log tracks connection and device alerts and lastly you have usage for keeping track of bandwidth usage in real time hourly daily and monthly click on each to get more details on what clients were online and their usage tracked for that period that completes our overview of the

{"id": "a4A1hPkpEXw", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "pxU_IyMGTKqyVP19MuSg26EtlFg", "transcript": "whether you've configured a router before or you're a new user you may or may not be familiar with vpn there are multiple types of vpn so we want to take a moment to explain the different types and how they compare first vpn stands for virtual private network and it is a means of connecting devices to each other remotely since the connections over the vpn are private they are generally secure but some vpn types provide more security than others when it comes to vpn connections there are two types the pep link hardware supports one is considered a client-to-site connection and one is considered as site-to-site connection client-to-site means you are connecting a personal device such as your cell phone tablet or laptop to a router at a remote location our personal device is the client and the site or server as it's sometimes referred is our peplink router that being said in the case of a site to site vpn connection this is a connection between two or more routers client-to-site vpn connections include l2tp with ipsec pptp and openvpn as an example let's say we're at the local coffee shop connected to their free wi-fi with our laptop if we want to do some online banking securely we can connect to the peplink router at our home using any of these vpn connections however it's important to note that this is only possible if the internet connection at your home has a publicly routable ip address such as a static ip this means it can be accessed from an outside connection provided it has the correct information and credentials to do so once we're connected to the vpn any information that we send and receive through our laptop is going to be encapsulated and transmitted securely from the coffee shop wi-fi through the open internet and back to our pep wave at home this protects us from any potential threats on the coffee shop wi-fi network and it also lets us access local devices on our pep wave such as security cameras or a hard drive all as if we were connected directly to our home network while we take a quick look at the peplink configuration pages we want to make sure this is clear our laptop in this case still requires an internet connection it cannot use the internet connection from your pep wave at home it's simply a means to secure your connection over a public network while simultaneously providing remote access to devices on your home network if needed that brings us to the site to site vpn connections all peplink and pepwave router support pepvpn which is peplink's simple approach to internet protocol security vpn or ipsec vpn for short most hardware also supports ipsec this does not include wi-fi access points the surf soho mk3 or outdoor rated hardware just like with client-to-site vpns site-to-site vpn connections will require a static or public internet ip address on at least one of the routers here's a preview of each site to cite vpn ipsec is up first site-to-site connections are typically made for sharing access to devices and files across each network ipsec is a common vpn protocol used by several router manufacturers on your peplink or pepwave router ipsec can be used to connect to another peplink or pepwave router as well as cisco and juniper routers though when you're using all peplink and pepwave hardware pepvpn is a comparable method that will save you time as you'll see here pepvpn works in the same manner as ipsec meaning they both provide a way of connecting two remote networks together here's a view of the pep vpn configuration profile the difference in settings is quite obvious you still have enough for what's needed but in most cases this is all we'll have to enter name encryption authentication and remote ip address or host name on one router the rest are default settings before moving on there's one more thing we want to clarify as common as hacking is these days there's several vpn services you can pay for that advertise they'll protect your internet traffic along with features like content blocking the vpn service masks your ip address with a random one from their servers providing you the secure connection services like these usually consist of a program you can download onto your computer mobile device and in some cases your router until puplink released firmware 8.1.1 this was not supported now users have the option to purchase an open vpn when license but it will still require the use of a third party for the openvpn access peplink's pepvpn can be used to build a reliable network with minimal setup but what is pepvpn exactly this is proprietary to peplink and pepwave hardware and is built upon the same engine that is used by the speed fusion bonding technology like ipsec vpn pepvpn is a device-to-device vpn protocol that is extremely easy to set up and configure it provides a full 256 bit aes encryption and is compatible with any existing peplink and pepwave hardware to give you a real-world example let's say we have a balance 380 at our primary office and we're using a max br1 in the remote office using pep vpn we have a very simple way to connect to remote networks to allow communication between networks and devices as well as share network resources the first thing we'll do is configure the maxbr1 to enable pepvpn we'll give it a local id this is a unique name used to create the vpn tunnel we'll need to make note of this id as it will be entered on the balance 380. save and apply changes once applied click new profile every profile requires a name we'll call this london office since that's the name of the remote network enable should be checked encryption will default to 256 bit aes or you can turn it off remote id is going to be the local id of the network you're trying to connect to in our case this is london pre-shared key is an optional field that will fill in for added security this must match on each router's configuration nat mode will typically be disabled unless your routers need to use the same ip address the next field is for remote ip addresses or host names this is going to be where you fill in the public ip address or dynamic domain name of the remote network in other words this is the external ip address of its internet connection this only has to be filled in on one side of the tunnel our balance 380 uses public static ip addresses so we'll need to enter those here note that the vpn can connect with just one address the rest of the settings cost data port and receive buffer will remain default for most users the other options under wan connection priority apply to the wan links to be used for the vpn now that this part is done we'll click save and apply changes the next step is to configure our balance 380 vpn profile this is located under the network tab you'll notice that the local id is set for london which is what we just entered in on the br1 profile as its remote id just like on the br one we'll create a new profile with new york office as the name we'll make sure encryption is set fill in our remote id and pre-shared key and since we already have a remote ip address set on the br one we can leave this blank we can also turn off some wan connections here if we like click save then apply changes after applying changes we can move back to the dashboard of either router and see the pep vpn status it will take a moment but you will soon see a new section appear called pep vpn with speed fusion the status will show starting followed by creating tunnels though sometimes like in this case it moves directly to updating routes each router obtains the necessary network data and finally the status will show established if you get stuck here confirm your configuration and firmware match if needed reboot the routers to look at some information about your pep vpn connection we can click on the status button over here to the right the information shown tells you the ip of the remote network that you're communicating with when you click on the blue arrow it will tell you which links we have active and the red and green boxes signify which links are actually connected to the vpn profile from here you can also run tests on your connection though those are more helpful when utilizing speed fusion", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2021-01-27T21:30:58Z",

This rugged networking router has four embedded cellular modems for use with all major 3G/4G/LTE carriers. It also has two wired WAN and one USB external modem port along with Wi-Fi as WAN capabilities, giving businesses up to eight ISP connections. Automatic failover means your network will never go down because one provider does, as the router will immediately switch traffic over to healthy service(s). The Max HD4 Quad with MediaFast also has caching technology that reduces costs and network loads by retrieving content during off-peak hours\n\nLet your router intelligently combine all active services using either load balancing or Pepwave’s SpeedFusion Bonding for faster data transfer speeds. Load balancing allows network administrators to prioritize connections so your company never has to worry about hitting data caps or using a less optimal provider. Bonding, on the other hand, gives your network military-grade VPN security and 100 percent uptime with a working WAN connection. Either option can be monitored anywhere using the cloud-based InControl 2 management system. With the dual long-range Wi-Fi radio, you can also make the Wi-Fi as WAN your incoming connect using remote access points.\n\nPepwave load balancing/bonding router models are available for the North American and European markets along with Cat6 Max HD4 routers that can be used in either region. Each one is made with industrial components and a metal enclosure that is certified to stand up to extreme temperatures and rough conditions. Built-in surge protection adds additional reliability for use in vehicles, surveillance and other tough applications.

features on the peplink balance one using in control 2 pep Link's cloud-based management software what I have for you in the background here is our peplink balance one web user interface we're looking at the dashboard screen and you can see we have an internet connection established there's no other requirements in order to set up your balance since we'll do the rest of our configuration through in control 2 to set up the captive portal you'll log into in control and you'll need to create a group and add your device to a new group we'll go ahead and go to our organization and create a group for our purposes we'll call this 3G store and usually you would give your group a location and an address once that is ready you'll go ahead and create your group the next step is to enter the serial number for your device into the group so it can be added to in control with Device added you can now give it a custom name and add device now that our group has been created and our balance is showing online we're going to go into our group settings for the wireless network we'll enable Wi-Fi management and save those changes this lets in control take over the balances Wi-Fi settings we're going to create two separate SS IDs here the first one will be a employee group and the second will be our captive portal guest group add new SSID we'll call this 3G Store Main we'll set a password and then save those changes next we'll set up our guest SS ID we'll call this 3G store guest we'll leave the encryption to open because we'll have our users authenticate via their email address we'll scroll down through the bottom of our settings and we'll enable the captive portal feature with captive portal enabled we now have a number of different ways we can configure our access point social lets us log in through things like Facebook and Linkedin Open Access means that anybody can connect to the network without any type of authentication guest account lets you create create or upload a CSV file with different usernames and passwords for our purposes we're going to use email as our authentication method we'll go ahead and enable this we'll have our email collect Our Guest name but we don't need their country we'll give them 5 minutes to log into their email and accept the email that we send and for our sender name we'll just call this admin now we also want to impose a restriction on our guest Wi-Fi users so we're going to change our quota to a bandwidth based allowance and we'll give everybody 50 megabytes our quota then will reset at 1:00 in the morning so now when a guest authenticates to the network they can verify their email connect and they'll have 50 megabytes of usage per day we'll go ahead and save those changes and now in control has our 3G Store Main and our 3G store guest networks's creative you can see that we have our captive portal enabled on our second Network once in control has been updated we can now go back to the balance and we'll see our changes have already been applied now you see our Wi-Fi AP has our 3G Store Main with the padlock meaning it is secured and our 3G store guest which is unsecured but using our email authentication with the captive portal so now we are on an Android phone and we're going to open up our wireless search and connect to our new 3G store guest Network that we created through in control 2 we'll go ahead and select that Network and you can see it shows no security and will connect depending on the device you may get a prompt that says extra actions are required or you may just need to open up a web browser to get to the captive portal page opening up our browser on the phone you can see we're immediately redirected to our welcome screen now we didn't change any of the default settings we left the peplink logo in background but you can fully customize the images text and terms and conditions page through in control 2 our next step here is to enter our email address that is prompted on the page we'll go ahead and submit this after agreeing to the terms and conditions the captive portal will now send us an email and we'll get a verification on the screen that tells us to check our box we'll go ahead now and open up our email and take a look at what that says so we have an email coming from admin which we specified in our in control 2 setup and there is a link to verify our

The HD4 has standard 2FF SIM slots - if you plan to use a micro or nano SIM, you'll need a SIM adapter.\n\n3Gstore is a Peplink Certified Partner\n\nFast Facts About This Product:\n\nThis router is best for: Enterprise users wanting to load balance and/or aggregate between several wireless internet connections and want a solution with embedded/integrated Verizon and AT&T 3G/4G modems (aggregation/bonding requires the Max HD4 and a Balance 210 or higher router, or SimplyBonding from 3Gstore).\n\nhttp://3gstore.com/product/5248_simply_bonding.html\n\nInternet Connections Supported: 4 Embedded 3G/4G, 2 Wired WAN, 1 USB (view full compatibility chart), WiFi as WAN* (more info)\nNetworks Supported for Embedded Modems: 4G LTE (B2/1900, B4/AWS (XLTE), B5/850, B13/700, B17/700, B25/1900), WCDMA/HSDPA/HSUPA/HSPA+/DC-HSPA+ (B1/2100, B2/1900, B4/AWS, B5/850, B8/900), EV-DO Rev.A (BC0/800, BC1/1900, BC10/800)\n\nWiFi Standard: 802.11 B, G, N; 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz (concurrent)\nWiFi Range: 300-400' through walls, much greater unobstructed (variable depending on interference from other electronics and physical interference such as walls and ceilings)\nEthernet ports: 8 GbE LAN + 2 GbE WAN\nSize: 1.9\" x 11.5\" x 6.9\"\n\nBonding: SpeedFusion VPN Bonding. NOTE: Many factors influence the real-world throughput you'll see from bonded connections, including latency, connection type, connection speeds, traffic type, and reliability on both sides of the SpeedFusion tunnel. Cellular users should note that bonded cellular connections suffer from \"flow control\" of TCP traffic at the carrier level, and 3Gstore cannot guarantee that bonding multiple cellular connections will result in faster speeds (however, the other benefits of SpeedFusion remain, such as unbreakable VPN, session persistence, and 100% up-time as long as you have 1 healthy WAN).\n\nMany mobile Internet options are available today, including 3G/4G cellular, Wi-Fi, Satellite, WiMAX, LTE, and many more. However, coverage and speeds vary drastically between providers and locations. The Pepwave MAX allows you to combine multiple wireless Internet connections and intelligently manages them to accommodate the changing environment. Everything is automatic. You can stay connected and productive.\n\nOur unique modular approach gives you the freedom to choose exactly what Internet services are the best fit for your area. Unlike other mobile routers the MAX doesn't force you to use one technology or provider - you can combine the benefits of up to six connections. You have the freedom to connect to whatever provider or technology makes sense for your application. Need more bandwidth? Add another connection. Coverage poor in some areas? Add another provider. The MAX intelligently manages all connections to give you the best experience possible.", "channelTitle": "5Gstore", "categoryId": "28", "liveBroadcastContent": "none"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT3M15S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "projection": "rectangular"}, "status": {"uploadStatus": "processed", "privacyStatus": "public", "license": "youtube", "embeddable": true, "publicStatsViewable": true, "madeForKids": false}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "11699", "likeCount": "43", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "11"}}

This device is a white box with a cellular antenna that acts as a backup connection to your primary internet connection. If your primary internet connection fails, the Cellguard system takes over and runs your alarm over a cellular network.\n\nEverybody understands the importance of having an alarm system, and the benefits of the Safewatch Cellguard are many. The device works in the event of a power outage, lets your alarms function when your ISP is down or experiencing network issues, doesn’t rely on any phone lines, and gives you peace of mind that you’ll be protected 24/7. Something that many people overlook is the cellular signal available where the Cellguard will be installed. A cellular backup is great, but if there isn’t adequate signal available, how can it protect you?\n\nEnter the Cel-Fi PRO Signal Booster for AT&T. The Cel-Fi does away with all the complicated setup, issues, and installation costs of typical signal boosters. No mounting antennas to the roof, running cables through walls and ceilings, and no unsightly panel or dome antennas on the walls and ceilings. Instead the Cel-Fi PRO has just two pieces of hardware, a Network Unit (NU) and a Coverage Unit (CU). Installation is as simple as placing the NU in a window where the AT&T signal is the strongest and connecting it to power. The CU is then placed elsewhere in the home or office and connected to power. The NU picks up and amplifies the AT&T signal, wirelessly sends the signal to the CU, and the CU pushes out an amplified cellular signal for any devices in range. It is that simple!\n\nThe Cel-Fi PRO will do double duty for you. First it will ensure your Safewatch Cellguard has a strong connection to the cellular network. This means your backup connection for your ADT alarm will be working for you 24/7. Even if it is installed in the center of a brick or metal building, it can be in the reach of the Cel-Fi. Because the Cel-Fi PRO covers up to 13,000 square feet there are very few places it can’t work for you. The second the job the Cel-Fi does of course is to boost the AT&T signal to other devices.

With the ability to automatically reset devices when internet connectivity is lost, schedule power cycles, and prevent truck rolls for simple hardware reboots, there isn’t a situation where this won’t save you time and money.\n\nWhat if you are in a situation where you have a modem and separate router, and want to monitor them individually? Many 3Gstore customers have been in the situation where they have a rock solid router that doesn’t need to be reset normally, and a modem that fails often. Simply letting the IP Switch power cycle both on an internet failure is an option, but that can mean unnecessary local downtime if its just the modem that has failed. Simply not plugging the routers power into the IP Switch means just the modem would reset, but what if the router does lock up, and there is nobody there to reset it? Equipment on the LAN would be without communication. This could be a camera and DVR, or any other device that doesn’t need an internet connection to function. Below are the steps to configure the 2 Outlet IP Switch to fix that problem.\n\nFor more information and links to alternative ways to locate the IP Switch on your network, visit our full article on EVDOinfo: http://www.evdoinfo.com/content/view/4972/64/\n\nFor more information or to contact the experts at 3Gstore, visit http://3Gstore.com/ipswitch", "channelTitle": "5Gstore", "categoryId": "28", "liveBroadcastContent": "none"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT3M8S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "projection": "rectangular"}, "status": {"uploadStatus": "processed", "privacyStatus": "public", "license": "youtube", "embeddable": true, "publicStatsViewable": true, "madeForKids": false}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "2573", "likeCount": "10", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0"}}

switches 3G store offers a variety of Ip switches including the two Outlet IP switch one Outlet IP switch and a variety of iboot models depending on your installation first we're going to take a look at the similarities between the two and one Outlet switches each IP switch can automatically power cycle any device if internet connectivity is lost prevent a connection from going dormant power cycle devices on a schedule and can be controlled remotely with free applications the automatic power cycle of equipment is one of the key features on each IP switch so we're going to demonstrate that here by pulling the internet connection out of a router now the outlet can no longer see an internet connection and once it has failed its health checks it will power cycle that router off and then back on again to try and regain that connectivity if you're watching lights on the router on the right you'll see them switch off that is when the switch is now powered off the outlets and now that remote equipment is powered back on automatically a few features that are unique to the two outlet switch include the number of and ways you can configure the power schedules up to 20 unique power schedules can be created for a variety of days of the week every week times of the day and different actions per each outlet depending on your use sped up here we have an example of one of those uses where we are automatically powering off two different lights now this can be any two different pieces of equipment we have a power schedule that will turn off one outlet and then turn it back on just a minute later we've also set up a second power schedule to the second outlet for a few minutes later that's then going to turn off that second device and turn it back on just a minute later this can be for lights security systems modems and routers or even video cameras that have trouble staying online consistently in remote locations and you don't have the ability to get on the scene to power them off and on remotely the money saved on truck rolls to remote equipment usually outweighs the cost of the IP switch with just its first couple of uses five addresses are configurable for pinging external sites as well as local addresses of sensitive equipment just because the two outlet switch is meant to work remotely and automatically it doesn't mean you can't go in and manually control it using Google talk now called Google Hangouts you can send instant message commands to the switch and it will immediately respond git status will tell you the current ping responses for the configurable addresses git IP can tell you the WAN and local IP address of the switch on a network entering a command incorrectly is okay as well as it will simply just respond with the help options for how you will format your messages so as an example set set Outlet one on without a space did not give us the right response but set on one says done which means the outlet one has been powered on remotely while the two outlet switch has many more configurable features the one outlet switch is much simpler and easier to use the web interface here is much more basic compared to the two Outlet version and really only provides you needed information and you have a minimal amount of schedules you can set up here the key feature of the one outlet switch though is its mobile application support free IOS and Android apps are available for remote control of the outlet you can individually go into each outlet you have added to your application power cycle on off or reset devices connected to the outlet you can control things like the power schedules all through the mobile application so you really never even need to sit down at a computer to set anything up on the switch the iboot comes in a variety of models depending on your needs there is the ioot G2 model the iboot g2+ the iboot EXP for use with the g2+ and a DC model the connection and setup of an iboot is also very straightforward there is an included cord for connecting the iboot to power you then have another power cord this is going to be where you plug in the device that you wish to monitor or control you then connect an Ethernet cable between the iboot and the rest of your network and now it is online and ready to be configured the G2 plus model also has a USB port for connecting to a PC one end of a USB port plugs into the ioot while the other end goes directly into a Windows PC or server using the free companion software the switch will talk to the PC and perform a graceful shutdown of that equipment if it's required the EXP units are compatible with the g2+ meaning a single g2+ can have three Outlets controlled from a single IP address for for specialty installations there's also an iboot DC model for direct connection to DC powered appliances such as solar panels or pumps and motors iboot cloud services is a centralized management page where you can control all of your I booots from a single location to

multiple power options to fit your needs let's begin with a brief overview of the physical interface besides the Dual RSA 2.4 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna connectors there's also a spot for the main modem antenna one for the auxiliary modem and one for the active GPS all three of which are SMA on one side you have the power and USB port plus three ethernet ports all of which are Lan when switchable on the reverse side you will find the rs232 connector and your power reset button press and hold the power button for 1 second to power the device 5 Seconds to power off and 10 seconds to factory reset keep in mind a factory reset will clear any changes you have made to the router excluding firmware updates to activate either device using a SIM card a wireless broadband data PL plan must be added to your cradle Point core ibr 1100 series device wireless broadband data plans are available from Wireless carriers such as Verizon AT&T Sprint e and vhone the Sim must be provisioned with the carrier please contact your carrier for details regarding selecting a data plan and about the process for provisioning your sim once you have activated the SIM card grab a small fill up screwdriver and start by removing the bottom Sim cover now Slide the metal latch down to unlock the Sim cartridge use the cartridge Mark Sim 1 first pull the cartridge upwards so it is standing at a 90° angle insert the SIM card with the metal contacts down and Notch out press the cartridge back into place now return the metal lat to the start position finally replace the bottom Sim cover please please note that the device will not power on without the cover in place due to the diversity of customer needs antennas are not included in the product package cradle Point offers several antenna accessory options including options for 3G 4G modems GPS and Wi-Fi as well as direct attach bolt Mount and magnetic mounts shown here is the 5 in-1 bolt Mount which includes five separate 3M cables with the following two 3G 4G modem antennas two 2.45 GHz Wi-Fi antennas and one GPS antenna the gpio cable includes four wires number one is the black ground wire number two is the red power wire number three is the orange input wire and number four is the blue output wire the black ground wire needs to be grounded to the chassis of the vehicle the red power wire needs to be connected to the battery for constant power please also note that the red wire requires a 2.5 amp inline fuse the orange input wire is connected to the ignition switch the power and ignition wires can be wired directly or through the vehicle's fuse panel another great feature of the core ibr 1100 series is the gpio functionality which can be used for vehicle ignition sensing when the vehicle is turned off the router will stay on for the specified length of time and then automatically shut itself off an example of this would be a police patrol stopping and turning off the vehicle then continuing to use Wi-Fi connectivity to submit and file a report without having to leave the field to configure this feature in the router log into your admin pages and go to system settings gpio connector in the input pin section set the input mode to ignition sensing then set time out to the desired number of seconds hit apply when you are finished the core ibr 1100 series comes with an integrated mounting bracket in this example we are using self-drilling screws used for Sheet Metal installations here we are using a mounting bracket and rail when it comes to mounting in vehicles there are a number of options to consider keep in mind that wire connections vary depending on the installation make sure to only use connectors rated for use with the wire gauge you are using crimp connectors quick splice connectors and inline fuse holders are more examples of items you might require depending on your installation", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2014-10-13T18:35:48Z", "channelId": "UCPfPFshSC-rH4IbaClXrWSQ", "title": "CradlePoint

show you just how easy it is to set up you can set up the device connector for use as both an access point and a wireless repeater all you have to do to set it up is make sure it is plugged into power and your device connectors ready the wi-fi antenna will both pick up a signal wirelessly and re-broadcast out a new private network if you're looking to extend or create a secure network all you have to do to set it up is connect your pc to the device connector with an ethernet cable once you are connected you'll go ahead and open up your computer and go to your system preferences this is set up on a mac and i'll show you windows right after click on your network icon and you'll see your usb ethernet connection or ethernet connection depending on your mac switch your ipv4 method to manually and enter the following ip address 192.168.20.100 the next line for subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 router is the address of your device connector that's 192.168.20.1 once these are entered go ahead and click apply windows takes a couple more steps you'll open up your network and internet and go to the network and sharing center on the left hand side you'll click change adapter setting and on your ethernet connection right click it and head down and select properties now with the properties window if it's not visible right away scroll down and head to the section labeled internet protocol version 4. click on it so it is highlighted and click the properties window in this final window here's where you're going to enter the same settings that we did on the mac click use following ip address and enter 192.168.20.100. then you'll head to the subnet mask that by default is correct and for gateway it's 192.168.20.1 leave the dns section alone go ahead and click ok and on the bottom of your screen click close now we're ready to actually configure the device connector so you'll open up your favorite web browser and enter 192.1 this will either bring you directly to the device connector or let you know that there's an error viewing a certificate and you'll have to click proceed to continue here we have the device connector pulled up and on the left there's two different operating modes you'll select the wired option if you want to run this as an access point plugged into another router or wi-fi if you're going to be using it as a wireless repeater for your home or for example a campground wi-fi setting this up you'll click on the settings button and that will load up your screen where you're going to make a couple of different changes there are a lot of different options here but in its most basic configuration there's only two sections that you'll need to change scroll down the page and you'll see a heading that's labeled wi-fi wan settings this is where you're going to select the name of the network that you're going to be repeating in the wireless network name click in the white box and the device connector will list out a number of different networks because this has a very long range a thousand feet or more you'll pick up a number of different networks if we're using this network we'll go ahead and click it it'll automatically enter the authentication required and you'll just need the wi-fi password for the network if there is one heading down to the bottom of the page you'll go to the section labeled ap settings this is where you'll set up the name of the wi-fi network your device connector is going to repeat you can use configure automatically if you wanted to repeat the same network say you're extending an existing one or if you're creating your own you'll head to the configure manual section and enter your own name we'll call this device connector generically authentication you can choose your connection method and then for encryption key you'll enter your own password at least eight characters long once that has been entered head to the very bottom of the page and click save after a moment your screen will refresh and now you're ready to make sure this is connected head up on the top left and click dashboard and you'll be back on the very first page you saw when you first entered your device connector on the top right you'll see the status and currently it says wireless one is disconnected in a few moments it's going to begin searching for the signal and it will try to attach to that first network that you're trying to either repeat or create a private network from now it says it is scanning and acquiring network address after a few moments the device connector will lock onto that host network and an ip address will show at this point you know the signal is ready the device connector is set to be online and at this point you just have to set your computer back and test the internet connection if you're setting this up on a mac you'll go right back into where we originally changed the settings and switch it back to dhcp on the bottom of the screen click apply and your network will disconnect and reconnect with a new ip address that's from the host network at this point you're ready to test your connection on windows go ahead and switch everything back to automatic and click ok and close now we're ready to test out our internet connection go into your address bar and enter a website of your choice and make sure you have connectivity if you do you're ready to go at this point you can unplug the ethernet cable from your device connector as it is already set up and you can connect to it through its wi-fi when you unplug the device connector and plug it in again it remembers all its settings and will automatically make your connection for more information visit 3gstore.com device connector and for more videos like this be sure to subscribe to our channel thank you",

and how easy it is to setup. This can be used in two ways. First, the DC is a very powerful access point with indoor ranges of up to 1000', much greater unobstructed. Simply connect by ethernet into your network, and your existing router can manage this, and anybody connected to the WiFi of the DC will be on the same network as your original router. Second, you can use this is a WiFi repeater or range extender. The DC can pickup a WiFi signal and use it as a source of internet, at the same time it will repeat either the same network or a new SSID and password of your choice. This is known as WiFI as WAN.

your ethernet cable connected to your router and then the power cable go ahead and connect these to your single outlet switch and the switch will power on when the switch powers on you'll see a series of lights across the left hand side the first blinking green light indicates the switch is at its factory defaults and is in manual control mode there's a red light that tells you if the plug on top is powered or not and a yellow light indicating if the switch is connected out to the internet we already have the mobile application installed so we'll bring that up on the right hand side of your

go off and turn back on back to the menu and into the settings you have the options for how the switch is controlled right now it's in manual default but you can switch it to auto reset clicking save will make that change and on the actual switch you'll see the blinking green light now go solid indicating this is complete auto reset is perfect for resetting an internet connection to a modem or router when the connectivity is lost aside from the option for manual and automatic control you can also set the switch on a schedule the schedule will let you select a time of day and day of the week that the switch will either turn on or off all of the options so far can be done from anywhere in the world through the application firmware updates however require you to be on the local area network of the outlet clicking more and then device upgrade will give you the firmware options it will automatically search your local area network find any connected outlets tell you the firmware version that it's on and in the upper right tell you if a new version is available once you have your outlet selected you'll click on it and it will bring up the instruction for how to perform a firmware upgrade going back now to the switch on the left step 1 is to power off the device you can do this simply by unplugging the power cord step 2 says to press and hold the function button click and hold this and then perform step three which is to power the device back on once this is done you'll see that the red and yellow light will both go solid meaning the switch is in its upgrade mode back to the application clicking continue will start the upgrade process once the upgrade is started you'll have a progress bar telling you exactly what percent you are through the process it only takes about 30 seconds and this is done in real time as you're watching it now the outlet will blink back and forth letting you know it is performing the upgrade and once it's complete the switch will unpack the firmware and reset itself depending on what version of firmware you're flashing onto the switch you will get a message that'll let you know the switch is going to return to its factory defaults now that the switch is back online you can see it's in its original state before we did any changes to it through the application once it's connected then back with the yellow light you know that the upgrade is complete and you can then begin controlling your switch through the application again for more information visit 3gstore.com ipswich and for more videos like this be sure to subscribe to

soho and getting a closer look at the admin interface for the pep wave surf soho your admin interface is at 192.168.50.1 once you're there you're going to fill in your username and password both of these default to admin so once you have those typed in you can go ahead and click log in from the home page the first thing that's going to load is a section called wan connection status this tells us what internet connections we have active and what priority groups they are in currently we have our hardwired ethernet as when and it is connected priority group 2 is listed as wi-fi as when wi-fi is wan is a feature on the soho where you can use an external wi-fi source as your internet this is going to be used for campground rfe open wi-fi or even your phone as a hotspot the priority groups are also used as your failover preferences so if we ever lose connection on wan 1 priority 2 the wi-fi is when will kick in and become our active internet connection these wan connections are all drag and drop so if you click and drag one of the priorities and put it down to disabled you can move that without having to click any buttons or go into any alternate menus this is meant to save a lot of time and make things easy for you as the user the other parts of the home page are your lan interface so it lists your router i p address and it also has your wi-fi ap that's your wireless network you've created and are broadcasting from your soho there's a drop down menu where you can turn your wireless on and off and if you click details it'll bring you to the page that gives you more information on your network currently we have our one network setup and it's secured with wpa2 clicking on it gives us the wi-fi name we can choose to enable this or broadcast the ssid and it also has security settings as well as access control settings where we can filter out by mac address the other thing that's in the wi-fi settings is an add button the add button will actually let you put up to three wireless networks off of your single serve soho this way if you're running this in the home or business you have different options available to you the very last part of the home page is your device information just gives you the device name the firmware build your uptime cpu load and your current router throughput the next tab over is in your network settings network settings will let you change things like your ip address it has the default 50.1 address but you can change it to whatever you want so you don't have conflicting pieces of hardware on your network you also can change the port speeds dhcp ranges and some static routes the other option you have is under when when is going to be a mirror of what you had on the first page with the drag and drop the other thing you can do from here is click on the details tab and it will give you some information on health check settings to reset your connection in case of an outage and you can also set up dynamic dns hosting from here as well the surf soho really gives you the freedom to configure your network in the best way for you the advanced tab is where you can get into more detail on your device the wi-fi settings has options between internal or external antennas the surf soho has two exterior antenna ports where you can place just about any wi-fi antenna so if you need the additional range a simple click in the interface will switch that over for you you can also switch the type of protocol your wi-fi access point broadcast so if you have legacy devices that can't run on n you can certainly lock it down switch the wi-fi channel and the output power there is also a boost mode on the serv soho you just need to make sure you check with your local regulations and make sure you can have that much power one of the new features on the surf soho is called pep vpn pep vpn is a way that you can create a virtual private network between your surf soho and higher end balance series routers it is important to keep in mind this only works between other pop wave devices however that is part of what keeps the cost down on the surf soho port forwarding is also available so you can direct inbound traffic to different locations on your network if you need more advanced routing there are mappings available the other option you have is quality of service this is going to let you define what type of application runs over your network and what priority it's assigned this is going to be for setting up a specific type of service that you need to prioritize we just set up video streaming there is high so if your network is limited on resources it will keep these running there's firewall options on the soho for both inbound and outbound rules the other thing soho gives you is denial of service prevention this way for using it in the business you don't have to worry about outside attacks pptp server is something that we're going to show in a separate video basically it's one more way that you can set up a virtual private network and of course there is also service forwarding and service pass-through back at the top underneath the system tab you have a few more things there's security where you can set up the name of your router as well as changing the default password you can also configure what port your router listens on for web administration and you can set it up for lan or wan access and on the bottom you can see which interfaces we have set up to respond to that when access port this gives you just one more way that you can access your surf soho remotely the other things you have access to are firmware you can automatically check for firmware on pepwave server or you can manually upload one that you've downloaded from them there's a couple other features a very cool one is in control incontrol is a special management system that lets you remotely manage any of your pep wave devices all at once from a single interface this type of control is not found on any other consumer or home business routers in this class there's of course also some network administration tools ping traceroute and pep vpn test this way for network administration you have a way to test your network the final tab is under status basically will give you the information on your device the mac addresses of each of your ports you can look at active sessions to see what specific type of traffic is passing over your network client list will let you show exactly what's connected so on the top it says there is one thing connected via wi-fi there is a second device but it's currently disconnected so this is a good way that you can manage all of your connected clients obviously pep vpn status and event log the bandwidth tools down at the bottom we actually get a little bit more in depth in another one

can use it to build a reliable network with minimal setup the first question you'll have is what is Pep VPN pep VPN is built upon the same engine that is used by speed Fusion's Wan bonding technology it's a device to device VPN protocol that's extremely easy to set up and configure it provides a full 256 bit AES encryption and is compatible with existing speed Fusion Hardware this will now be available on all single active Wan devices from peplink to give you a real world example of how you can use pep VPN say we have a balance 380 in the primary office and we're using a pep VPN enabled Max br1 in the remote location using pep VPN we have a very simple way to configure two remote networks to speak to each other and to share network resources remotely setting up a speed Fusion enabled device to communicate with a pepep VPN enabled device is very easy the first thing we're going to do is look at our balance 380 and how to set that up so the first thing you'll do is go up and click on network and on the left hand side select the speed Fusion option you can see that we currently don't have any VPN connections or profiles to find in there so we'll do that in just a second first thing we need to do though is look at our local ID and make sure we have that set properly the local ID is used with speed fusion and pep VPN in order for the two networks to communicate with each other on our speed Fusion box we have the local ID set to London so we're going to have to enter that on the br1 side without the local ID enabled on each side of the pep VPN or speed Fusion tunnel the VPN will never be able to establish so now we're going to go ahead and set up a VPN profile back to our connection in New York which is the br1 we looked at earlier we're going to click on new profile and every profile is going to require a name so you'll have to set this up on both the 380 and the br1 we're going to call this New York office since that's the name of the network we're going to connect back to this is active and set to 256 AES encryption by default remote ID is going to be the local ID of the network you're trying to connect to so we're going to enter the local ID of the Max br1 and that is set as New York pre-shared key is an optional field in the pep VPN and speed Fusion connection essentially this would be a passphrase that you'd have to enter each location for an added level of security so it's more than just the remote ID that you need to connect by the next field is for remote IP addresses host names this is going to be where you fill in the IP address of the network you're going to be connecting to this only has to be filled in on one set of the device because pep VPN and speed Fusion will communicate the other network name back for you the other option you have is for a data Port we're going to leave that at default but if you know that a specific Port is blocked by your carrier you can switch all of your speed fusion and pep VPN traffic to a specific port number the other options for w connection priority apply to the speed Fusion device since it has multiple Wan links we have all of these set for Priority One highest right now but if we only wanted to use specific connections on our VPN tunnel we could switch them by priority once everything is configured the next step is to click save and in the top right hand corner click apply changes now that the balance 380 has been set up the next step is to take and open our Max br1 and set up the pep VPN profile there this is located under Advanced and pep VPN n you'll notice that under pvpn the local ID is set for New York that is what we just entered in on the balance 380 so now just like on the 380 we have to create a profile when we open this up it's going to ask us for a name so we're going to make this very simple and just call this London office it's going to be active with the 256bit AES encryption the remote ID on the balance 380 we set is where we're going to enter that here so that is London and the next part is remote IP addresses remember this says optional but you do have to enter that on at least one side of your pep VPN connection I already have this on my clipboard so I'll paste it in there remember we're connecting to a speed Fusion enabled device so they actually have two w links on the 380 side we can go ahead and enter both of those IP addresses however it is unnecessary pep VPN will establish the connection with a single IP address and once that connection is made multiple connections will be made back from the balance 380 on all the available Wan links this means if one of the IP addresses was to go down we'll have an unbreakable connection to our VPN The Next Step just like on the 380 is to click save and then apply changes in the top right to create the profile back on the dashboard of the max br1 we can see that it is applying the changes that we just made pep VPN now shows up with the London office profile we just created now that the VPN profile has been applied you can see it is switched to creating tunnel creating tunnel means the br1 has reached out and communicated with the balance 380 and it is establishing the VPN once creating tunnel is finished it will switch to updating routes this means the remaining W links from the balance 380 are being communicated to the br1 zooming in now you can see the pep VPN profile we just set up on the br1 says established that means that we have entered in all the correct IP information and the correct local ID to establish the VPN switching over to the balance 380 that we first looked at our profile we created through speed Fusion says established as well and the padlock signifies that we are encrypted through 256bit AES to look at some information about our pep VPN connection that we just established you'll click on the status button the profile for London office shows up and it tells you the IP of the remote Network that you're communicating with when you click on the blue arrow it will tell you which links we have active on our br1 and the red and green lights signify which links are actually connected to the speed Fusion or other pep VPN profile going back to the balance 380 and looking at the status we can bring that up pull up the profile that we set up for our New York office we can see the remote Network that we're connected to and which links are active in the profile now being a speed Fusion capable device there's multiple W links and they each have a green light meaning we have multiple VPN tunnels back to the br1 for failover now we demonstrated this today with a speed Fusion enabled balance router connecting to a br1 with pep VPN you can also set this up by hooking two pep VPN devices directly to each other the benefit to using a speed Fusion device at your primary location and deploying multiple pep VPN only devices in the field is if one of the WAN connections at the main office goes down there's still multiple VPN tunnels talking to each of the pep VPN devices this way there's an unbreakable VPN with no loss in connectivity for more information information on pvpn be sure to visit 3G store.com

today by Microsoft so we're just going to take a quick look at the uh new interface and uh just a couple problems that I've noticed with uh parallels 7 uh getting everything installed first thing that I want to point out if you are using parallels is you do have to disable the smart Mouse otherwise you're not going to be able to click on anything uh you're going to need to to go over here and you're going to want to stop the uh Os from actually running after you do that you'll just need to go into your tools and under your options just go over to Advanced and make sure you have Smart mouse off if you have it on auto your mouse isn't going to work and you're not going to be able to do anything so this is the basic interface here uh it's pretty straightforward it's kind of like the uh LaunchPad on the Mac OSX uh I don't like how it's kind of partitioned off you've got your start menu down here uh if you move the mouse over here any open applications you can kind of drag around if you right click on those that gives you the ability to close the tasks so some of the applications here I've tried a few of them I don't have um the calendar or anything like that set up but here's the basic weather app now I do like that you get a lot of different charts on here I'm surprised you don't have any real time announcements but again this is still well in beta form but uh you can click on a bunch of different uh video options there as well as get a description with some uh more detail on that uh you can scroll over to the right and you do have some other options available however the last time I did that uh it locked up on me so I'm not going to scroll over there uh again to get back to the start dashboard uh you just navigate to the lower left and click on that there uh so let's take a look and now I tried to load the maps but the Maps doesn't seem to work uh one app that I actually really liked was the the finance app that's integrated into it so here's a quick look at the uh finance app and what I like is the horizontal scrolling on it uh you get a lot of information about whichever stock that you're currently looking at so this is kind of the default view here one thing I didn't like is there's no way you can click point to point on a chart to see like the highs and the lows over a specific point in the day or the the week uh that's pretty standard and you would think it'd be integrated into the app but you can scroll over you've got your watch list and again you can click on a company there and get some more detailed information there so this is actually a nice app and it's kind of uh a little bit jealous that uh Mac OSX doesn't have something integrated like this uh like the stock app on the iPhone and iPad but let's go ahead and jump back out of here that's another thing it's kind of hard to to close out of the apps I just jump back over to the start menu here now their uh music application is actually really good uh this is kind of their attempt what it looks like to Def the throne iTunes here so you've got your Spotlight stuff and you can click on any artist here so we'll just click on car Underwood and then you've got the option to view all the albums I'll just click on an album here and let's just do a preview here I do like that it is animated where you're not really get getting the animation if you're familiar with iTunes but you can start playing that you can see It'll play in the background if I go back to the start menu it's currently playing on there disable here now that's the one thing you'll notice about the smart Mouse is it's really choppy so it'll take a little bit to get used to I don't know if parallels is going to patch that or come out with a better update so it's a little more friendly uh if you want to test out the Windows 8 application then you have your main desktop which is kind of the more traditional view however you're going to notice the this start command is no longer there again you just go over to the start menu if you want to check out the applications on it and then over on the right hand side uh you do have your settings the devices sharing again I don't really have anything set up I just installed this a little bit ago so I've just uh started playing with it then you've got you know your standard control panel for all your settings so everything is just kind of more or less moved around on it a a little bit now let me jump back into the the start menu when you first install this you're going to be on a uh administrator account so under the administrator like the weather and all these apps you're not going to be able to use however when I create another account you're going to notice that your mouse just kind of disappears so the only way I've been able to combat that is jump over to a a new user and just start clicking around randomly on things off of the the main desktop here and eventually you'll be able to see your mouse again otherwise for a while you'll probably get frustrated uh I don't know if it's a a video setting or not I haven't really messed around with the uh the Ram or anything I just have it uh defaulted it uh what is it on the video I've got 256 Mig and you know I've got one gig running right now uh spec on the machine just a iMac 34 i7 so I could bump that up and it probably run a little smoother I did notice a little chopping on the audio this is probably just kind of the parallels driver but uh you that's just kind of a quick brief overview uh I don't really get this whole dashboard when you've got the the desktop uh if you notice if I jump over to the Launchpad on the Mac everything is integrated right into it you can stream right around uh much more fluent and then you still have access to all your apps at the bottom so I think it's put together a little better be sure to let us know in the comments what you think of the Windows 8 consumer beta and what type of uh problems that you're finding on the new

it actually uses we get a lot of uh common misconceptions that gaming uses a lot more data than it actually does so in front of you I've got a pepwave Max 700 uh this is the interface there of course with my laptop monitoring everything basically what we're going to do is I'm going to launch my PS3 we're going to show some real-time data usage I'll game for about an hour and we'll take a look and see how much data we've actually used here so we do have a couple features on the peplink products there that are highly useful in tracking this so we're going to look at the real time uh data usage so let's go over here and as you can see right now I don't really have anything going on so I'm not using any data really and if I go back up I'm going to click on daily and we're going to select today now I have a bunch of DHCP reservations set up here since I haven't turned on uh my PS3 yet we're not even going to see that it's only going to display uh devices that are currently on the network there so let's get back out of here all right and I'm going to go back into the real time usage so just to give you a point of reference about 7:43 so we'll game till about A4 to 9 here all right so I'm going to go down to Wi one if I zoom out you can see my TV in the background that's off right now and and I'm going to go ahead and turn the PS3 on and the first thing of course it's going to do is it's going to start uh loading PSN and we should see it start uh using a little more data as it downloads my friend list and the avatars so it looks like I just signed in there you can see it's starting to peek up a little bit there and this is really where you're going to use the most data when you're logging in for the first time to load all your friends in the graphics and basically if you're looking to download game patches updates Etc uh it's just downloading avatars right now so it'll probably pick up a little bit but it'll drop off here and what I'm going to do is I'm going to launch Modern Warfare 3 here here so that's going on in the background and we're still getting uh about four M as it loads everything all Warfare okay so just getting everything loaded [Music] up let back [Music] here now I'm going to play ground war you can see it's starting to search for a match right now so notice how it's already uh going down quite a bit here now it looks like I'm just going in I'm going to start a timer on my iPhone timer start it here for an hour we're going to play a session I'll leave this run for a little bit so you guys can hear it kind of in game uh then we'll pan to the end of the hour we'll look at our we'll look at our daily data usage and see how much bandwidth we actually transmitted on both send and receive domination capture the objective I'm just going to do a quick voice over because I wanted to mention that these features that you see here the realtime charts uh the daily tracking or monthly tracking are available on all peplink products as well as the pepwave max 700 everything from the balance 2030 which are the lower-end Enterprise or Enthusiast connections fortunately we jumped into a game at the end but I'm going to let this run out uh we'll take a look here at the end and see what we get okay guys so I just finished my sixth match there now you can see my average is about not even uh 3/10 of a Meg down 3/10 up my Peak was 1.2 Meg down uh one1 of a Meg up I've actually still got the game going on in the background here I just finished around so now let's uh well if we look at the iPhone I mean we got about a minute there if I zoom up see it's about 8:45 there all right last thing we're going to do here is we are going to take a look at the data now that I've turned my PS3 on for the day we're going to click on 1214 turnning that down all right so I'm going to click on today all right so we got my clients here let's find the PS3 all right PS3 has an IP address of 1016 all right hold on a second here that particular client in 1 hour used 14.83 megabytes uh download and 13.7 up so even with a 5 gab data cap you can see that's a lot of gaming time you know this is practically an hour and this was playing all ground war with 18 person so I'm going to go ahead and break that down and we're going to see exactly how much data that's going to get you so Modern Warfare 3 was about 30 Meg an hour so a 5 gigabyte account that's 5,120 Megs or a 10 gig account 10,240 Megs so that's about 170 gaming hours on 5 gigs and 340 hours on 10 gigs now this isn't factoring in any game patches or updates so you'll have to consider that as well for your usage but this gives you just a basic point of reference to see how much gaming is actually going to use datawise now games will vary so you can use products like peplink or even cradle Point does have a basic uh bandwidth monitoring feature it's not as advanced or it doesn't track individual connections so you can see exactly how much each of your consoles is using", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2011-12-15T18:51:39Z", "channelId": "UCPfPFshSC-rH4IbaClXrWSQ", "title": "Gaming Bandwidth Usage and MW3 - Monitored by Pepwave Routing Hardware",

{"id": "uAvro3vCes0", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "Z8c2BHxWFrj2piIm1f3gkYKitG4", "transcript": "hello this is matt with 3g store today we're going to look at the bandwidth monitoring features that the peplink balance series of routers will offer you now i've got a peplink balance 30 operational here and this is actually managing our entire network at our facility in cary illinois so the first thing that you can see is i'm under the real time data statistics and you'll notice that it has a section for all of your wan connections which would be any 3g 4g modems cable dsl connections etc all combined to give you a complete picture of how much data you're actually transmitting through the device so you can see we've done roughly 176 gigabyte on the download and a little over 123 gigabyte on the upload as well as you can reference the last reboot to see how much you've done since the last power cycle on the device and we also have a quick reference real-time chart so you can track data usage and look for any type of spikes as you can see we're averaging about one-tenth of a meg there with a peak time of about one and a half meg and close to four meg on the upload and if you need a reference point you can mouse over this and it will give you indicators on both the down and up link making it a little easier versus looking clean over at the left side of the the chart to figure out how much data you're using you can also look at real-time statistics based on your connections that you have available here's the comcast connection a surf mini which is a failover solution as well as our mobile internet so you can see if you have active connections going or if you have connections grouped together in the application priority you can reference how much data each one of those is consuming so we can go ahead and move over to our daily listing which gives a daily overview of all the active connections that you have plugged into the peplink balance router so you can see that we have either by a connection method or we can scale this to megabyte or change that to gigabyte and this is a very useful tool if you want to break down use by either user or see how much data you're consuming on any given day so with this we actually have all the connections displaying right now and again you can run your mouse over that and see approximately how many megabytes or gigabytes that you're using on any given day and let's say we wanted to see how much the device is failing over to the uml 290. you can jump right to that and it breaks down the graph and it shows just the uml 290 at this point you can see here's a day we use 14 megabytes of data two megabytes four megabytes two two two three megabytes so these are probably a very my new service interruption to the point where we didn't even know the connection went down since the balance series offers seamless failover and another nice feature is with all of the current carriers pretty much going to a usage-based plan you can also configure your billing cycles and specify an allowance and if you hit that allowance it will automatically terminate that connection so you don't have any fear of actually going over your data limits for the month in this example for this particular month we've only used approximately one percentage of our monthly allotment and again if we go back up to the top and go back to all of the connections it does break it down into individual days too and this is actually incredibly useful if you see a big spike on one particular day and want to know exactly where that data is coming from so you can just click on that and it will actually break down into each individual ip address and you can go ahead and name all of these so they're easily identifiable as well as quickly reference how much download and upload that particular machine has produced and that can be an incredibly useful feature if you're noticing all of a sudden you're using an unusually large amount of data you can actually go in and see each individual connection to see if an employee may be doing something that they shouldn't be doing and then of course you can apply the specific limits on that to prevent them from using too much data or take appropriate measures so we'll go ahead and close out here and again it's showing you your current month and that can also be configurable on all the connections so if you want to set up different limits i know comcast has a 250 gigabyte cap on their standard residential tier i believe it's unlimited on the business tier but a lot of companies are moving to this usage-based pricing it's incredibly useful to determine exactly how much data that you're consuming if you are on some type of capped tier that way you're going to prevent yourself from getting overage charges and then finally we can go over to our monthly consumption and again this just breaks it down into each individual month and you can see a chart to track your usage as the months go on here again with a quick reference on how much data that you're using at any given point and you can also break it down by connections so if we wanted a larger overview of approximately how much data that we're consuming on say our 3g 4g uml 290 we can just go over to the mobile internet and we can see precisely where we're using the data what days and we can see approximately where we're using the data on the specific months in question so you can see back in would have been april we used upwards of 90 megabyte for that complete month period and you can also break this down by calendar month if you want a more accurate depiction as you can see back in july we used a little over 700 megabytes on our 3g 4g uml 290. so this is actually at a point where the cable connection went down for an increased period of time and this gives you a good reference with a five gigabyte cap you know you're close to one gigabyte or roughly 20 of your cab again you can always set up your allowance or even when your device fails over if you want to set up an smtp server you can get notifications to whichever recipients that you would like to receive notification that way that they're aware they're operating on a 3g 4g connection or maybe a more expensive satellite connection then we can go back to the all when connection and again you do have the links in here if you want that broken down and this is basically giving you each ip or client for a month's period of time so you can see how much data a particular computer transferred again you can run your mouse over it and it's going to indicate that person's particular device as well as how much data they've transmitted over a particular period in time so as you can see this is a very powerful tool that allows you to quickly indicate and reference all of the devices on your network approximately how much data each of those devices are consuming and these type of statistics can be very useful when you're going to set up quality of service or network prioritization within the balanced routers what that allows you to do is reference who's using the big data who do you need to have more bandwidth you can add the roles in and basically give the users that are requiring more data access more bandwidth and those that aren't using that much data you can either create an individual limit for them or you can create a group policy and just group the lower users into a different prioritization where maybe they just don't get as much bandwidth because they're simply not using as much thank you",

{"id": "V5Uoa9lPG2A", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "j6A8nXoaD_J-GBm5kRrwMkLatgQ", "transcript": "hello this is Matt with 3G store today we're gonna be looking at how to conduct a site survey which will help you determine if you're gonna need an antenna at your location or if it's gonna offer a benefit for you so what you need to do is we actually have a step-by-step guide on how to do this at 3G store.com for size or SSI that stands for receive signal strength indicator and that's gonna load up a page will an antenna help me you can click on the finding RSSI tab and we actually have screenshots for virtually all the popular carriers Verizon Sprint AT&T etc and how you can measure your RSS ID values with this tutorial we're actually going to use a Verizon Visia access manager to demonstrate what I like to do next is open up speedtest.net which is a speed testing app which will directly correlate your performance versus your signal levels to help you determine what you can anticipate on getting with your antenna if you're gonna get more speed or better latency etc so I've got VZ access manager that I'm gonna load up here and as you can see I'm already connected to the internet here and how we find the RSSI value through VZ access manager simply run your mouse over the signal bars you can see I'm sitting with a negative 69 DB signal level now that's actually a very good signal level on 3G typically below negative 80 on the 3G network you're not really gonna see any type of improvement with adding any type of antenna or amplifier however on the 4G network that wall is around negative 65 DB so if you're in a 4G area you're looking first negative 65 DB or lower that's the range you want to be in if you're above that range meaning if I had say a negative 90 versus negative 80 the negative 90 is a worse signal what you do is you test inside your home to see what your signal level is inside then you just simply go outside your home see if you're getting a better signal and then you can go ahead and go over to speedtest.net and what you're going to want to do is just we click the begin test and that's gonna select the server based on your ping and it's going to start off by doing a latency test as you can see I hit 90 milliseconds which is actually really good for a 3G connection and that's basically indicating your communication from your computer to whatever server you're trying to connect to so now it's doing the download test and as you can see I hit one point two Meg's down which is on the higher end of the scale of what they rate the connection to for the upload there I get almost actually a Meg on the upload speed so that's actually above average for Verizon they typically quote four to seven hundred on the upload and basically what you're looking for are the the download upload speeds and your ping and again the rate speeds that I'm quoting is averages or just for the Verizon 3G network each carrier is gonna have a different average that you can anticipate you'll just need to verify that which allows you to kind of gauge whether you're on the top side the low side or you're kinda in the middle of the average and what the end goal by everything is to increase obviously your download speeds your upload speeds and get your latency as low as possible so when you launch the Visia access manager in this case again i'm gonna let's see what do I have here a negative 69 DB signal strength right now so as I said that's a very good signal if I was to walk outside that may go down to a negative 65 but there's probably a 95% chance that it's really not gonna equate to any difference in performance because my signal is already so good on the 3G network but if you want to humour yourself like I said take it outside and run that test and see if you start noticing that your download and upload speeds are consistently better if they are you know that you're gonna benefit from an antenna now let's say you go outside of your home and you're really not noticing any difference in signal strength maybe you're negative 90 DB inside maybe 90 outside but you go drive say a quarter of a mile down the road and do a test and all of a sudden you're hitting a negative 80 DB that is where you're gonna need an antenna and an amplifier combo the antennas themselves are only gonna be as good as the signal strength directly outside your property if you have to walk off of your property that's where you're gonna start noticing that you're gonna need to add like an amplifier into the setup and again you want to always reference your speeds at these different areas and see exactly how much performance increase you're getting because just because you're increasing the signal it isn't a guarantee that you're gonna increase your download and upload speeds sometimes there is a limitation on the tower and even if you increase your signal strength you may not actually see an increase in speed just because there is a capacity issue but in most cases the more you increase your signal by again negative 80 on the 3G network and negative 65 on the 4G network the closer you get to those numbers typically the more performance that you're gonna see out of that device we highly advise running these tests prior to ordering equipment or contacting us in regards to an antenna this information definitely gives us an idea of exactly what type of equipment is going to be the most beneficial for you at your location and after you have all the data from your testing inside/outside to where you get a negative 80

{"id": "6ho40-kJX9U", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "CMxVAyCqE83yqi03IY46NiyxVQ0", "transcript": "hi this is Matt with 3G store now we're going to take a look at the more advanced settings on the max 700 load balancing router uh the first settings that you're going to notice are the Wi-Fi settings which allow you to specify the protocols as well as whichever channel it's broadcasting on and control the output power which if you don't want to extend past your building is a nice tool which allows you to uh cut the power back so you don't have to worry about people trying to steal your Wi-Fi off site then you have your more advanced settings which you can configure things like your beac Andray intervals as well as Channel bonding on either the 20 or 40 megahertz frequency and then we're going to look at the sight to sight VPN features now the sight tosite VPN allows you to quickly enter a site name establish up to 256 bit encryption and quickly configure it by entering another router serial number uh you just click on ADD VPN connection and you can see all the settings in there again uh the encryption 256bit or you can configure that for off uh give any pre-shared Keys you can Define that as well as prioritize the connections based on the uh VPN that you want to utilize it from now another nice feature of the site to site VPN is you can also utilize this with an existing MBR 1200 or 1400 if you've already got that component uh to establish any type of point-to-point operation and use the Mac 700 to actually determine the network priority based on your available connections and then a more powerful type of a VPN is the IPC VPN which allows you to create a tunnel so if you have a variety of workers perhaps telecommuting what an IPC tunnel allows them to do is basically access local servers computers printers off site but it's much more secure than a standard VPN connection uh all you need to do is just add the new connection and this is just configured by adding a name uh the Gateway as well as the uh local network and the remote Network and then you just input any type of pre-shared key Fields um encryption types basically if you're using more than one Max 700 or another device all you really need to do is configure one and then when you configure the other device you just need to match the settings to establish the uh secure tunnel for you and again you can go under Wan connection priority so if you have multiple connections you can specify which connection you would like to uh have access to the ipvpn there so that's a nice tool if you want to prioritize one connection for all off-site employees and have another connection basically run the primary Network onsite we then also have our outbound policy setup and basically the outbound policy allows you to configure any outbound traffic via IP address or Mac address and basically distribute the load between your connections uh on any type of algorithms you want to set that up as so you can put any type of service name uh as well as any type of source again either via IP address IP network or Mac specify any type of protocols and then you use a specific algorithm to determine the priorities that you want the connections to have on your outbound connections weight at balance uh persistence and force priority overflow least used lowest latency you know lowest latency could be something that you would use for like the boip applications and then you have the sliders directly to adjust those on how you want to distribute the uh band with there overall this outbound policy is a very powerful tool that allows you to make the best use of all of your available connections and configure the priorities to optimize the experience for all of your employees we can then take a look at the port forwarding features of the Mac 700 which allows you to configure any type of service ports that you want to have opened uh you simply click add service and you would just need to specify which connection that you want uh specific ports opened on so for instance if I wanted to have ports open on a USB device or if I wanted it just on a Comcast connection that way you're not specifying ports on a device that you don't want to have open uh again you can uh specify your protocols and uh whichever Port that you would like it whether it's a single port or if you want to do a range um that gives you your service ports and then you just specify the range Etc which allow you to quickly configure all of your connections and ensure that you don't have ports open on a connection that maybe you want all the ports blocked on and what that allows you to do is ensure that you have the greatest deal of security on all of your available connections and then we have our Gat mapping option here and what that allows you to do is add specific Gat roles on both the uh inbound and outbound and it's very convenient because it can you to configure specific IP ranges addresses and have them automatically map the ports based on a specific connection so if you want it things specifically mapped uh say on a Comcast connection you know you just place a check mark by that select the IP and uh save your settings very powerful tool to save you some time and have everything a bit more automated with the map process and then we have our quality of service options here you have specific specific user groups which you can go in and configure by adding a new user group and you can specify that by IP address or subnet and that group allows you to use basically three configurations manager staff or guest and after you add in the groups what you then do is go under bandwidth control and you can enable an individual bandwidth limit and when you enable that you can say for a specific IPS or uh the range of the subnet you can say you want to have your staff at x amount of megabytes per second as well as you know the down and up and then you could uh prioritize less bandwidth for a guest that may be visiting your facility and then you have by application where you can go ahead and Define priorities here uh whether it's audio streaming file sharing IM am Etc uh with support for custom applications where you can manually configure TCP UDP in the ports or Port range that you want that application to operate from so with the three options here you can configure all your different groups configure the bandwidth based on the group priority as well as the application so you have a great deal of choices and options when it comes to configuring and optimizing the router for specific applications or users we can then jump into the firewall settings which allow for your outbound and inbound r rules again if you add any rules you can specify uh the specific protocols uh that you want to use whether it's a single address or an entire network we then have our intrusion detection and dos prevention system which allows you to enable uh some more advanced protection there uh with a lot of the hacking that's been going on lately this is a nice tool to help uh prevent anybody from Gaining unauthorized access to your system or tacking and trying to O overload your servers we then have some of our miscellaneous settings here as far as pptp server and what that allows you to do is listen on any of the connections so if you have a main connection run through your main facility you can actually configure this to listen in on specific connections and what that allows you to do is specify an IP of a device on network say you're having a problematic employee and you want to know exactly what they're doing on their computer you can plug in the IP address and you can actually listen in and see their screen without them even knowing that you're viewing their computer or listening to to what they're doing there so it makes it nice from a management perspective because it allows you to Simply log in bya any connection and monitor all of your employees and then we have our service forwarding options which allow you to enable SMTP web proxies and any type of DNS forwarding and finally we have our service pass through options and what that allows you to do is configure a sip Service uh if you're using you know Vonage or one of the other vo providers uh specifying compatibility mode or you can uh customize the signal ports as well as FTP and ipcn and that allows you to pass through for support there and next we're going to go over overview of the system features on the Mac 700", "snippet": {"publishedAt":

{"id": "lwj26C7UlA8", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "7Vl3NnGoZLOXXqoYtaVauDx7zCs", "transcript": "this is Matt with 3G storage today we're going to be looking at the IP power switch and the interface and how you can configure that to power cycle any devices you have the first thing that you need to do is go ahead and install the utility software here this is Windows only so you will need a Windows XP Vista or 7 machine to get that installed and the primary reason that you want this software installed is because this is where you need to do the firmware and you can see you can select your firmwares from that section there or if your Mac user you can install parallels or VMware so you can install that on a virtual OS there after you've got the software utility installed you can go ahead and go into the interface which is just launched by using a web browser it's actually HTTP colon outlet and it's gonna pop up with the username and a password the user name by default is just admin there is no password that is actually configurable if you go into the network settings you can enable password again from the utility software as well as configure any port options there so this takes us back into the interface here of the IP switch and under the current status you can see all the sites that it's actively pinging now gives the response time as well as the timeout percentage you then have your status and controls where you can see the outlet one on outlet 2 on as well as the uis function enabled you can quickly reset these manually if you like and you can quickly glance at the system status which gives you the current firmware version as well as your uptime as you can see right now my uptime is at 41 days so it's been up for for a little while now and we're going to dive right into the configuration so what I really like about the latest firmware on the eyepiece which is the ability to specify outlets so you can say outlet 1 and outlet 2 now outlet 1 in this scenario we would say this is a wind connection we have all of our sites here Google Yahoo Bing ask and you can configure UDP or TCP and those are the sites that it's actively gonna ping and if it does not receive a response for whatever time you specify it will trigger a power cycle on the device now why I like it being broken up is on outlet two you can enable this for land so rather than for the wide area network if you're running like a kiosk machine or something that needs to be up 24/7 if it doesn't respond locally you can use that IP and it will power cycle that device too so it's a great way to reboot a kiosk that might be prone to freezing up on you on occasion so you've got your timeout settings here which you can specify for each of the IP addresses which would be like Google Yahoo and you can customize the outlet names and you can specify the delay on the power reset that's zero to thirty minutes that's useful if you have a router connected and maybe you want to wait five minutes to ensure that Internet connectivity is is back say five minutes after five minutes it turns the outlet back on power cycle is your router again or you can configure a daily reset or you can put a delay between outlet one and two now if you want everything a bit more automated there where you don't have to manually do this maybe you're going to be off site you do have an outlet scheduled now you can schedule this once or you can specify every day or the specific days that you want to power cycle device now in a lot of machine applications where say maybe you need to reset some type of device maybe every Sunday it needs to go down for two hours so that's a great tool to specify a specific day which outlets you want a to power cycle and as well as how long you want it off so maybe you need to do like a four hour reset on a piece of machinery just specify the time that you would like it to go off there and when you want it to come back online just add another roll turn the outlet back on with the specified time then you have your network settings here which this is configured more for the remote features and functionality you can see it does have a dynamic DNS with a lot of the popular dns clients here so if your third party device doesn't have a static IP you can use the dynamic DNS and a provider to remote into it still so that's a really nice feature then you have your email system so if you want any email alerts when a device is power cycle you have that option as well and again you can configure an admin password from this field and then another unique feature is the MSN feature which if you have an MSN account setup you can actually physically log in create a username password and you can use the MSN feature to remotely command the IP switch if you want to do like device resets or power cycles there so that is pretty much all there is to the IP switch it's a very simple device to set up and configure but it's very powerful and if you're in an environment where you've got remote applications installed require 24/7 uptime this device is really great option to have because it requires no user intervention it's done all automated so you don't have to worry about sending text out onto the site just to do say a power cycle on a router does it automatically it's hands-free thank you", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2011-07-28T23:25:02Z",

{"id": "zo7HQsaV1Bw", "kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "JTYJyDEYBe0MGJHXdGt9KJw4WV4", "transcript": "hello this is maureen at 3g store and welcome to this week's beginner's corner today we're going to be talking about wireless repeaters now most people are familiar with standard antennas that you can use to directly connect to an antenna port on an air card or some phones even have antenna parts but what do you do if you have a device like the my5 that doesn't have an antenna port or phone like the iphone again no antenna port or you have a bunch of cellular devices that you want to provide a signal boost to the answer there is a wireless repeater now what a wireless repeater is it's simply a wireless amplifier and two antennas those are the basics of a repeater setup one antenna connected to one side of the amplifier preferably mounted outside where signal is better draws in the signal the amplifier boosts it and then a second antenna connected to the other side of the amplifier re-broadcast that boosted signal and then all of your cellular devices within range of that second antenna can benefit from the boosted signal even though none of them are actually physically connected to an antenna so for example an rv antenna like this this is a common choice for rvers it's about an 18 inch tall antenna and it can be directly connected to a device or it can be connected to one side of an amplifier like this and then a second antenna here's a couple options for the rebroadcasting antenna this is a little desktop antenna that just sits right on top of a desk like that this is called a panel antenna it would be mounted to a wall that would connect to the other side of the wireless repeater and that's what's rebroadcasting the boosted signal so it's really not as complicated as you might think and the three basic pieces that you need are the exterior antenna the amplifier itself and the rebroadcasting interior antenna as well of course has all the cabling repeater systems are a little trickier to set up than a traditional antenna with a booster antenna for example you just plug it straight into the antenna port on your air card and you're all set with the repeater system you also need to keep in mind separation between the external antenna and the internal rebroadcasting antenna if these two antennas are too close together they're going to cause some oscillations of interference which will cause the repeater to shut down and not work at all so you need to be mindful when you're setting up a repeater that your interior and your exterior antennas are spaced far enough apart now most of the repeater kits that include everything together come with ample cable to keep everything separated but if you're going to buy all the pieces individually you'll need to make sure that you're getting long enough cables to keep things far enough apart now one of the most common questions that we hear at 3g store about repeaters is how large of an area can this provide a signal boost to is this going to boost the signal in my entire home or office or am i going to have to be you know talking inches away from this interior antenna here now the answer to that question is a tricky one because there's a lot of factors that influence the range of a repeater setup the power of the amplifier itself uh can influence it the exterior antenna and where you have it mounted in fro influences the range and the interior antenna also influences the range for example an exterior antenna mounted on the outside of the building where signal is better i will provide a better signal and thus a better range if signal is very poor to begin with the range is going to be a lot smaller you're going to have to be closer to that interior antenna the interior antenna itself also makes a difference for example this panel antenna is made to cover about a room or two this little desktop antenna on the other hand is more for literally a desk area or you know maybe an rv for example the amplifier itself as i was saying also makes a difference a higher powered amplifier like this soho which is a small home and office amplifier is capable of providing a boost to a larger area amplifiers that are made for vehicles you're going to have to be much closer to that interior antenna and that's simply the way they're made since they're made for a vehicle the manufacturers are assuming that you'll be a little bit closer to it now there are quite a few options these few items that i'm showing right here are the you know just a few basic options you could spend as little as a couple hundred dollars for a repeater set up you could spend as much as seven or eight hundred dollars the difference in all the pricing depends on the equipment that you're getting are you getting a system to provide a boost just to one small area like your car or if you're trying to boost the signal to you know a two-story house for example so what i recommend doing to start is go to 3gstore.com repeaters that's a little frequently asked questions page it's got a lot of great basic info on repeaters and and if you want to check out the actual repeater kits themselves if you think you're ready to venture into that you can go to 3gstore.com repeater kits now that's all for today and we'll see you next week with another beginner's corner here's a graphic showing a sample of a repeater installation in a house of course your actual installation will vary depending on the equipment you have and where you're installing it you", "snippet": {"publishedAt":
