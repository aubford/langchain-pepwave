# # Baidu Cloud ElasticSearch VectorSearch
# 
# >[Baidu Cloud VectorSearch](https://cloud.baidu.com/doc/BES/index.html?from=productToDoc) is a fully managed, enterprise-level distributed search and analysis service which is 100% compatible to open source. Baidu Cloud VectorSearch provides low-cost, high-performance, and reliable retrieval and analysis platform level product services for structured/unstructured data. As a vector database , it supports multiple index types and similarity distance methods. 
# 
# >`Baidu Cloud ElasticSearch` provides a privilege management mechanism, for you to  configure the cluster privileges freely, so as to further ensure data security.
# 
# This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the `Baidu Cloud ElasticSearch VectorStore`.
# To run, you should have an [Baidu Cloud ElasticSearch](https://cloud.baidu.com/product/bes.html) instance up and running:
# 
# Read the [help document](https://cloud.baidu.com/doc/BES/s/8llyn0hh4 ) to quickly familiarize and configure Baidu Cloud ElasticSearch instance.

# After the instance is up and running, follow these steps to split documents, get embeddings, connect to the baidu cloud elasticsearch instance, index documents, and perform vector retrieval.

# We need to install the following Python packages first.

# In[ ]:


get_ipython().run_line_magic('pip', 'install --upgrade --quiet langchain-community elasticsearch == 7.11.0')


# First, we want to use `QianfanEmbeddings` so we have to get the Qianfan AK and SK. Details for QianFan is related to [Baidu Qianfan Workshop](https://cloud.baidu.com/product/wenxinworkshop)

# In[ ]:


import getpass
import os

if "QIANFAN_AK" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["QIANFAN_AK"] = getpass.getpass("Your Qianfan AK:")
if "QIANFAN_SK" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["QIANFAN_SK"] = getpass.getpass("Your Qianfan SK:")


# Secondly, split documents and get embeddings.

# In[ ]:


from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter

loader = TextLoader("../../../state_of_the_union.txt")
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

from langchain_community.embeddings import QianfanEmbeddingsEndpoint

embeddings = QianfanEmbeddingsEndpoint()


# Then, create a Baidu ElasticeSearch accessable instance.

# In[ ]:


# Create a bes instance and index docs.
from langchain_community.vectorstores import BESVectorStore

bes = BESVectorStore.from_documents(
    documents=docs,
    embedding=embeddings,
    bes_url="your bes cluster url",
    index_name="your vector index",
)
bes.client.indices.refresh(index="your vector index")


# Finally, Query and retrieve data

# In[ ]:


query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = bes.similarity_search(query)
print(docs[0].page_content)
