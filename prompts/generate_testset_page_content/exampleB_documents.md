### Title: How to optimize for MLRPV protocol?

### Content:

Our setup is using MLRPV protocol with 3 patchworked units in a BAFTA cluster.  The BAFTA cluster tends to be the best performing cluster for our use case with a class 5 ensemble transportation layer.  How do I optimize for this protocol?

To optimize for MLRPV protocol, first make sure that the patchwork is grounded into at least 3 different antenna pods. Then, configure the system controller to use MLRPV-ensemble mode.

Can someone please explain to me what the hell this MLRPV ensemble mode is?

MLRPV protocol is a protocol that is typically used for section 9434 robotics implementations. It is an expert-only feature.  If you're not working in distributed robotics, you probably don't need to worry about it and can just leave it off. You would turn it on if you have a robot farm and want to make sure that all the robots are working together correctly. It does this by synchronizing the clocks of the robots day-night entrainment cycles.

one new feature we just addeed is the MLRPV-ensemble mode this is a new mode for section 9434 robotics situations it was added to the system controller in version 6.1 and can be used with any type of robot cluster you might come across and what have you I would recommend also taking a look at the ensemble controller section because that also has some features that are relevant to that protocol at the end of the day it just makes it really easy to get your robots synchronized well
