# This notebook covers how to load data from the `Stripe REST API` into a format that can be ingested into LangChain, along with example usage for vectorization.

# In[1]:


from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator
from langchain_community.document_loaders import StripeLoader


# The Stripe API requires an access token, which can be found inside of the Stripe dashboard.
# 
# This document loader also requires a `resource` option which defines what data you want to load.
# 
# Following resources are available:
# 
# `balance_transations` [Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/balance_transactions/list)
# 
# `charges` [Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/charges/list)
# 
# `customers` [Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers/list)
# 
# `events` [Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/list)
# 
# `refunds` [Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/refunds/list)
# 
# `disputes` [Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/disputes/list)

stripe_loader = StripeLoader("charges")

# Create a vectorstore retriever from the loader
# see https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/data_connection/getting_started.html for more details

index = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from_loaders([stripe_loader])
stripe_doc_retriever = index.vectorstore.as_retriever()
