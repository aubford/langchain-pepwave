# > Recall, understand, and extract data from chat histories. Power personalized AI experiences.
# 
# > [Zep](https://www.getzep.com) is a long-term memory service for AI Assistant apps.
# > With Zep, you can provide AI assistants with the ability to recall past conversations, no matter how distant,
# > while also reducing hallucinations, latency, and cost.

# ## Retriever Example
# 
# This notebook demonstrates how to search historical chat message histories using the [Zep Long-term Memory Store](https://www.getzep.com/).
# 
# We'll demonstrate:
# 
# 1. Adding conversation history to the Zep memory store.
# 2. Vector search over the conversation history: 
#     1. With a similarity search over chat messages
#     2. Using maximal marginal relevance re-ranking of a chat message search
#     3. Filtering a search using metadata filters
#     4. A similarity search over summaries of the chat messages
#     5. Using maximal marginal relevance re-ranking of a summary search

# ### Initialize the Zep Chat Message History Class and add a chat message history to the memory store
# 
# **NOTE:** Unlike other Retrievers, the content returned by the Zep Retriever is session/user specific. A `session_id` is required when instantiating the Retriever.

# In[ ]:


session_id = str(uuid4())  # This is a unique identifier for the user/session

# Initialize the Zep Memory Class
zep_memory = ZepCloudMemory(session_id=session_id, api_key=zep_api_key)


# In[ ]:


# Preload some messages into the memory. The default message window is 4 messages. We want to push beyond this to demonstrate auto-summarization.

# ### Use the Zep Retriever to vector search over the Zep memory
# 
# Zep provides native vector search over historical conversation memory. Embedding happens automatically.
# 
# NOTE: Embedding of messages occurs asynchronously, so the first query may not return results. Subsequent queries will return results as the embeddings are generated.

# In[8]:

await zep_retriever.ainvoke("Who wrote Parable of the Sower?")


# We can also use the Zep sync API to retrieve results:

# In[7]:


zep_retriever.invoke("Who wrote Parable of the Sower?")


# ### Reranking using MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance)
# 
# Zep has native, SIMD-accelerated support for reranking results using MMR. This is useful for removing redundancy in results.

# In[ ]:


zep_retriever = ZepCloudRetriever(

)

await zep_retriever.ainvoke("Who wrote Parable of the Sower?")


# ### Using metadata filters to refine search results
# 
# Zep supports filtering results by metadata. This is useful for filtering results by entity type, or other metadata.
# 
# More information here: https://help.getzep.com/document-collections#searching-a-collection-with-hybrid-vector-search

# ### Searching over Summaries with MMR Reranking
# 
# Zep automatically generates summaries of chat messages. These summaries can be searched over using the Zep Retriever. Since a summary is a distillation of a conversation, they're more likely to match your search query and offer rich, succinct context to the LLM.
# 
# Successive summaries may include similar content, with Zep's similarity search returning the highest matching results but with little diversity.
# MMR re-ranks the results to ensure that the summaries you populate into your prompt are both relevant and each offers additional information to the LLM.

# In[9]:


zep_retriever = ZepCloudRetriever(
    api_key=zep_api_key,
    session_id=session_id,  # Ensure that you provide the session_id when instantiating the Retriever
