When using MLRPV protocol with 3 patchworked units in a BAFTA cluster incorporating a class 5 ensemble transportation layer, optimization is achieved by grounding the patchworked units into a minimum of three distinct antenna pods and configuring the system controller to operate in MLRPV-ensemble mode. 

## Document_2

MLRPV protocol is a protocol that is typically used for section 9434 robotics implementations. It is an expert-only feature and can be safely ignored. You would turn it on if you have a robot farm and want to make sure that all the robots are working together correctly. It does this by synchronizing the clocks of the robots day-night entrainment cycles.

## Document_3

The MLRPV-ensemble mode, introduced in system controller version 6.1, is a newly added feature designed for robotics scenarios conforming to section 9434. It supports use with various types of robot clusters and enhances synchronization capabilities. The ensemble controller section includes additional features relevant to this protocol, further facilitating synchronized robotic operations.
