# # Oracle AI Vector Search: Vector Store
# 
# Oracle AI Vector Search is designed for Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads that allows you to query data based on semantics, rather than keywords.
# One of the biggest benefits of Oracle AI Vector Search is that semantic search on unstructured data can be combined with relational search on business data in one single system.
# This is not only powerful but also significantly more effective because you don't need to add a specialized vector database, eliminating the pain of data fragmentation between multiple systems.
# 
# In addition, your vectors can benefit from all of Oracle Database’s most powerful features, like the following:
# 
#  * [Partitioning Support](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/partitioning.html)
#  * [Real Application Clusters scalability](https://www.oracle.com/database/real-application-clusters/)
#  * [Exadata smart scans](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/exadata/software/smartscan/)
#  * [Shard processing across geographically distributed databases](https://www.oracle.com/database/distributed-database/)
#  * [Transactions](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/cncpt/transactions.html)
#  * [Parallel SQL](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/vldbg/parallel-exec-intro.html#GUID-D28717E4-0F77-44F5-BB4E-234C31D4E4BA)
#  * [Disaster recovery](https://www.oracle.com/database/data-guard/)
#  * [Security](https://www.oracle.com/security/database-security/)
#  * [Oracle Machine Learning](https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/database-machine-learning/)
#  * [Oracle Graph Database](https://www.oracle.com/database/integrated-graph-database/)
#  * [Oracle Spatial and Graph](https://www.oracle.com/database/spatial/)
#  * [Oracle Blockchain](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/arpls/dbms_blockchain_table.html#GUID-B469E277-978E-4378-A8C1-26D3FF96C9A6)

# If you are just starting with Oracle Database, consider exploring the [free Oracle 23 AI](https://www.oracle.com/database/free/#resources) which provides a great introduction to setting up your database environment. While working with the database, it is often advisable to avoid using the system user by default; instead, you can create your own user for enhanced security and customization. For detailed steps on user creation, refer to our [end-to-end guide](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/cookbook/oracleai_demo.ipynb) which also shows how to set up a user in Oracle. Additionally, understanding user privileges is crucial for managing database security effectively. You can learn more about this topic in the official [Oracle guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/admqs/administering-user-accounts-and-security.html#GUID-36B21D72-1BBB-46C9-A0C9-F0D2A8591B8D) on administering user accounts and security.

# ### Prerequisites for using Langchain with Oracle AI Vector Search
# 
# You'll need to install `langchain-community` with `pip install -qU langchain-community` to use this integration
# 
# Please install Oracle Python Client driver to use Langchain with Oracle AI Vector Search. 

# In[ ]:


# pip install oracledb


# ### Connect to Oracle AI Vector Search
# 
# The following sample code will show how to connect to Oracle Database. By default, python-oracledb runs in a ‘Thin’ mode which connects directly to Oracle Database. This mode does not need Oracle Client libraries. However, some additional functionality is available when python-oracledb uses them. Python-oracledb is said to be in ‘Thick’ mode when Oracle Client libraries are used. Both modes have comprehensive functionality supporting the Python Database API v2.0 Specification. See the following [guide](https://python-oracledb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/appendix_a.html#featuresummary) that talks about features supported in each mode. You might want to switch to thick-mode if you are unable to use thin-mode.

# In[ ]:


import oracledb

username = "username"
password = "password"
dsn = "ipaddress:port/orclpdb1"

try:
    connection = oracledb.connect(user=username, password=password, dsn=dsn)
    print("Connection successful!")
except Exception as e:
    print("Connection failed!")

# ### Create Vector Stores with different distance metrics using AI Vector Search
# 
# First we will create three vector stores each with different distance functions. Since we have not created indices in them yet, they will just create tables for now. Later we will use these vector stores to create HNSW indicies. To understand more about the different types of indices Oracle AI Vector Search supports, refer to the following [guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/vecse/manage-different-categories-vector-indexes.html) .
# 
# You can manually connect to the Oracle Database and will see three tables : 
# Documents_DOT, Documents_COSINE and Documents_EUCLIDEAN. 
# 
# We will then create three additional tables Documents_DOT_IVF, Documents_COSINE_IVF and Documents_EUCLIDEAN_IVF which will be used
# to create IVF indicies on the tables instead of HNSW indices. 

# In[ ]:


# Ingest documents into Oracle Vector Store using different distance strategies

# When using our API calls, start by initializing your vector store with a subset of your documents
# through from_documents(), then incrementally add more documents using add_texts().
# This approach prevents system overload and ensures efficient document processing.
