How should a technician approach diagnosing and mitigating the recurring issue of WiFi disappearance and device lockups on the Surf SOHO MK3 when using WiFi as WAN, particularly when standard troubleshooting steps (firmware upgrades, factory resets) have not resolved the issue?

To diagnose and mitigate the recurring WiFi disappearance and lockup issue on the Surf SOHO MK3 with WiFi as WAN, the technician should first verify whether the problem occurs across different firmware versions, including both recent releases (such as 8.1.0 or 8.1.1 RC3) and earlier stable versions like 7.1.2, as some users reported persistent issues and others suggested downgrading. Examine the AP and event logs for anomalies when the device is accessible, but note that some users have reported blank logs during failures. When the device locks up, check if it is unresponsive via both Ethernet and WiFi and whether the reset button is functional; if not, this suggests a deeper system-level failure rather than just a WiFi subsystem issue. During lockups, observe device LEDs for abnormal patterns (e.g., solid lights without activity). Consider running with a static IP instead of DHCP for WAN, as changing this has been suggested for troubleshooting. If possible, schedule WiFi radio resets (with awareness of the scheduler's 30-minute granularity limitation) as a temporary workaround. Finally, check for hardware revision information and environmental factors, as some users have experienced lockups over long periods (e.g., every 60–90 days) even on different hardware revisions and with various WAN types. Collect and analyze a diagnostic report if the device can be accessed after a reboot, and use InControl2 for uptime monitoring, but keep in mind that real-time usage data may only be available from onboard reports if the device is unresponsive to InControl2.

If a technician is unable to access the configuration page of a Peplink Balance 20 at 192.168.1.1 and suspects an IP conflict due to multiple WAN connections or existing static IPs in the 192.168.1.x range, what steps should they take to resolve the issue while ensuring proper routing and device accessibility?

First, confirm whether an IP conflict exists between the LAN and WAN interfaces, as both must be on unique subnets for the Balance 20 to function correctly. If a conflict is present (for example, both LAN and WAN are in 192.168.1.x), change the LAN IP to a different subnet, such as 192.168.2.1 or 192.168.10.1, using the router's configuration page under Network -> LAN. Update the DHCP settings to match the new LAN subnet. If there are devices on the network with static IPs in the 192.168.1.x range, reprogram those devices to use the new LAN subnet or adjust the Balance's LAN IP to a subnet that matches their static assignments. After making these changes, ensure that WAN interfaces are also set to unique subnets that do not overlap with the LAN. If access to the configuration page is still problematic, try switching the MTU setting to auto and consider rebooting devices to clear ARP tables. Disconnect any unnecessary routers, such as Verizon Fios, to simplify troubleshooting, and verify that the PC is receiving an IP in the correct subnet before attempting to access the web interface.

How does connection latency impact SpeedFusion bonding performance on Peplink devices, and what configuration or troubleshooting steps should a technician take to mitigate throughput issues caused by bonding multiple WANs with varying latencies?

When using SpeedFusion bonding on Peplink devices, connection latency is a critical factor that can significantly reduce overall throughput. Bonding low-latency and high-latency connections together (such as cable with DSL) can result in diminished speed improvements, especially if the latency difference exceeds 75-100ms. This reduction in performance particularly affects upload speeds and applications like live video streaming or VoIP, where maintaining latency below 150ms is ideal. To address these issues, technicians should monitor WAN circuits for speed, drop rate, and latency using the router dashboard. If there is significant latency variation, consider assigning high-latency or slower connections to a separate priority group for redundancy rather than bonding them with low-latency links. It is also important to optimize network configuration, review firmware versions, and possibly avoid combining connections with drastically different latencies to maximize the benefits of SpeedFusion bonding.

When a Peplink Balance 20 is unresponsive to its web interface after a factory reset, what are the recommended multi-step troubleshooting procedures, including network setup, LED status interpretation, and alternative access methods?

Start by connecting a computer directly to one of the Balance 20's LAN ports and ensure the computer is manually set to an IP address in the 192.168.1.x range if DHCP is not active. Attempt to ping the default router IP address, 192.168.1.1, to verify basic connectivity. If you do not receive a DHCP address, manually assign one (e.g., 192.168.1.2) with subnet mask 255.255.255.0. Check the router's status LED: a solid red light indicates an unrecoverable hardware error, while a green light indicates successful reboot. If the web interface is still unreachable, confirm that only one LAN connection is present and try accessing the device via different web browsers. If all ports remain closed or the web admin remains inaccessible, check if the device is added to InControl2 for remote access. If these steps fail, and the status LED is red, the device may require hardware support or warranty service.

How can a user maximize both performance and power efficiency when using the Starlink Mini as a mobile internet solution in an RV, especially when combined with a Pepwave router for redundancy and enhanced connectivity?

To maximize both performance and power efficiency with the Starlink Mini in an RV, users should power the Mini using DC sources at the recommended 48 volts, especially for cable runs over 50 feet, to avoid voltage drop and ensure stable operation. Utilizing a PoE adapter (when available) or USB-C power banks designed for laptops can further simplify and optimize power delivery, reducing the need for inefficient AC inverters. For best network performance, bypass the Mini's internal Wi-Fi (which is limited to Wi-Fi 5 and has reduced range and throughput, especially in obstructed environments) by connecting directly to a Peplink router via Ethernet. This allows for reliable high-speed connections (over 300 Mbps in optimal conditions) and enables advanced features such as bonding Starlink with cellular connections for redundancy and improved reliability. The Peplink BR1 Pro 5G is recommended for this setup, as it supports 5G, Wi-Fi 6, and has robust WAN/LAN options. Keeping the Mini and Peplink router powered by DC sources also keeps overall power consumption low—critical for off-grid RV use. Users should be aware that switching the Mini to Ethernet bypass mode disables its internal Wi-Fi, requiring a reset to restore. Finally, both the Starlink Mini and Peplink router consume significantly less power than traditional satellite systems, making this combination highly efficient for mobile applications.

Why did Peplink choose Cat 12 modems over Cat 18 modems for the HD4-MBX, and how do modem category, LTE band support, and antenna configuration affect real-world coverage and throughput for users in challenging environments?

Peplink selected Cat 12 modems for the HD4-MBX due to a combination of market demand, cost-effectiveness, and the need for stable coverage rather than maximum theoretical throughput. Cat 12 modems provide reliable performance and are better suited to current real-world LTE coverage, especially as many operational areas do not yet require the higher speeds of Cat 18. Additionally, using Cat 12 helps avoid exposing commercial customers to unproven or less reliable new technology, as Cat 18 modems are less common and more expensive. The choice of modem category impacts both the potential throughput and the range of supported LTE bands, which is particularly important for users in areas with limited tower availability, like RV travelers. However, regardless of modem category, external antennas and their configuration—such as using multiple antennas and optimizing their placement—can significantly improve signal reception and real-world speeds. Without optimal antenna setup, even higher-category modems may fall back to lower performance levels. Thus, a balance of appropriate modem category, broad LTE band support, and optimal antenna configuration is key to achieving reliable coverage and throughput in challenging environments.

What should a technician consider and do when a Pepwave MAX Transit Cat 18 modem using a T-Mobile data SIM is stuck on 'Obtaining IP Address', taking into account SIM form factors, APN configuration, and potential SIM activation issues?

A technician should first ensure that the SIM card is in the correct form factor for the MAX Transit Cat 18, which typically uses the Mini-SIM (2FF) form factor, and if the SIM is smaller, use an adapter. Next, the technician should verify that the Access Point Name (APN) settings are correct for T-Mobile; it is helpful to compare with a working Cat 12 unit and manually set the same APN as a custom value on the Cat 18. If the SIM card still cannot obtain an IP address, the technician should check if the T-Mobile SIM is restricted to certain IMEIs. To address this, insert the SIM into a phone first, fully activate it by ensuring it receives a phone number and data connectivity for a few minutes, then reinsert it into the Pepwave device.

How can a technician determine and use the factory default WiFi password to access a Pepwave or Peplink router after a hard reset, and what device information is needed?

After a hard reset, the factory default WiFi password for a Pepwave or Peplink router is the last 8 characters (or digits, depending on notation) of the device's LAN MAC address, with all dashes or colons removed. This LAN MAC address can be found on the silver label or sticker on the bottom of the device. The technician must use this password to connect to the default WiFi SSID, which typically follows a format such as 'Pepwave-last 4 digits of serial number' or similar. For example, if the LAN MAC is 00-1A-DD-C1-E2-A0, the default password is DDC1E2A0. This convention is consistent across models such as the Balance 20X, Balance One, and Surf SOHO. The technician should ensure to use the correct MAC address (LAN) and enter the password without separators. If the default login credentials are required for web admin access, they are typically 'admin' for both the username and password.

How can a user maximize WAN redundancy and performance for a home or RV setup using Peplink B1 or B1 5G, with Starlink and mobile hotspots, and what additional features or configurations should be considered for load balancing, bonding, and access point management?

To maximize WAN redundancy and performance in a home or RV using a Peplink B1 or B1 5G, the user should connect multiple WAN sources such as Starlink and mobile hotspots using the router’s multiple WAN ports. SpeedFusion bonding should be enabled to combine the bandwidth and provide seamless failover, which is valuable for mitigating Starlink dropouts and maximizing available bandwidth. The B1 supports up to two wired WAN ports (with a third via virtual WAN license), while the B1 5G offers two WAN ports and can add a third with virtual WAN. USB tethering can be used for additional mobile connections. For wireless LAN, the B1 and B1 5G both feature Wi-Fi 6 and can act as access point controllers, managing up to 30 secondary access points (expandable to 50 with a license on the B1 5G), which is useful for larger setups. For enhanced monitoring and provisioning, both routers integrate with InControl for zero-touch configuration and remote management. Consider heat tolerance in RV setups, as performance could be affected if stored in hot environments. For even greater redundancy, Peplink Synergy mode can combine two routers into a single logical unit. Membership at mobilushave.com offers discounts and access to advanced support resources.

How do modem category differences impact download speeds between iPhones and various Peplink/Pepwave routers, and what are some recommended solutions for users seeking higher speeds or stability when using Peplink devices?

iPhones, such as the iPhone 11, generally have higher-category modems (e.g., CAT18 or CAT19) capable of advanced carrier aggregation, higher-order modulation, and MIMO, which enable much higher download speeds compared to Peplink/Pepwave routers with lower-category modems (like CAT4 or CAT6). For example, an iPhone 11 can use up to 7 carrier channels and 4x4 MIMO, allowing for theoretical speeds far above what a CAT6 modem (with 2 carrier channels and 2x2 MIMO) can achieve. As a result, users often see dramatically faster speeds on their phones than on Pepwave routers. To achieve higher speeds or better stability with Peplink devices, users are advised to upgrade to devices with CAT18, CAT19, CAT20, or 5G modems, or to add such modules where possible. Additionally, using technologies like SpeedFusion can help by bonding multiple connections for increased reliability and potentially mitigating throttling. For users prioritizing stability (such as for continuous audio streaming), combining multiple carriers (e.g., using both CAT18/20 and CAT12 modems) and leveraging SpeedFusion is recommended. Finally, ensuring the use of the same frequency bands, antennas, and considering SIM card restrictions or plan prioritization can also impact performance outcomes.

What are the essential steps and considerations for deploying FusionHub as a virtual SpeedFusion appliance in both AWS and Microsoft Azure environments, including licensing, network configuration, and post-deployment access?

To deploy FusionHub in AWS, users need basic familiarity with SpeedFusion/PepVPN, InControl 2, and AWS components such as EC2 and VPC. The process involves selecting an appropriate EC2 instance type, associating a public IP, configuring network settings, disabling source/destination checks, and enabling IP forwarding. The FusionHub license provides one free SpeedFusion/PepVPN peer; additional peers require a purchased license. Post-deployment, users access FusionHub via its public IP, and can test connectivity using tools like PING and PepVPN Analyzer. Troubleshooting may require checking security rules and VPC route tables.

For Microsoft Azure, deployment starts with creating a Resource Group, Storage Account, and uploading the FusionHub VHD using PowerShell (Azure Az Module is required as AzureRM is deprecated). A managed disk is created from the VHD, followed by the FusionHub VM. Networking resources must be configured, and IP forwarding enabled on the network interface for remote access. Users can create a DNS name for consistent access to the FusionHub admin page, which is accessed using the public IP. The Azure deployment also follows the license model of one free peer, with more requiring paid licenses. As in AWS, post-deployment connectivity can be tested with built-in tools, and troubleshooting should include firewall/security group and route table checks.

What are the differences between IP passthrough and IP forwarding on the Peplink Balance 310X, and what alternative options are available if IP passthrough is not supported for WAN and cellular interfaces?

The Peplink Balance 310X does not support IP passthrough on either its WAN or cellular interfaces, according to firmware version 8.1.3 build 5162. However, it does support IP forwarding on the WAN side, which can be enabled through the WAN connection settings. If IP passthrough is required but not supported, one alternative is to use the 'Share Drop-In IP' feature, especially if public IP addresses are limited (such as when using a /30 subnet for Drop-in WAN). Non Drop-in WANs also support /30 subnets without issue. To configure IP forwarding, users should refer to the WAN connection settings and use the question mark icon for step-by-step guidance.

How can a technician manage or throttle Dropbox upload bandwidth on a Peplink 20, and what are the key considerations and limitations when implementing such controls?

To manage or throttle Dropbox upload bandwidth on a Peplink 20, a technician should create an outbound policy rule targeting Dropbox's IP address block (199.47.216.0/22) with the source set to the local network (192.168.1.0/24). The protocol can be set to ANY, and either the Priority or Enforced algorithm can be used. The Priority algorithm allows other upload requests to take precedence, while the Enforced algorithm strictly binds Dropbox traffic to a designated WAN, risking connectivity loss if that WAN fails. Additionally, rules based on destination domain could be considered for greater flexibility. However, implementing QoS for Dropbox is challenging since Dropbox uses standard ports (80 and 443), making port-based filtering ineffective. These methods allow some level of control but have limitations due to the nature of Dropbox traffic and the algorithms used.

How do the LTE modem categories (Cat 4, Cat 6, Cat 7, Cat 12, Cat 18, Cat 20) in various Pepwave MAX Transit and Balance models affect real-world performance, compatibility, and feature choices such as dual modem support, WAN failover, and carrier activation—especially compared to smartphone modems?

LTE modem category significantly impacts router speed, carrier compatibility, and advanced features in Pepwave devices. Lower category modems, like Cat 4 and Cat 6, offer slower speeds and less frequency aggregation, resulting in lower throughput compared to higher categories (e.g., Cat 18 or Cat 20). For instance, the MAX Transit Mini (Cat 4) is limited to 100Mbps and often performs worse than smartphones with Cat 18 modems due to fewer supported frequencies and lack of advanced modulation. Higher category modems such as Cat 12, Cat 18, or Cat 20 support carrier aggregation and advanced features, resulting in speeds closer to those of modern smartphones and enabling higher performance and stability.

Feature choices are also affected: Dual modem support is available in the Transit Duo (Cat 12), but not with Cat 18 due to hardware constraints, so users needing dual modems must select Cat 12 or consider alternatives like the MBX HD2 for Cat 18 dual support. WAN failover and load balancing are available across models, but real-world speeds will depend on the modem category. Carrier activation and compatibility can be an issue, especially at higher categories (e.g., Cat 18), where certification and IMEI recognition by carriers like Verizon are required, and workarounds (like using an activated SIM from another device) may be necessary. In contrast, the MAX Transit Mini is certified for Verizon, while others may not yet be.

Compared to smartphones, Pepwave devices with lower category modems will often underperform due to fewer supported frequencies and lack of carrier aggregation. Using external antennas and optimizing outbound/load balancing settings can help, but modem capability is a primary limiting factor for both speed and compatibility across carriers.

How can connectivity from multiple Peplink Balance 305 satellite devices to Azure via a Balance 508 gateway be achieved and what routing and firewall considerations must be addressed for successful end-to-end communication through IP Sec VPN tunnels?

To enable connectivity from multiple Balance 305 devices (satellite sites) to Azure through a Balance 508 gateway over IP Sec VPN tunnels, static routes for the Azure subnet must be added on each Balance 305, using the Balance 508 as the gateway. Similarly, Azure must have a static route for the Balance 305 subnets, also pointing to the Balance 508. Outbound policy rules on the Balance 508 should be configured to allow traffic from the Balance 305 devices to traverse to Azure. Because IP Sec tunnels do not automatically advertise their routes through second hops, these static routes are necessary. Firewalls on both the satellite sites and Azure must be reviewed and configured to permit the required traffic. Additionally, ensuring the Balance 508 properly advertises its routes to the 305 devices and considering subnetting constraints (e.g., static routes may need to point to gateways within the same subnet) is important for seamless routing.

How can you configure the Peplink Balance 20/30 series to ensure that FTP traffic from a specific server always uses a designated WAN connection, and what steps must be followed in the web interface to implement this setup?

To ensure that FTP traffic from a specific server always uses a designated WAN connection on the Peplink Balance 20/30 series, you must use the outbound policy feature. First, go to the Network settings and set the Outbound Policy to 'Managed by Custom Rules'. Retain the default rules 'HTTPS Persistence' and 'Default'. Then, add a new custom rule that matches traffic from the server (by its IP address) and specifies the FTP protocol, setting it to route through the desired WAN connection. This will ensure that FTP traffic from the server is consistently sent out on the specified WAN and that return traffic uses the same path, preserving session integrity. After creating the rule, click 'Save' and then 'Apply Changes' to activate the configuration. This prevents round-robin switching for the FTP session and ensures session stability.

For a Peplink MAX Transit device that is out of warranty, what are the available options for maintaining InControl 2 (IC2) access, and how do Extended Warranty, InControl 2 Subscription, and SmartCare/TotalCare differ in coverage, eligibility, and applicability to this device?

For a Peplink MAX Transit device that is out of warranty, you can maintain IC2 access by purchasing an InControl 2 Subscription (typically available for 12 or 24 months), as this option is available for MAX Transit and similar models. Alternatively, you could purchase an Extended Warranty, which includes both hardware coverage and IC2 access for one or two years. SmartCare or TotalCare are premium options primarily for enterprise-grade models, and may not be applicable to all models like MAX Transit. The IC2 Subscription is more affordable, provides only IC2 access, and does not restore hardware warranty. Extended Warranty restores both hardware coverage and IC2 access. SmartCare/TotalCare, where available, offer full coverage including hardware warranty, IC2 access, telephone support, and advance replacement, but SmartCare/TotalCare is generally reserved for higher-end or enterprise models, not necessarily MAX Transit. For renewal, you may need to provide serial numbers to Peplink or a partner. If you only need IC2 manageability and not hardware coverage, the IC2 Subscription is the most cost-effective choice for the MAX Transit.

How does Peplink's SpeedFusion technology enable reliable connectivity and what are the required device and licensing configurations for using features like hot failover and bonding on the Pepwave Max BR1 Mini?

Peplink's SpeedFusion technology provides reliable connectivity by combining (bonding) multiple internet connections at the packet level, which increases bandwidth and helps maintain uninterrupted service, even during WAN failures. SpeedFusion also supports hot failover, which seamlessly switches traffic between WAN links without dropping sessions, ideal for applications like VoIP and video calls. To use SpeedFusion features such as hot failover and bonding, the Pepwave Max BR1 Mini must be licensed accordingly: users need to activate a failover license to unlock these features. Additionally, a SpeedFusion tunnel requires at least two endpoints, with at least one having a public (or DDNS-registered) IP address. The BR1 Mini supports dual-band Wi-Fi and can use its WAN port for additional connections, but the WAN port and Wi-Fi WAN functionality must be unlocked via a paid license. PrimeCare membership is included for one year, granting access to InControl2 cloud management and software updates, but SpeedFusion features can be permanently unlocked with the additional license, independent of PrimeCare renewal.

How can you achieve bonded bandwidth using multiple WAN connections on Peplink Balance devices, and what are the key hardware, software, and configuration requirements and limitations, including model support, licensing, and expected performance impacts for single-user and multi-user scenarios?

To achieve bonded bandwidth using multiple WAN connections on Peplink Balance devices, you must use SpeedFusion technology, which requires at least two SpeedFusion-capable Peplink devices (hardware or FusionHub virtual appliance) at each endpoint. Not all models support SpeedFusion: Balance 210, 310, 305, 380, 580, 710, and above do, while Balance 30 and Balance 50 do not (and cannot be upgraded). Balance One and Balance 305 require a software license for SpeedFusion. For the Balance 30 Pro, a license add-on is also required. SpeedFusion aggregates multiple WANs to provide a single high-speed, session-persistent VPN connection, but the actual combined bandwidth for a single stream may be less than the sum of the WANs due to overhead. For multi-user environments, load balancing alone can optimize bandwidth by steering multiple sessions over different WANs, but only SpeedFusion can bond bandwidth for single-user sessions. The setup requires configuring a PepVPN/SpeedFusion tunnel between compatible devices, with all WANs set to priority 1 for proper bonding. Both endpoints must have sufficient bandwidth to realize the benefits. SpeedFusion uses TCP 32015 and UDP 4500 by default. Performance may be reduced by encryption overhead, and the practical maximum throughput depends on the model. For large LANs or high traffic, higher-end models are recommended. SpeedFusion can also be deployed using FusionHub on virtual platforms for flexible endpoint options.

When upgrading from a Peplink Balance 20 to a Balance 20X for a home network with 1Gbps fiber and multiple users/devices, what are the key considerations regarding throughput, WAN port configuration, VLAN/SSID support, and feature limitations such as SpeedFusion, USB WAN, and IPv6?

Upgrading from a Balance 20 to a Balance 20X for a home network with 1Gbps fiber and multiple users/devices offers a significant throughput improvement: the Balance 20 is limited to 100–150Mbps while the Balance 20X can reach about 900Mbps, though it may not hit the full 1Gbps, especially with IPv6 enabled. The 20X supports only one WAN port (plus cellular/USB), so if multiple wired WAN ports are required, a Balance One or Two may be preferable. The 20X supports up to 7 SSIDs and 4 VLANs, with Bonjour forwarding, making it suitable for segmenting home networks. For VPN bonding, SpeedFusion Cloud is capped at 100Mbps, and SpeedFusion VPN throughput is about 60Mbps with encryption. The USB WAN port should not be relied on for primary connectivity as it is limited (about 150Mbps). IPv6 may cause performance issues or crashes at high speeds on the 20X. PrimeCare is optional for basic functionality, but provides extended warranty and management features. For users needing true 1Gbps throughput and better multi-WAN support, the Balance Two is recommended.

How do the Peplink BR1 Pro 5G and Max BR2 Pro 5G routers differ in terms of modem chipset, cellular connectivity, WAN/LAN port configurations, and suitability for future AT&T 5G networks?

The Peplink BR1 Pro 5G and Max BR2 Pro 5G differ in several key areas. The BR1 Pro 5G uses a single Qualcomm X62 modem, supporting three-way 5G carrier aggregation and AT&T's Andromeda Spectrum, making it more suitable for future AT&T mid-band 5G networks. In contrast, the Max BR2 Pro 5G features dual Qualcomm X62 modems (in its latest version), enabling dual active cellular connections and improved redundancy. Previous Max BR2 Pro units used X55 modems, which do not support AT&T's upcoming mid-band 5G spectrum, limiting their long-term compatibility. The BR1 Pro 5G provides three Ethernet ports (one 2.5 Gbps WAN and two 1 Gbps LAN), while the BR2 Pro 5G offers multiple WAN (two 2.5 Gbps) and LAN (up to four) ports, as well as USB tethering and dual Wi-Fi 6 radios. The BR2 Pro 5G is more suitable for users needing high redundancy, multiple WAN options, and advanced mobile deployments, while the BR1 Pro 5G is a cost-effective, future-proof single modem solution for users focused on AT&T network compatibility and simplicity.

How can a network technician enable Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) Reports on a supported Balance, MAX, or MediaFast router, what are the prerequisites, and what details do the reports provide once enabled?

To enable Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) Reports on a supported Balance, MAX, or MediaFast router, a technician must first ensure the device is running firmware version 7.0.1 or later and that the device is managed through InControl 2. DPI is always available by default on supported devices and can be turned on from the device dashboard within InControl 2, without the need for additional configuration. Once DPI is enabled, the technician can access DPI Reports through the Reports menu in InControl 2. These reports provide a breakdown of traffic types by inspecting the data part of packets, categorizing them by application protocol, showing the percentage of bandwidth each type occupies, and indicating times of usage.

How should a technician resolve compatibility and connection issues when using a Verizon Novatel U620L modem or Netgear 771S modem (Zing/Sprint) with the Pepwave Surf SOHO or Balance 380 routers, and what role do firmware versions and APN settings play in these solutions?

To address compatibility and connection issues with the Verizon Novatel U620L on the Surf SOHO, the technician should install the custom firmware version 6.2.1s064, which has been provided by Peplink specifically to enable support for this modem. If the modem is not recognized after this update, Peplink can sometimes offer special firmware on request for unsupported devices. For the Balance 380 router, a special firmware (6.2.3s013-build3399) is recommended if using the Verizon 6620L, and the U620L is supported by a separate special firmware download. For the Netgear 771S (Zing/Sprint), users of the Surf SOHO MK3 should upgrade to the latest beta firmware or a newer firmware update, as these have resolved previous connectivity issues. Persistent problems with the 771S may be due to modem manufacturer updates, and waiting for future firmware or opening a support ticket may be necessary. Additionally, for the Novatel 620L, the correct APN must be entered manually for the modem to function, whereas the Pantech 290 automatically configures its APN. Changing APN settings was attempted as a fix for the 771S, but did not resolve the issue, further highlighting the importance of correct firmware.

How can you ensure syslog traffic reliably reaches a central syslog server when using SpeedFusion links with Layer3 Isolation enabled on a Pepwave device, and what routing or outbound policy adjustments may be necessary?

When using SpeedFusion with Layer3 Isolation enabled, syslog traffic between clients on the SpeedFusion link may be blocked, resulting in erratic syslog reporting. One approach is to implement a route that explicitly allows syslog traffic (Port 514) between clients on the SpeedFusion link. Alternatively, you can attempt to force syslog traffic to exit locally from each device by setting outbound rules with priority for WAN connections specifically for Port 514. However, it is not guaranteed that such outbound rules will affect syslog traffic generated by the device itself, as attempts to set such policies for source/destination IP and Port 514 for both UDP and TCP have not always led to successful syslog reporting, even after disabling Layer3 Isolation. Therefore, careful adjustment of routes and outbound policies is needed, but Layer3 Isolation may still prevent syslog traffic from being delivered unless specifically permitted.

How do untagged and tagged VLAN configurations on Peplink Balance and connected switches affect device connectivity and network setup, and what issues can arise if ports are set to access versus trunk modes?

Untagged VLANs represent the default LAN and cannot be assigned a VLAN tag on Peplink Balance devices; only tagged networks are considered part of a VLAN. When connecting a Peplink Balance to a switch, both untagged and tagged VLANs should be permitted between the devices because some protocols require untagged traffic. Limiting which VLANs are allowed should be managed through the switch, not just on the Peplink. When configuring ports, if Port1 is set to access the default untagged VLAN and Port2 is set as a trunk for a tagged VLAN, devices on Port1 may lose access to the default VLAN if Port2 is in trunk mode—a potential bug that may require support intervention. In general, both ports set to access mode allow for proper connectivity on the untagged VLAN. For static IP reservations and DHCP, ensure that the DHCP server is configured for the untagged LAN on Port1 and tagged VLANs on Port2 to prevent conflicts. VLAN and port mode misconfiguration can lead to device isolation or connectivity issues, especially in environments with both tagged and untagged traffic.

How does IPv6 addressing and routing in a dual-stack network with a Pepwave Balance One differ from traditional IPv4, and what protocols and address types are involved in local and global communication?

IPv6 addressing in a dual-stack environment, such as with a Pepwave Balance One, differs from IPv4 in several key aspects. IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses written in hexadecimal, while IPv4 uses 32-bit decimal addresses. The Pepwave Balance One provides both a link-local (fe70::256:caff:fe60:a391) and a global IPv6 address (2601:647:ce00:3cf9::bd06). Link-local addresses, starting with 'fe80', are automatically generated (often using EUI-64 and the device's MAC address) and are only accessible on the local network segment. Global addresses are routable across the LAN and the internet. Unlike IPv4, which relies on ARP for address resolution and often uses NAT due to address scarcity, IPv6 replaces ARP with the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) and does not require NAT for most deployments, as all devices can have publicly routable addresses. IPv6 supports both static and dynamic routing; OSPFv3 is used for dynamic routing and supports both IPv4 and IPv6 via address families. Routers must have IPv6 Unicast routing enabled and interfaces assigned to OSPFv3 processes. SLAAC and DHCPv6 are used for address assignment in IPv6, with SLAAC allowing devices to self-configure addresses based on router advertisements, and DHCPv6 providing additional configuration options like DNS. IPv6 eliminates broadcast messaging in favor of multicast and introduces anycast addresses for load balancing. In summary, IPv6 on Pepwave provides local communication via link-local addresses and global communication via global unicast addresses, using protocols like NDP for neighbor discovery, SLAAC for autoconfiguration, and OSPFv3 for dynamic routing, all of which differ significantly from the IPv4 approach.

What is the current and future status of the Peplink Surf SOHO product line, and what features or capabilities are being discussed or anticipated for its replacement?

The Peplink Surf SOHO is currently classified as a legacy product, which means it is no longer in production and will not be restocked once the existing inventory is sold out. This aligns with Peplink's shift in focus away from residential customers, as seen with prior discontinuations of models like the Balance One and Core. There are no plans to produce more Surf SOHO units, and once current inventory is depleted, it will no longer be available. Peplink is currently developing a new replacement product for the SOHO market, but specific details are not yet available. Users have expressed interest in enhancements for the replacement, such as support for 1Gbps symmetric WAN, USB functionality similar to the Surf SOHO, WiFi 6, WiFi as WAN, bufferbloat management via fq_codel or Cake, inclusion of the 5.9GHz band, possibly 2.5Gbps ports (though cost-effectiveness is uncertain), setup wizards for residential security, and detection of insecure configuration settings.

How should a technician configure a Peplink Balance 20 router to optimize bufferbloat mitigation for both uploads and downloads, considering current firmware limitations, throughput constraints, and the interaction of relevant QoS features?

To optimize bufferbloat mitigation on the Peplink Balance 20, a technician should first recognize that the 'Mitigate Bufferbloat' feature, which uses the fq_codel algorithm, currently only addresses upload latency and not download latency, with a fix expected in firmware version 9. To improve upload bufferbloat, enable the 'Mitigate Bufferbloat' option and set the WAN ingress (upload) bandwidth 5-15% below the ISP's advertised upload speed, as this helps fq_codel function effectively and accounts for bandwidth fluctuations, especially on fixed wireless connections. Since download bufferbloat is not yet addressed by this feature, consider enabling the 'DSL cable optimization' QoS setting to prioritize certain traffic types, but be aware that this setting will not function when 'Mitigate Bufferbloat' is enabled. Also, be mindful of the Balance 20's maximum throughput (150 Mbps), as exceeding this with high-speed WAN connections can cause high CPU usage and unresponsiveness during large downloads; in such cases, consider limiting the WAN bandwidth or implementing group bandwidth limits. Adjusting packet buffer sizes may also help further reduce latency, but requires manual tuning. Until download mitigation is available in a future firmware update, these steps can provide the best bufferbloat performance within current hardware and software constraints.

How does modem chipset selection in the Peplink MAX BR1 Pro 5G and BR2 Pro 5G impact compatibility and future-proofing for major US cellular carriers, and what should a technician consider when deploying these routers for AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile networks?

Modem chipset selection is crucial for both current compatibility and future-proofing on major US networks. The BR1 Pro 5G uses either the Qualcomm X55 or X62 modem, while the BR2 Pro 5G uses the newer X62 modem. The X55 modem supports current 5G and 4G bands but will not support AT&T’s future mid-band (Andromeda Spectrum), limiting long-term capability. The X62 modem in both the BR1 (if present) and BR2 Pro 5G supports more bands, including the Andromeda Spectrum, ensuring future-proofing for AT&T. For Verizon, both routers are compatible and have been confirmed to work with pre-paid and post-paid plans. For T-Mobile, both support key bands like band 71 and function with T-Mobile Business Internet, but BYOD is not permitted on T-Mobile Home Internet. Additionally, both models offer advanced features like multi-band carrier aggregation, Wi-Fi 6, and MIMO for better performance. When deploying, the technician should verify the modem version (preferably X62 for future-proofing), confirm carrier certification (especially with Verizon and AT&T FirstNet), and be aware of T-Mobile’s BYOD restrictions depending on the service type.

How do the Qualcomm X55 and X62 modem chipsets compare regarding carrier aggregation, support for AT&T's Andromeda Spectrum, and future-proofing in Peplink BR1 Pro 5G and BR2 Pro 5G routers?

The Qualcomm X55 modem, found in earlier models of both the Peplink BR1 Pro 5G and BR2 Pro 5G routers, supports 5G and Wi-Fi 6, provides robust connectivity, and is compatible with T-Mobile's band 71 and AT&T's band 14. However, it does not support AT&T's Andromeda Spectrum or newer mid-band 5G frequencies, which limits its future-proofing as AT&T advances its 5G network. The X62 modem, present in the updated BR1 Pro 5G and BR2 Pro 5G, supports three-way and multi-band carrier aggregation, enabling the combination of low and mid-band frequencies for better speed and reliability. Most importantly, the X62 supports AT&T's Andromeda Spectrum, making it more future-proof for upcoming 5G deployments. The X62 also supports a broader range of international bands and 5G Phase 2, ensuring better longevity and compatibility. Therefore, when comparing these modems in Peplink's routers, the X62-equipped versions are preferable for users seeking enhanced carrier aggregation, full AT&T 5G compatibility, and greater future-proofing.

What is the required configuration and firmware for reliably managing a Starlink dish via a Peplink router, and what troubleshooting steps and limitations should a technician be aware of when access to the Starlink dish's management interface at 192.168.100.1 is not working as expected?

To reliably manage a Starlink dish via a Peplink router, the router must be running special firmware version 8.1.1s118 and be configured with the WAN connection method set to DHCP/NAT mode and automatic DNS. The management IP address for the Peplink router should be set within the range 192.168.100.2 to 192.168.100.254, which enables access to the Starlink dish's management interface at 192.168.100.1. After applying these settings, LAN clients should be able to reach the management app.

If access does not work as expected, first confirm that firmware 8.1.1s118 is installed and the above network settings are correct. Next, create an outbound policy with the source set to "Any", destination set to 192.168.100.1, and use the Enforced algorithm directed to the Starlink WAN. Be aware that some Peplink models (such as Balance One) do not support this feature, and that the Starlink dish may only respond to pings at boot-up, limiting interface availability. Also, static routes cannot be set on WAN interfaces on many Peplink devices, and outbound policies may fail if the Starlink dish only responds to requests with its own MAC address.

For reliable firmware updates, use a Windows device connected via Ethernet rather than Wi-Fi or Mac. If web browser issues are encountered, try using Microsoft Edge instead of Chrome or Brave. In persistent cases, consider alternative out-of-band management setups or using a secondary router or WAN port with a switch for direct access to the Starlink dish.

How do firmware versions and module firmware updates affect connectivity and log features across different Pepwave devices, and what troubleshooting steps should be taken when encountering SIM or network issues?

Firmware versions and cellular module firmware updates are critical for resolving connectivity issues, supporting new hardware, and enabling certain logging and integration features across Pepwave devices. When encountering SIM or network issues, technicians should first check for and apply the latest firmware updates for both the device and cellular module firmware, as many connectivity and compatibility problems have been resolved this way. For instance, updated firmware can resolve Bandwidth log failures and SIM connectivity issues, especially with specific carriers like T-Mobile and KPN. Additionally, verifying IMEI status with the carrier, ensuring the device supports the network technology (e.g., 5G), and checking APN settings are important steps. If issues persist, further troubleshooting such as factory resets or opening a support ticket may be necessary. Upgrading to specific firmware versions can also enable features like SSL certificate auto-updates, Starlink integration, and address known bugs.

How does Peplink's High Availability (HA) implementation using VRRP work for LAN and WAN failover in a 1+1 Backup configuration, and what are the critical configuration requirements and limitations when using models like Balance 210 and 20X?

Peplink's High Availability (HA) uses a master/slave (active-standby) architecture based on the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). In a 1+1 Backup configuration, the master router handles all traffic and sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets on the LAN to a multicast address. The slave router monitors these packets and, if they stop (indicating master failure), the slave takes over within 10–15 seconds. For LAN failover, a Virtual IP (VIP) is configured on the same subnet as both routers, serving as the default gateway for LAN hosts. For WAN failover, in NAT mode, VRRP enables the slave to assume the master’s WAN IP address, requiring only one public IP address for the HA pair. Both routers must share the same HA group identifier and be on the same subnet. Configuration Sync can automate the settings transfer from master to slave, or manual configuration can be used. For best reliability, separate Ethernet switches are recommended to avoid single points of failure. On models like Balance 20X, limitations include only being master/backup for one network and potential issues with cable modems due to use of an inappropriate virtual MAC address, which can cause WAN connectivity problems with some ISPs. The VRRP virtual MAC address used may not conform to expectations, leading to the WAN port showing a private IP instead of the public IP, and packet captures may yield LAN rather than WAN traffic during failover events.

When configuring a site-to-site IPSec VPN between a Peplink device (such as Peplink-310 or Pepwave MAX) and a Cisco ASA router—especially when the Cisco ASA has a private IP on its WAN interface and is behind double NAT, and the Peplink is using a PPPoE dialer with a fixed IP, what are the key mode selection considerations and potential configuration steps required for successful tunnel establishment?

When the Cisco ASA is behind double NAT and has a private IP on its WAN interface, while the Peplink device uses a PPPoE dialer with a fixed IP, you should use Aggressive mode for the IPSec VPN on both devices. Main mode requires both peers to have static, public IP addresses, and will fail with errors like 'Malformed payload' if used in this configuration. When using Aggressive mode, you must configure explicit local and remote peer IDs on both sides, typically in the format 'DeviceA@DeviceB'. Also, ensure that the peer ID on the branch Peplink points to the HQ Peplink's WAN IP, not the private IP of the Cisco ASA. If configuration issues persist due to NAT or addressing, you may need to alter the Cisco ASA's network configuration, such as having it use the Peplink as its WAN gateway and assign its private LAN IP as its WAN IP, or consider obtaining a public WAN IP. Alternatively, SpeedFusion VPN can provide greater resilience and simpler handling of double NAT scenarios.

How should you configure public IP addressing and VRRP groups for WAN and LAN interfaces in a high availability NAT-mode setup with two ISPs using Peplink Balance routers, and what are the trade-offs between the available options?

In a high availability (HA) NAT-mode setup with Peplink Balance routers and two ISPs, you must configure VRRP with a virtual IP (VIP) for the LAN, which will serve as the default gateway for LAN devices. For the WAN side, there are two main options: 

Option 1 is to use three VRRP groups—one for the LAN and one for each ISP WAN connection. This requires a total of six public IP addresses (three per ISP, for master, slave, and VIP per WAN). This approach provides redundancy for both LAN and WAN interfaces but needs more public IPs.

Option 2 is to use a simpler setup with only two public IP addresses. Here, the master router handles both WAN connections and the slave only takes over the WAN IP address when failover occurs. This means only one public IP per ISP is needed, as the slave router assumes the master’s WAN IP upon failover. This option saves public IP addresses but may provide less granular redundancy.

In both options, VRRP enables seamless failover between routers, with failover typically occurring in 10-15 seconds. Both routers must be on the same subnet, share the same HA group identifier, and use the same internet connection mode (NAT or Drop-in). Additional Ethernet switches are recommended to eliminate single points of failure.

What are the advantages and management trade-offs of using Layer 2 SpeedFusion VPNs for global multicasting deployments, and what additional considerations should be kept in mind regarding network management, firewalling, and topology?

Layer 2 SpeedFusion VPNs are recommended for global solutions that require multicast traffic because they allow Peplink devices to act as Layer 2 switches, supporting multicast across locations. Layer 2 and Layer 3 SpeedFusion both offer the same level of reliability, but Layer 2 is specifically required for multicast. However, Layer 2 VPNs have notable management and control limitations compared to Layer 3 VPNs. For example, firewall rules cannot restrict traffic between networks when those networks are bridged via Layer 2 VPN—meaning traffic flows cannot be limited using Peplink's configuration in this scenario. Layer 3 VPNs provide better management and control features. For network design, a star topology with a Balance 710 at the center, connecting to multiple Balance 380s and their respective BR1 devices, is recommended for Layer 2 SpeedFusion deployments. High availability at headquarters can be achieved by adding another Peplink device. When implementing a full mesh network, be mindful of latency and packet loss between the core router (such as the Balance 710) and branch routers (BR1s).

How do the Peplink Balance 20’s throughput limitations affect its suitability for networks with multiple WAN connections and 20–30 users engaged in bandwidth-intensive activities such as Zoom, and what upgrade options are recommended?

The Peplink Balance 20 has a throughput limit of 100–150 Mbps, depending on hardware revision and firmware. In real-world conditions, actual throughput may be significantly lower, especially if the device is handling large downloads or high concurrent traffic, leading to high CPU usage and unresponsiveness. For networks with 20–30 users and high-bandwidth applications like Zoom, the Balance 20 is undersized and may not deliver adequate performance. Users with multiple WAN connections may find that the combined bandwidth exceeds the Balance 20’s capacity, making it a bottleneck, especially during heavy usage. Recommended upgrades include the Balance 305 (up to 1 Gbps), Balance 210 (up to 350 Mbps with an additional license), or Balance One, all of which offer higher throughput and more advanced features suitable for larger or more demanding environments.

How does the hardware revision of the Peplink Balance 210 affect its SpeedFusion throughput capabilities and what are the implications for bonding multiple WAN connections in a site-to-site VPN setup for a poorly serviced area?

The SpeedFusion throughput of the Peplink Balance 210 depends significantly on its hardware revision. Hardware revisions 2 and 3 are limited to a maximum SpeedFusion throughput of 30Mbps, with an overall router throughput of 100Mbps. Hardware revision 4 increases encrypted SpeedFusion throughput to 80Mbps (and up to 150Mbps without encryption), and also allows activation of a third WAN port. Hardware revision 1.0 is even more limited, offering only 30Mbps encrypted VPN throughput and 50Mbps total router throughput. These throughput ceilings mean that even if multiple high-speed WAN links are bonded (for example, three 80Mbps links), the total combined SpeedFusion tunnel speed will not exceed the hardware’s maximum—typically 80Mbps for HW4 or 30Mbps for HW2/HW3. Thus, for a site-to-site VPN in a poorly serviced area, selecting the right Balance 210 hardware revision is crucial to maximize bonded throughput. Using older hardware may significantly underutilize available WAN capacity, and upgrading to a newer or higher model (such as the Balance One or Balance 310) may be necessary to take full advantage of multiple connections.

A site currently uses a Peplink Balance One with five WAN connections and is experiencing throughput limitations and user growth beyond 60 users. What are the recommended upgrade paths to address both current throughput and expected user load, and what additional features or considerations should be accounted for when choosing among these options?

For a site using a Peplink Balance One with five WAN connections and experiencing throughput and user growth limitations, it is recommended to upgrade to a higher model such as the Balance 305, which provides 1Gbps throughput and supports more users. The Balance 305 is suitable for deployments with over 60 users, addressing the Balance One's performance and user limitations (Balance One is recommended for up to 50–60 users and supports up to 400–600Mbps throughput depending on the number of WANs). For even greater throughput or user requirements, consider the Balance 580 (1.5Gbps), Balance 710 (2.5Gbps), Balance 1350 (5Gbps), or Balance 2500 (8Gbps). Higher models also offer advanced features such as hardware high availability, enhanced AP controller functionality, and user group-based QoS, which are not available on the Balance One. It's also important to assess actual bandwidth needs and consider traffic types, WAN link numbers, and SpeedFusion VPN usage when selecting the right model.

A technician is configuring a Peplink Balance 20 for PPTP VPN access. After connecting, users can access the router's admin page but cannot reach other devices on the LAN or browse the internet. What multi-step troubleshooting and configuration changes should be performed to resolve these issues, considering subnet overlap, routing, and firewall rules?

To resolve issues where PPTP VPN users can connect to the router's admin page but cannot access other LAN devices or browse the internet, a technician should perform the following multi-step troubleshooting and configuration process:

1. Verify and adjust firewall rules: Ensure there is an inbound firewall rule that explicitly allows traffic from the VPN source IP range to the LAN destination IP range. The rule should specify 'Any' for WAN and protocol, and should match the source and destination subnets to the LAN addressing. If issues persist, temporarily set both inbound and outbound firewall rules to Allow All to rule out firewall filtering as the cause.

2. Address subnet overlap: If the VPN client and the LAN are on the same subnet, change the VPN client IP address to a different subnet (e.g., to 192.168.2.x if the LAN is 192.168.1.x) to avoid routing conflicts.

3. Review routing configuration: If the remote and local LANs share the same subnet, set up static routes on the client to direct traffic for the LAN through the VPN. This ensures proper routing of packets to LAN devices.

4. Check for additional LAN-side filtering: If connectivity issues persist even after the above steps, verify that there are no other filtering or blocking rules on the LAN itself that could be preventing access from the VPN.

By methodically addressing firewall rules, subnetting, routing, and LAN-side filtering, connectivity for PPTP VPN users to LAN resources and the internet can be restored.

How have past InControl maintenance events and system overloads led to changes in cluster upgrade procedures and offline device handling, and what evidence supports these changes?

Previous InControl maintenance events, such as the one on 24 May 2023, caused system overloads when a maintenance fix was deployed to all InControl “planets” at once. This resulted in devices being incorrectly marked as offline due to the device communication cluster’s inability to process the high volume of re-authentication requests. To address this, changes were made to deploy fixes to only one planet at a time and to add resources to the communication cluster. Additionally, the system was updated to stop marking devices as offline during periods of high authentication volume, preventing false alarms. Previous overloads, such as the January 2, 2024 incident, similarly led to devices being falsely marked offline due to system component overloads, highlighting the need for these procedural changes.

How do hardware revision, firmware version, and model selection impact the maximum attainable throughput on the Peplink Balance 20, and what are the implications for users with high-speed (e.g., gigabit) internet connections?

The maximum attainable throughput of the Peplink Balance 20 depends on both hardware revision and firmware version. Older hardware revisions may be limited to 20Mbps or 100Mbps, while newer revisions (e.g., the R6 hardware) can reach up to 150Mbps, especially when running the latest firmware. Firmware updates (such as version 6.1) can optimize performance and enable features like PepVPN, but do not increase the hardware-imposed throughput ceiling. Regardless of WAN port speeds or the number of WAN connections, the total throughput cannot exceed the device's hardware maximum. For users with high-speed or gigabit internet connections, the Balance 20 will bottleneck bandwidth, resulting in significant speed loss (sometimes over 40%) compared to direct modem connections. Users requiring higher throughput must upgrade to a more capable model, such as the Balance One (600Mbps) or Balance 305, since the Balance 20 cannot be upgraded to support gigabit speeds and lacks advanced features like SpeedFusion. Additionally, the Balance 20 does not support user/group bandwidth controls, further limiting its suitability for large or demanding networks.

How can a Pepwave Balance 20X be configured to bond two VDSL2 lines for both TCP and UDP traffic, and what are the considerations for WAN port expansion and IPv6 support in this scenario?

To bond two VDSL2 lines on a Pepwave Balance 20X, you can use a USB Ethernet adapter as a second WAN port (WAN2) in addition to the built-in Ethernet WAN. Once both WAN ports are connected to VDSL2 lines, SpeedFusion bonding can be configured to aggregate the lines. For TCP traffic, set up a SpeedFusion profile that enables per-packet bonding to maximize throughput and reliability. For UDP traffic, configure the profile to prefer the WAN with the lowest round-trip time (RTT) while still using the tunnel to maintain a consistent source IP. For IPv6 connectivity, you can establish a 6in4 tunnel (e.g., via HE.net) and forward protocol 41 through SpeedFusion to the appropriate device behind the firewall. Note that while using a USB Ethernet adapter is common in practice, there is no explicit official confirmation of support or compatibility for all adapters, so results may vary. Additionally, all SpeedFusion features (such as bonding) require the appropriate license (PrimeCare).

What are the key considerations and steps for using a Pepwave MAX BR1 Pro 5G with T-Mobile, and how do device features and T-Mobile's policies affect compatibility and performance?

To use a Pepwave MAX BR1 Pro 5G with T-Mobile, it’s crucial to distinguish between T-Mobile Home Internet (TMHI) and T-Mobile Business Internet (TMBI), as their device compatibility policies differ. For TMHI, the SIM card from the Arcadyan KVD21 is usually locked to that device’s IMEI, so it may not work in the BR1 Pro 5G. BYOD (bring your own device) is not supported by TMHI, and attempts to transfer the SIM are unlikely to succeed unless T-Mobile support can associate the new IMEI, which is not officially permitted. However, TMBI allows BYOD: you must contact a T-Mobile business specialist, provide the BR1 Pro 5G’s IMEI and your Employer ID, and receive a new SIM. 

Device features impacting performance include support for all major cellular bands (including band 71), 5G and LTE backward compatibility, high theoretical throughput (up to 2 Gbps), dual-band Wi-Fi 6 for improved speed and range, MIMO antennas for robust data transmission, and support for external antennas to optimize reception. Prime Care and InControl II offer management, updates, and SpeedFusion (for bonding, failover, and smoothing), improving reliability for demanding applications. For best results, install a recommended external antenna such as the Waveform 4x4 for TMBI setups. 

In summary: TMHI is not compatible with the BR1 Pro 5G due to device/SIM restrictions, but TMBI is, provided you follow the correct process. The BR1 Pro 5G's advanced features, when combined with a business plan and proper antenna setup, enable high performance and reliable connectivity on T-Mobile’s network.

How can Peplink Balance devices maintain Wi-Fi Calling functionality when Content Filtering is enabled and IPSec traffic is being blocked, and what are the challenges or limitations with exempting Wi-Fi Calling domains?

Peplink Balance routers can block IPSec traffic through Content Filtering, which may disrupt Wi-Fi Calling since Wi-Fi Calling depends on the IPSec protocol. The standard "Exempted Domain" feature in Web Blocking does not bypass IPSec application blocking, so simply adding Wi-Fi Calling domains to this exemption does not restore the service. A new feature, "Exempted Domains from Application Blocking," is required to maintain Wi-Fi Calling while blocking IPSec tunnels. However, this feature has shown issues in certain firmware versions (such as 7.1.2GA and 8.0.0RC4), and additional testing with firmware 8.0.1 RC4 is ongoing to resolve the problem. If these methods do not work, users are advised to open a support ticket for direct assistance and further troubleshooting.

After performing a factory reset on a Pepwave Surf SOHO, what are the correct steps to regain access to the web admin interface and Wi-Fi network, including default credential details and troubleshooting if the SSID is not visible?

After a factory reset of the Pepwave Surf SOHO, connect a PC directly to the router using an Ethernet cable. This is necessary because the router may not broadcast a wireless SSID immediately after reset, making Wi-Fi access unavailable. Use a USB to Ethernet adapter if the PC does not have an Ethernet port. Set the PC to use DHCP and confirm it receives an IP address in the 192.168.50.x range (typically .10) with a gateway of 192.168.50.1. Access the web admin interface by entering http://192.168.50.1 in a browser. The default login credentials are 'admin' for both username and password. The default Wi-Fi password, once the SSID is available, is the last 8 digits of the LAN MAC address (found on the sticker on the bottom of the device, entered without colons). If the SSID is still not visible, check for broadcast issues and confirm using the wired connection. The default SSID should be in the format 'Pepwave-last 4 digits of serial number.'

How does the BR1 Mini's use of external antennas (such as the Puma 221 and XPOL) and failover licensing combine with its dual SIM capability and SpeedFusion features to ensure reliable connectivity and optimal throughput for mobile applications, especially for video calls or streaming in RVs?

The BR1 Mini supports external antennas like the Puma 221 (an omnidirectional 5-in-1 antenna providing up to 7 dB gain, supporting cellular, Wi-Fi, and GPS) and the XPOL (a directional antenna that improves signal strength when aimed at a tower), which enhance signal reception and throughput for mobile applications like RVs and boats. The router’s dual SIM slots allow users to manage multiple cellular plans, with automatic failover switching if one connection fails. Activating the failover license enables Wi-Fi WAN for seamless switching between campground Wi-Fi and cellular, and also unlocks features such as WAN smoothing and hot failover via SpeedFusion. SpeedFusion technology allows the BR1 Mini to bond multiple connections for uninterrupted video calls or streaming, utilizing both Wi-Fi and cellular simultaneously and selecting the fastest response or smoothing out latency. These features combine to provide a highly reliable and high-performance connectivity solution for mobile users requiring robust video or data streaming.

If you are exhibiting at a crowded event and need reliable internet for multiple devices, how do the BR1 Mini 5G and B One 5G compare in terms of multi-carrier support, WiFi WAN capability, access point requirements, and feature availability with or without Primecare?

For reliable internet at a crowded event with multiple devices, both the BR1 Mini 5G and B One 5G support multi-carrier connectivity using Peplink eSIMs. The B One 5G is generally recommended over the BR1 Mini 5G for such scenarios because it can utilize WiFi WAN for tethering, providing an extra layer of connectivity if cellular bandwidth is congested—this is especially useful in crowded environments. Both devices use the same cellular module, so their cellular performance is similar; however, the BR1 Mini 5G requires an additional access point for WiFi coverage, while the B One 5G does not. Local configuration and management can be performed on both devices without Primecare, either via web or SSH. However, without Primecare, remote management features such as InControl, SpeedFusion bonding, and InTouch are not available. For optimal reliability, it is advisable to use a device that can maintain two active connections at once, reducing the risk of downtime during carrier switching, which is critical for applications like point-of-sale systems.

Why do users often report that SpeedFusion bonding of two cellular connections on devices like the Pepwave Max Transit Duo results in lower or less predictable download speeds compared to using a single SIM, and what are some effective troubleshooting and optimization strategies?

Users frequently find that SpeedFusion bonding of two cellular connections on devices like the Pepwave Max Transit Duo yields lower or less predictable download speeds compared to a single SIM due to several factors. Firstly, cellular connections are subject to bandwidth sharing at the tower, which can limit the actual combined throughput, especially when using two SIMs from the same provider. Bonding also introduces protocol overhead and packet sequencing challenges, which can further reduce effective speed. Differences in latency or quality between the two links can cause packet reordering and inefficiency in the bond. Additionally, the maximum bandwidth to the FusionHub endpoint and the connection quality between the Pepwave device and FusionHub (such as latency or packet loss) play a significant role. Users have tried adjusting settings like MTU and WAN Connection Buffer Size, but these rarely yield substantial improvements. Recommended troubleshooting steps include testing each SIM individually to assess their standalone performance and using WAN Analysis to ensure both are configured for similar bands and performance. Using SIMs from different providers and upgrading antennas can help, as can temporarily pausing one connection based on latency thresholds to improve bond quality. Outbound traffic rules and hosting the FusionHub in a high-capacity data center may further optimize results.

How can DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection) channel limitations affect a Pepwave device’s ability to connect to or broadcast on 5GHz Wi-Fi, and what troubleshooting steps can be taken to resolve 5GHz connectivity issues?

DFS channel limitations can prevent a Pepwave device from connecting to or broadcasting on certain 5GHz Wi-Fi channels because Peplink devices do not support DFS channels. When a 5GHz Wi-Fi network or access point operates on a DFS-required channel, the Pepwave device will be unable to connect or broadcast on that frequency. This can result in the device remaining in a scanning state despite strong signal strength and correct credentials. To resolve this, ensure the 5GHz Wi-Fi network is configured to use a non-DFS channel, such as channel 36, 48, or 149, which has been shown to restore connectivity. It is also recommended to check the 'Broadcast SSID' setting and ensure it is enabled, as disabling this can prevent devices from connecting. Additionally, firmware updates may affect Wi-Fi broadcasting capabilities, so reverting to a known good firmware version or toggling relevant settings can help. Finally, avoid using 5GHz for both Wi-Fi WAN and AP simultaneously, as this can also cause connectivity issues.

How can you maintain access to a modem behind a WAN port on a Peplink Balance 30 Pro LTEA when its health check fails, while still keeping health checks enabled for outbound policy? What configuration change is required, and how does this differ from the default behavior?

By default, when a WAN link's health check fails on a Peplink Balance 30 Pro LTEA, the modem behind that WAN becomes inaccessible from the LAN if other WANs are online. To maintain access to the modem regardless of health check status (while keeping health checks for outbound policy), you must create an 'enforced' outbound policy rule that targets the modem's IP address and forces traffic through the specific WAN. This configuration ensures LAN clients can reach the modem even if its health check fails, overcoming the default limitation where access is blocked unless other WANs are disabled.

How can a technician configure a Peplink Balance 20 with two hotspots (AT&T and Verizon) for maximum upload speed, and what advanced options are available for true connection bonding? Include requirements for LAN integration and monitoring.

To configure a Peplink Balance 20 with two hotspots (AT&T and Verizon) for maximum upload speeds, connect each hotspot to a WAN port and set both WANs to 'Always-on (Priority 1)' in the WAN settings. Enable Load Balancing & Failover mode and set the Outbound Policy to 'Auto'. This setup allows the device to distribute upload sessions across both hotspots, maximizing throughput. You can monitor each WAN's status in the Status -> Active Sessions section. For advanced bonding (which combines bandwidth from both connections at the packet level), upgrade to a Balance 20X and use SpeedFusion technology in conjunction with FusionHub Solo or a SpeedFusion partner tunnel. In all cases, ensure that the LAN devices connect to the Balance 20's LAN port, and configure DHCP on the Balance 20 to assign LAN IP addresses. If integrating with a firewall, set the firewall (e.g., Sonicwall) to Transparent or Bridge mode to maintain seamless connectivity for LAN clients.

How does Peplink SpeedFusion technology provide increased bandwidth, reliability, and seamless failover when bonding multiple internet connections, and what are the key configuration considerations and limitations compared to traditional IPsec VPNs?

Peplink SpeedFusion technology bonds multiple internet connections (such as DSL, cable, 4G/5G, and satellite) to increase bandwidth, reliability, and provide seamless failover. Unlike traditional IPsec VPNs—which can only use a single WAN, are slower to recover from WAN failures, and may require identical circuits—SpeedFusion can aggregate bandwidth from diverse providers, ensuring sessions persist even if one WAN fails. SpeedFusion achieves this by establishing concurrent encrypted VPN tunnels (AES 256-bit) across all WANs between Peplink devices, distributing traffic to maximize available bandwidth and instantly rerouting traffic over healthy links during outages (Hot Failover). Additional features include WAN Smoothing (packet duplication for reduced jitter and packet loss), Forward Error Correction (for minimizing one-way loss), and various traffic management schemes (Bonding, Lowest Latency, Weighted Round Robin, Overflow). For implementation, both endpoints must be Peplink devices, with at least one having a public IP, and hardware must meet encrypted throughput requirements. However, bonding introduces protocol overhead (reducing effective speeds), and the solution requires compatible Peplink hardware with a SpeedFusion license. Unlike IPsec, SpeedFusion supports deployment behind NAT, can operate with only the hub site on public IP, and is easier to set up. Outbound policies and topology (point-to-point, mesh, star) can be customized for optimal performance.

How can you maintain access to a modem behind a WAN port on a Peplink Balance 30 Pro LTEA when its health check fails, while still preserving outbound health checks and policy enforcement for other traffic?

To maintain access to a modem behind a WAN port on a Peplink Balance 30 Pro LTEA even if its health check fails, you should create an outbound policy rule of the 'enforced' type, targeting the modem's IP address and specifying the relevant WAN connection. This configuration ensures that access to the modem is possible regardless of the WAN's health check status, while outbound health checks and standard policy enforcement for other traffic remain intact. This avoids the impractical workaround of disabling all other WAN ports for modem access.

What are the recommended options and considerations for mounting a Peplink HD Dome on a maritime vessel, particularly regarding thread compatibility, material choice, cable management, and installation challenges?

The preferred mounting solution for the Peplink HD Dome on a maritime vessel is to use a sleeve or adapter with an M35 Female thread on one end (to fit the Dome) and a 1"x14 standard Female thread on the other (to fit a 1"x14 standard male maritime fitting). The recommended material for this adapter is 316 stainless steel for corrosion resistance in marine environments. For cable management, installers can choose between a cable exit opening (sometimes a punch-out in a plastic version) or routing cables through the base of the fitting. Most installations use a threaded mount that passes through into the void below, while a minority use a punch-out for cable exit. Care must be taken during installation to avoid twisting cables, especially when using a two-piece stainless mount. Installers should also ensure the mount provides sufficient stand-off distance from the mast and maintains water tightness using sealant or rubber O-rings.

When a Peplink Balance One router consistently achieves only 260–303Mbps throughput despite a 600Mbps rating and direct modem tests confirming higher ISP speeds, what factors should a technician evaluate, and what steps could restore expected performance?

A technician should evaluate several factors when the Balance One underperforms compared to its 600Mbps rating despite the ISP and other routers (e.g., pfSense, Firewalla Gold Plus) achieving higher speeds. High CPU usage on the Balance One, especially peaking at 99-100% during tests, is a common cause of limited throughput. QoS (Quality of Service) settings and outbound policy rules—especially those involving domain names—can significantly reduce bandwidth, sometimes halving it. Firmware version changes, particularly upgrades, have also been linked to performance drops. VLAN configurations may result in different throughput on each LAN segment. Testing methodology matters: browser choice, running background applications, and the number of connections used in speed tests can affect results. To restore bandwidth, try disabling or removing QoS/Application Priority settings, especially those set to High for specific applications like Remote Desktop. Resetting to factory defaults and selectively re-enabling features can help isolate the issue. Testing with recommended tools (like iperf between two PCs) rather than speedtest.net is advised to confirm true throughput. Finally, firmware updates may address known issues, particularly those related to outbound rules, and if unresolved, contacting support is recommended.

When installing a Peplink MBX Mini or MAX BR2 Pro with 4x4 or 8x8 MIMO antennas on a sailing boat, what are the key considerations for antenna configuration and mounting, and how do these affect performance, especially compared to the HD2 Dome?

For optimal cellular performance on a sailing boat, the Peplink MBX Mini and MAX BR2 Pro require careful antenna configuration and mounting. The MBX Mini needs 8 antenna elements for best results, while the MAX BR2 Pro requires a total of 8 antennas, with 4 per modem/SIM slot. Using two 4x4 MIMO antennas with some separation is recommended for the BR2 Pro, and all antennas should be connected in a MIMO configuration for 5G. Directional antennas should be pointed in the same direction, and cable runs should be kept short to minimize signal loss. Maritime antennas may provide better performance than mobility antennas in marine environments. Compared to the HD2 Dome, which does not support 5G and integrates its antennas, the MBX Mini and BR2 Pro with external high-gain MIMO antennas offer better bandwidth, range, and future-proofing, especially within 2.5NM/5km of shore. Proper mounting solutions—such as stainless steel sleeves with M35 and 1"x14 threads—ensure secure installation and cable management. Load balancing is available out of the box, but features like bonding or seamless failover require SpeedFusion and may incur additional costs.

Considering a scenario where an outdoor event requires a future-proof router with high throughput, support for multiple WANs (including high-speed fiber, Starlink, and cellular failover), and the ability to support 1 Gbps leased lines and potentially more users in the future, how do the Peplink Balance 310 5G, 310X, and 380X compare in terms of throughput, WAN support, SpeedFusion capability, and compatibility with third-party firewalls? What are key configuration considerations for such an environment?

The Peplink Balance 310 5G, 310X, and 380X are all suitable for high-throughput, multi-WAN environments at outdoor events, but they each have distinct advantages. The Balance 310 5G is recommended for outdoor events needing future-proofing, especially with 5G cellular connectivity, and offers higher PepVPN throughput than the Balance 20X or Max Transit Duo. However, it lacks 3G support on its 5G modem. The Balance 310X offers 2.5Gbps total throughput and 600Mbps SpeedFusion capability, making it well-suited for bonding connections and supporting high bandwidth needs. The Balance 380X supports multiple WANs, has a firewall throughput of 3Gbps, and is preferred in scenarios requiring LACP for load balancing and compatibility with third-party firewalls, as well as in setups needing more than two WANs. For optimal use, consider the number of users (the Balance 20X, for example, is limited to about 60 users due to VPN throughput), the bandwidth required (such as 1Gbps leased lines), and features like SpeedFusion for bonding connections (necessary for aggregating WAN speeds for single sessions). When using third-party firewalls, ensure the chosen router's stateful firewall throughput matches or exceeds the maximum line rate. Finally, pay attention to the types of WAN connections supported and future scalability needs, as newer models like the BR1 Pro 5G and Balance 380X offer higher port speeds and throughput.

How do hardware revisions and firmware versions affect the throughput of the Peplink Balance 20, and what steps should a technician take to determine and optimize the actual achievable speed when a user is experiencing slower-than-expected download rates on a high-speed ISP connection?

The throughput of the Peplink Balance 20 is primarily determined by the hardware revision and firmware version. Older hardware revisions may be limited to 20 Mbps or 100 Mbps, while newer revisions support up to 150 Mbps when running the latest firmware. To determine the actual throughput, the technician should first identify the hardware revision of the Balance 20 in use. Next, verify that the device is running the latest firmware, as firmware updates can improve or unlock higher throughput capabilities. Testing should be done by connecting a PC directly to the WAN port of the router, rather than through a switch, to eliminate external bottlenecks. It is also important to use a speed test tool that supports multiple streams to better reflect the device's true load-balanced throughput, since single-socket tests like speedtest.net may underreport speeds. If the user requires speeds higher than what the hardware supports, an upgrade to a higher-tier Peplink model (such as the Balance 305 or Balance One) is necessary, as the Balance 20 cannot deliver gigabit speeds due to its hardware limitations.

A technician wishes to integrate a Peplink Balance router into an existing network using Drop-in Mode, with the goal of maintaining the current firewall and adding WAN redundancy with multiple internet connections. What are the technical limitations and necessary configuration considerations for this deployment, particularly with regard to IP address assignment, WAN port usage, firewall compatibility, and features that may be disabled or require special configuration?

When integrating a Peplink Balance router into an existing network using Drop-in Mode, several key technical limitations and configuration considerations must be addressed:

First, Drop-in Mode allows the router to be transparently inserted between the ISP modem and the firewall without requiring changes to the existing firewall or network configuration. The Peplink forwards traffic between LAN and WAN1 without performing IP address translation, so existing security policies and the firewall's original gateway settings remain effective. 

Only a single WAN port (typically WAN1) can be used in Drop-in Mode; additional WAN ports cannot be configured for Drop-in Mode and will operate in NAT mode by default. This is a fundamental limitation—Drop-in Mode supports only one WAN connection for transparent bridging, though additional WANs can be used for failover or load balancing in NAT mode.

If there are no spare IP addresses available on the WAN subnet, the Peplink can share an IP address with the firewall using the Shared IP option, which is available for /30 subnets and requires current firmware. The configuration should be performed via the web admin interface, where LAN and WAN settings are established, Drop-in Mode is enabled, and health checks are configured. After changes, routers and firewalls should be rebooted to update ARP tables.

Certain features are automatically disabled in Drop-in Mode: the PPTP server and High Availability (if the LAN Bypass port is used as WAN). If using a LAN Bypass port for WAN, High Availability is not possible. The firewall should remain on the inside of the Peplink for proper operation, and public IP addresses can remain on the firewall’s outside interface.

For advanced scenarios, such as supporting VPN tunnels configured on the firewall, static NAT for the firewall's private IP may be required. If using multiple inbound services, retaining the current firewall configuration is recommended to facilitate Peplink installation.

In summary, Drop-in Mode is ideal for integrating Peplink into an existing network with no configuration changes to the firewall, but supports only a single transparent WAN connection, may require shared IP configuration for limited IP ranges, and disables certain features for compatibility and transparency.

How does InControl 2 facilitate scalable, secure, and efficient network management for organizations with multiple Peplink devices, and what best practices and precautions should a technician follow when using its centralized configuration features?

InControl 2 enables scalable and efficient management of multiple Peplink devices by providing a centralized, cloud-based platform for configuration, monitoring, firmware management, reporting, and policy enforcement. Organizations can structure their device management hierarchically (organization, group, device), push consistent VLAN, firewall, and outbound policy settings, and manage Wi-Fi and SSIDs across all sites, ensuring compliance and simplifying administration. Bulk configuration and template features allow technicians to deploy settings to many devices simultaneously, while centralized firmware and policy management streamline updates and security practices. InControl 2 also supports real-time diagnostics, device status dashboards, notifications, and geofencing, further enhancing operational oversight.

For secure management, it is recommended that technicians set up user accounts, register devices to claim ownership, and enable two-factor authentication. After securing ownership, InControl 2 management should be disabled on the device itself if remote cloud management is not required, reducing the attack surface. Technicians should be aware that enabling centralized management features (such as Wi-Fi or VLAN management) will overwrite local device settings with group or organization-level profiles, so changes should be carefully coordinated and tested, especially in large or sensitive deployments. Centralized content filtering, firewall, and outbound policy rules should be tailored to organizational needs and compliance requirements, leveraging tagging and group policies for flexible deployment. Firmware updates and configuration changes should be staged and validated before broad rollout, using rollback features if needed. Maintaining an active warranty or license ensures continued access to InControl 2’s full capabilities. Finally, technicians should monitor device and event logs, utilize reporting features for troubleshooting and optimization, and manage user access with appropriate roles and idle timeouts for security and compliance.

How should a technician configure outbound policy on a Peplink Balance 20/30 series router to ensure that specific LAN clients or types of traffic (such as FTP) are routed only through designated WAN connections, preventing round-robin distribution, and what steps must be taken to implement these rules?

To configure outbound policy on a Peplink Balance 20/30 series router so that specific LAN clients or types of traffic (like FTP) are routed exclusively through designated WAN connections, the technician should first navigate to the Network settings and set the Outbound Policy to 'Managed by Custom Rules.' The default rules 'HTTPS Persistence' and 'Default' should be retained. Then, the technician should add new custom rules that specify which LAN clients or which traffic types (e.g., all FTP traffic) should use particular WAN connections. This ensures the targeted traffic will always use the specified WAN, maintaining session integrity and preventing round-robin or weighted balancing for those flows. After creating the rules, the technician must click 'Save' and then 'Apply Changes' to activate the configuration. This approach ensures that both inbound and outbound traffic for sessions like FTP consistently traverse the intended WAN link.

If a technician is experiencing connectivity issues between a Pepwave Surf On-the-Go (SOTG) and a Verizon USB730L modem, what troubleshooting steps related to firmware and modem support packages should be taken, and why are these steps necessary?

The technician should first verify the currently installed firmware version and modem support package on the SOTG. The Verizon USB730L modem requires modem support package 1022 to function correctly. If the SOTG firmware includes an older modem support package (such as 1019), the modem will not work. The modem support package is embedded in the device firmware, so upgrading to the most recent firmware is necessary to obtain the required support package. The technician should download and install the latest available firmware for the SOTG from the official source, ensuring it contains modem support package 1022. After upgrading, compatibility with the USB730L should be achieved. If issues persist after installing the correct firmware, the technician should contact Peplink support for further assistance. These steps are necessary because the modem support package determines compatibility with specific USB modems, and without the correct package, the modem will not function with the SOTG.

How can you configure a Peplink Balance 20/30 series router to ensure FTP traffic from a specific server always uses a single designated WAN connection, and what outbound policy settings must be adjusted to prevent round-robin switching?

To ensure that FTP traffic from a specific server always uses a single designated WAN connection on a Peplink Balance 20/30 series router, you must use the outbound policy feature. Navigate to the Network settings and set the Outbound Policy to 'Managed by Custom Rules'. Retain the default rules ('HTTPS Persistence' and 'Default'), then add a new outbound policy rule specifically for the FTP server or FTP traffic. This rule should direct traffic from the server to the designated WAN connection. This configuration overrides the default 'Auto' policy, which uses a weighted balance algorithm and could result in round-robin distribution of traffic. By specifying a custom rule for FTP traffic, you ensure session persistence and consistent routing through the desired WAN. Remember to save and apply changes after creating these rules.

How should a technician configure a Peplink Balance 30 Pro to maximize both bandwidth for general use and optimize online gaming performance, using both Ethernet WAN and cellular connections, and what are the licensing and setup considerations?

To maximize bandwidth for general use and optimize online gaming on a Peplink Balance 30 Pro with both Ethernet WAN and cellular connections, the technician should first ensure that the SpeedFusion Bonding License (SKU: BPL-031-PRO-LC-SF) is installed, as this is required for bandwidth bonding on the Balance 30 Pro. Next, set up multiple SpeedFusion/PepVPN tunnels between the same two sites, each with distinct profiles: one tunnel configured for WAN Smoothing (for online gaming to reduce latency and packet loss), and another configured for Bonding (for general traffic such as downloading and streaming to aggregate bandwidth). Outbound policies must be configured to route gaming traffic through the WAN Smoothing tunnel and all other traffic through the Bonding tunnel. When configuring tunnel profiles, all WAN connections (both Ethernet and cellular) should be set to Priority 1 in the Bonding profile to enable aggregation. The actual throughput will be limited by the Balance 30 Pro’s maximum performance (120 Mbps without AES-256 encryption, 55 Mbps with AES-256 encryption), the quality of the WAN and cellular links, and the overhead incurred by SpeedFusion headers. Using SpeedFusion Cloud can facilitate the remote endpoint if needed. Careful tuning is necessary to ensure that less stable connections do not degrade overall performance, and testing tools such as SpeedFusion graphs should be used to monitor and optimize the setup.

How do differences in hardware revision and firmware version affect the maximum throughput of the Peplink Balance 310, and what are the implications for users with high-speed internet connections?

The maximum throughput of the Peplink Balance 310 varies significantly by hardware revision. Hardware revision 1 (HW1) is limited to 50 Mbps and cannot be upgraded beyond firmware version 5.x.x; it is also no longer officially supported by Peplink. Hardware revision 2 is also limited to 50 Mbps, especially during large data transfers, and the higher throughput numbers in documentation may reflect theoretical aggregation, not real-world performance. Hardware revision 3 supports up to 200 Mbps. Hardware revision 4 (HW4) increases this to 350 Mbps, and performance may further improve with firmware 6.2.1. Users with internet speeds above 100 Mbps (such as a 200 Mbps fiber connection) will experience performance bottlenecks on older hardware revisions, as the router cannot keep up with the ISP connection. Upgrading to a newer hardware revision or model is strongly recommended for users with high-speed internet. Additionally, users should check for configuration limits and port speed negotiation settings, as these can also restrict throughput.

Given increasing gigabit ISP speeds, what are the practical throughput limitations of the Peplink Balance 20 and 30 series routers, how do these limitations differ across hardware revisions, and what upgrade paths are recommended for users needing higher throughput?

The Peplink Balance 20 and 30 series routers have hardware throughput limitations that prevent them from utilizing gigabit ISP speeds. The Balance 20 typically supports up to 100 Mbps on older hardware, with some revisions supporting up to 150 Mbps. The Balance 30 is also limited to 100 Mbps throughput, despite having multiple WAN ports. These throughput limits mean that users with ISP speeds of 600 Mbps or 1 Gbps will experience significant bottlenecking, with actual network speeds reduced to the router's maximum throughput. The Balance 20 and 30 do not support gigabit throughput; support for such speeds begins with the Balance 305 and higher models, which can provide up to 1 Gbps throughput. Therefore, users seeking to take advantage of high-speed or gigabit ISP services are advised to upgrade to the Balance 305 or higher models, as there are no upgrade options available for the Balance 20 or 30 to support higher speeds. The Balance 210 with an additional license can offer up to 350 Mbps, but for true gigabit support, the Balance 305 or higher is required.

How do the hardware and software limitations of the Surf SOHO router affect its throughput in both WAN-to-LAN and LAN-to-LAN scenarios, and what factors can cause users to perceive lower than expected speeds, even when the physical ports support Gigabit Ethernet?

The Surf SOHO router features WAN and LAN ports rated for Gigabit Ethernet (1000Mbps), but its actual routing throughput is limited by hardware and software to 100–120Mbps. This throughput limitation means that, for WAN-to-LAN traffic, users will be capped at roughly 120Mbps regardless of higher-speed Internet connections or the gigabit capability of the Ethernet ports. For LAN-to-LAN transfers, the Surf SOHO can achieve full gigabit speeds since LAN switching operates independently of the router's WAN-to-LAN throughput cap. However, during large file transfers, the router's CPU may become a bottleneck, potentially reaching 100% utilization, which can cause packet loss and connectivity issues even on wired devices. Additionally, factors such as the number of configured rules, use of special features, WiFi performance variables (like band, interference, and device generation), and real-world conditions can further reduce perceived throughput. Users upgrading to high-speed Internet services (e.g., 200Mbps or higher) may find the Surf SOHO unable to deliver the full speed, and multiple speed tests or alternative models (such as Balance 20X or Balance One) are recommended for higher throughput needs.

What are the key considerations, performance impacts, and best practices when using a single 4x4 MIMO dome antenna to serve two modems (such as on a Pepwave Transit Duo Cat 12 or HD4-MBX Cat 18) compared to using separate 2x2 MIMO antennas for each modem, and how do ground plane sharing and antenna spacing affect interference and upload speeds?

Using a single 4x4 MIMO dome antenna for two modems on devices like the Pepwave Transit Duo Cat 12 or HD4-MBX Cat 18 is convenient but typically results in reduced performance compared to using two separate 2x2 MIMO antennas for each modem. Theoretical concerns include increased interference, especially if both modems use SIMs from the same carrier and frequency, which can negatively impact upload speeds. However, successful installations have been achieved by manually setting allowed frequencies per modem to mitigate interference.

Multiple antennas can share the same ground plane (e.g., a large sheet of metal) without issue, but the effectiveness depends on installation specifics and potential obstructions. The different antenna ports on the HD4-MBX Cat 18 are best tuned to different frequencies, so frequency-dedicated antennas may not always provide consistent performance. For optimal MIMO performance, antennas should be spaced as far apart as possible—ideally 1'-2' apart—and positioned at angles (e.g., 45 to 90 degrees apart) to minimize transmit interference and improve upload speeds. Achieving this ideal spacing can be challenging in compact installations, but practical solutions like mounting antennas on different levels within a single dome have been effective. Real-world testing and adjustments are recommended, as installation conditions can significantly affect results.

How do WAN priority settings and WAN bandwidth configuration interact to affect SpeedFusion tunnel stability and throughput, and what best practices should a technician follow to optimize both failover and performance in a multi-WAN Pepwave deployment?

For uninterrupted SpeedFusion tunnel operation during a single WAN link failure, all WANs should be set to the same priority level (typically priority 1). If WANs are set to sequential priorities, the tunnel will drop if any WAN fails, causing downtime. To maintain simultaneous, stable tunnels, ensure all relevant WANs and tunnels use the same priority. SpeedFusion does not automatically adapt to real-time WAN speed fluctuations; instead, it uses the upload/download speeds configured in WAN properties to allocate traffic across links. If these configured speeds are set lower than the actual WAN capability, SpeedFusion performance will be throttled; if set higher, it does not increase tunnel speed but may mislead traffic distribution. Therefore, best practice is to set bandwidth values in the WAN properties that accurately reflect each WAN's real-world performance. This ensures optimal load balancing and prevents unintentional bottlenecks. For specialized traffic (e.g., SIP), outbound policies can direct traffic to specific tunnels for enhanced performance. In summary, technicians should: (1) set all active WANs to the same priority for failover resilience, (2) accurately configure WAN bandwidth values, and (3) use outbound policy rules to steer critical traffic as needed.

How does R Link Connect leverage dual modem hardware, multi-carrier support, and SpeedFusion technology to maximize connectivity and reliability for users, and what are the related plan options and device features?

R Link Connect maximizes connectivity and reliability by combining dual modem hardware, multi-carrier support, and SpeedFusion technology. Dual modem devices (such as the R Link Duo) can connect to two carrier networks simultaneously, which enhances bandwidth and provides redundancy—if one carrier has issues, the other maintains the connection. R Link Connect operates as an MVNO across all four major US carriers (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and US Cellular), with automatic switching to the strongest or most reliable network based on location and coverage, ensuring optimal connectivity and reducing downtime. SpeedFusion technology is supported on both Solo and Duo devices, enabling advanced bonding and failover for even greater reliability. For users without existing Peplink hardware, R Link Connect offers a rental model with options for low-end, 5G, and dual modem routers, and the ability to own the hardware after 12 months. Plan options include 100 GB, 300 GB, 500 GB, and unlimited data, with increased data availability and speeds prioritized to avoid throttling, especially for dual modem devices. The system is designed for ease of use, with plug-and-play setup, labeled antennas, and the option to access advanced features via the device dashboard.

How do configuration choices such as QoS settings, VLAN tagging, and PPPoE influence the achievable throughput on the Peplink Balance One/Core, and what troubleshooting steps have been shown to restore or improve performance in these scenarios?

QoS settings, VLAN tagging, and PPPoE can all significantly reduce the achievable throughput on the Peplink Balance One/Core. Enabling QoS features or certain application priorities (like setting Remote Desktop to High Priority) can cut throughput by up to half, as observed by users who saw bandwidth drop from over 450Mbps to about 260Mbps; removing or resetting these settings restored performance. Similarly, enabling both PPPoE and VLAN tagging on fiber connections can reduce throughput to around 323Mbps, while removing these features and connecting the router as a child device to the ISP's router allows for much higher speeds (over 550Mbps). High CPU utilization during speed tests (often reaching 100%) is a common indicator that the router is struggling with these features enabled. Troubleshooting steps that have restored or improved performance include performing a factory reset, disabling or adjusting QoS settings, downgrading or upgrading firmware, removing VLAN tagging and PPPoE when possible, and testing with different firmware versions (including beta releases).

A Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini is stuck on 'Obtaining IP Address' with a Verizon SIM card that was previously activated and used in an iPhone. What are the multi-step troubleshooting steps and considerations a technician should follow to resolve the issue, including any carrier-specific requirements?

When a Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini is stuck on 'Obtaining IP Address' with a Verizon SIM card that was used in an iPhone, technicians should follow a series of troubleshooting steps. First, confirm that the correct APN setting is used; for Verizon, this is typically 'vzwinternet'. Next, verify the SIM card compatibility and account settings: many phone SIMs, especially those activated in smartphones, may not be compatible with data-only devices like the Pepwave, and Verizon voice-capable SIMs often do not work in routers. Ensure the Pepwave device is certified for use on Verizon's network and that the SIM is tied to a data-only plan. If the SIM is not compatible or the plan is incorrect, acquire a data-only SIM and plan from Verizon for proper operation. Additionally, check that the firmware is up to date, try both SIM slots, and reboot the device after making changes. If the issue persists, contacting Verizon's second-level support or a local Peplink partner may be necessary for further assistance.

How should a technician configure a Peplink router to enable management of a Starlink dish via 192.168.100.1, and what troubleshooting steps should be considered if access fails?

To manage a Starlink dish via a Peplink router, first ensure the router is running the special firmware version 8.1.1s118, as this firmware enables management access to the dish. Connect the Starlink dish to a WAN port and set the WAN Connection Method to DHCP/NAT mode, with automatic DNS enabled. Assign a management IP address for the LAN client in the range 192.168.100.2 to 192.168.100.254, and leave the subnet mask at its default value. After applying these settings, access the Starlink management interface at 192.168.100.1 from a LAN client.

If you cannot access 192.168.100.1, ensure that you have applied the correct firmware and configuration. For Balance routers, you may need to set up outbound policy rules (source: Any, destination: 192.168.100.1, Enforced algorithm to Starlink WAN), and add 192.168.100.1 as an additional IP, plus create NAT and firewall rules. However, some models (e.g., Balance One) are not compatible with this firmware feature. Also, note that the Starlink dish may not respond to pings except during boot, and browser compatibility issues may require trying Microsoft Edge if Chrome or Brave do not work. For reliable firmware updates, use a wired (Ethernet) connection rather than Wi-Fi or Mac.

How can a hotel network using Peplink Balance Routers ensure that guest users do not exceed their allocated bandwidth, especially when using PepVPN tunnels and facing issues with individual bandwidth limits and QoS settings?

To ensure that guest users do not exceed their allocated bandwidth in a hotel network using Peplink Balance Routers, particularly when traffic traverses PepVPN tunnels, the following steps are recommended: 

First, configure Individual Bandwidth Limit settings for each user group (e.g., guests and staff). However, be aware that some routers only allow a uniform limit for all clients, and group-based limits or reservations may not be fully supported, especially on models like the MK2. For traffic routed over PepVPN tunnels, it is necessary to set upload/download values on the tunnel itself, as the default direction of traffic (LAN to tunnel) can cause the limits not to apply unless adjusted. Additionally, ensure you are using a firmware version that addresses known issues with QoS and bandwidth limits; firmware version 8.1.2 is under development to improve this. Finally, if issues persist, consider using bandwidth limit features over SpeedFusion tunnels, as these are known to be effective for bandwidth control in hotel environments.

What are the requirements and limitations for enabling live vessel GPS tracking in InControl using a Starlink antenna, and what security or privacy concerns may arise in this setup?

To enable live vessel GPS tracking in InControl using a Starlink antenna, you must be running supported router firmware (such as version 8.4.1), and you need to activate Starlink in the WAN settings of the router. Additionally, in your Starlink account, you should set the 'location request mode' to local and ensure the GPS feature on the Starlink antenna is enabled. There may be limitations in GPS support if the router model does not have integrated GPS, which could affect the ability to display antenna location in InControl. For live tracking, each vessel typically resides in its own InControl organization, making it difficult to view multiple vessels on a single map without custom development or API usage. Privacy and security concerns include the possibility that giving users InControl login access could expose more information than intended, and features like Pepmin (remote assistance) can be a risk if not properly managed. Pepmin can be disabled for Peplink Support, but some users may prefer to disable it entirely and use only local device management. Additionally, there is limited logging of remote access or configuration changes made directly on the device unless those changes are made through InControl.

How does the built-in authoritative DNS server on Peplink Balance 210 and higher models facilitate inbound load balancing and failover, and what steps are involved in configuring this feature for continuous service availability?

The built-in authoritative DNS server on Peplink Balance 210 and higher models enables inbound load balancing by distributing incoming data traffic across multiple WAN links to servers behind the router. When a client queries for a domain, the DNS server returns the IP addresses of all available WAN links. If both WAN links are operational, both IPs are returned for load balancing; if one WAN goes down, only the operational IP is returned, enabling failover. The DNS server can automatically update DNS records to reflect WAN status changes, ensuring continuous availability regardless of whether the WAN IPs are static or dynamic. Configuration can be done by setting DNS records within the Peplink Balance device or by delegating a sub-domain from an external authoritative DNS server. For migration, modifications to the Name Server record at the Domain Registrar may be necessary. This setup does not allow a single client to use bandwidth from both ISPs simultaneously, but alternates connections based on availability, ensuring seamless service.

How do throughput limitations and WAN interface options differ among Peplink Balance 20, Balance 30, Balance 300, and Balance 20X models, and what are the practical impacts of these differences for a home or small business with multiple devices?

The Balance 20 and Balance 30 both have a throughput limit of 100 Mbps, with the primary difference being that the Balance 30 has an extra WAN port, supporting 3 Ethernet WANs versus 2 on the Balance 20. Both models also support 1 USB 3G/4G WAN for backup, and a bandwidth cap can be set on the USB interface to manage data usage. The Balance 300 is significantly older and limited to a maximum throughput of 20 Mbps, regardless of having three 100 Mbps WAN connections; its hardware restricts usable speed per user and in aggregate. The Balance 20X, in contrast, provides up to 900 Mbps throughput, making it suitable for modern home or small business networks with many devices (PCs, NAS, smart devices) demanding higher speeds. In practice, using a Balance 300 would result in much slower internet performance for all connected users, even if your internet connections are faster. The Balance 20 and 30 allow for full use of 100 Mbps connections, but would bottleneck if your ISP provides higher speeds. The Balance 20X avoids these limitations, enabling much higher aggregate speeds and better support for multiple devices with high bandwidth needs.

How do Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP), Per VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST), and Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MST/MSTP) improve upon the original Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), specifically in terms of port states, VLAN management, and convergence speed, and what are the relevant configuration or monitoring commands for these protocols on Cisco switches?

Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) improves upon the original STP by allowing for much faster network convergence and reduced port transition times. RSTP introduces new port states, such as alternate and backup ports, and enables all switches to send BPDUs, resulting in enhanced network awareness and faster failover. Vendor-specific enhancements like Cisco's Per VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST) and Per VLAN Rapid Spanning Tree (PVRST) allow each VLAN to run its own spanning tree instance, optimizing link utilization and providing more granular control over network topology. Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MST or MSTP) further improves scalability by grouping VLANs into instances, reducing the resource load on switches. For configuring and monitoring these protocols on Cisco switches, commands like 'spanning-tree mode' (to select STP, RSTP, or MST), 'show spanning-tree' (to monitor spanning tree state and port roles), 'show spanning tree mst' (for MSTP status), and shortcuts for setting root bridge priorities per VLAN are used. Features such as Port Fast and BPDU Guard are also recommended to optimize edge port activation and prevent loops when edge ports are misconfigured.

A technician is troubleshooting why a Peplink Balance 380 router with a gigabit WAN circuit achieves only around 290 Mbps throughput during speed tests, despite correct bandwidth and MTU settings. What are the most likely causes for this bottleneck, and how do hardware revision limitations and CPU usage factor into the observed performance?

The most likely causes of the observed throughput bottleneck (around 290 Mbps) on a Peplink Balance 380 with a gigabit WAN circuit are hardware revision limitations and high CPU usage during speed tests. Hardware versions of the Balance 380 prior to HW6 are limited to lower maximum throughput rates (170–200 Mbps), and while some users observe up to 290 Mbps, this is above the official rating and likely represents a practical ceiling under optimal conditions. High CPU utilization (100%) during speed tests is also reported, which causes the router interface to become non-responsive and further limits achievable speeds. Testing different MTU values (1440, 1500, 1530, 1580) does not improve throughput, ruling out MTU misconfiguration as the bottleneck. The CPU overload during high-bandwidth use is a direct consequence of the hardware's processing limits. To achieve gigabit speeds, upgrading to a newer hardware revision (HW6 or newer), which officially supports up to 1 Gbps throughput, is necessary.

What are the key considerations and potential performance implications when configuring High Availability (HA) between two Peplink Balance devices with different hardware revisions, and what firmware requirements must be met?

You can configure High Availability (HA) between two Peplink Balance devices with different hardware revisions (such as the Balance 380 or Balance 1350), but it is recommended to use matching hardware revisions for best compatibility and reliable HA functionality. If different hardware revisions are used, both devices must run the same firmware release, specifically the latest version supported by both units. Mixing hardware revisions may result in differences in feature sets (such as LACP availability) and performance (e.g., throughput), which can negatively affect failover performance. Using newer hardware may provide performance improvements, but during failover, the system will be limited by the capabilities of the older or less capable device. Therefore, for optimal HA operation, it is advised to replace older hardware to match the newer device.

How do the modem chipset differences between the Peplink Max BR1 Pro 5G, Max BR1 Pro Cat 20 LTE, and Max BR2 Pro 5G affect their 5G network compatibility, future-proofing, and performance, particularly with respect to carrier aggregation and spectrum support for AT&T and other major networks?

The Peplink Max BR1 Pro 5G uses Qualcomm’s X55 modem, which supports both 4G and 5G networks and enables features like five times carrier aggregation for downloads and three times for uploads, providing improved performance. However, the X55 lacks support for AT&T’s upcoming mid-band 5G spectrum (Andromeda Spectrum), which limits its future-proofing and compatibility with AT&T’s advanced 5G network, though it still performs well with current 4G and 5G bands on all major carriers. The Max BR1 Pro Cat 20 LTE model uses a Cat 20 LTE modem, which is limited to 4G LTE and does not support 5G or advanced carrier aggregation available in newer chipsets, but is considered the pinnacle of LTE technology and remains a viable, robust choice for users waiting for more advanced 5G capabilities.

The Max BR2 Pro 5G initially featured dual X55 modems, but in its updated version now uses the Qualcomm X62 modem chipset. The X62 brings significant improvements: it supports multi-band 5G carrier aggregation, including the combination of low and mid-band frequencies, and crucially, adds support for AT&T’s Andromeda Spectrum and additional international 5G bands. This ensures better performance and greater future-proofing, especially for AT&T customers, and compatibility with 5G Phase 2 as the technology evolves. Both BR1 Pro 5G and BR2 Pro 5G support Wi-Fi 6 and advanced antenna configurations, but the BR2 Pro 5G, with its dual X62 modems and multi-WAN capabilities, is better suited for high-performance, multi-carrier, and future-proof mobile connectivity scenarios.

How can a technician optimize the configuration of a Peplink router using SpeedFusion to bond two Starlink connections and provide LTE failover, while maximizing bandwidth for critical applications such as video conferencing or VPN, and what practical limitations and configuration adjustments should be considered?

To optimize a Peplink router with SpeedFusion for bonding two Starlink connections and providing LTE failover, the technician should connect both Starlink connections to the router’s WAN ports and use SpeedFusion for bonding, which allows for aggregated bandwidth and seamless failover to LTE. For critical applications like video conferencing or VPN, configure outbound policies to route this traffic through the SpeedFusion tunnel, enabling features such as WAN smoothing for reliability. However, WAN smoothing duplicates traffic and introduces overhead, potentially reducing usable bandwidth. SpeedFusion and its cloud or FusionHub components typically have a throughput cap of around 200 Mbps, which may limit the benefit of bonding two high-speed Starlink links. Load balancing can be used for non-critical devices to maximize total available bandwidth without the overhead of bonding. Performance may also be limited by backend constraints such as Starlink’s own network or the WAN backhaul. Proper configuration of health checks and failover priorities ensures that LTE is only used when both Starlink links fail. To avoid further limitations or packet loss, ensure that WANs do not have overlapping IP subnets and consider using bridge mode on Starlink terminals. For real-time applications, enable WAN smoothing at an appropriate level, but for higher throughput, disable smoothing and use dynamic weighted bonding. Regularly monitor bandwidth usage and adjust SpeedFusion configuration as needed for specific application priorities.

For a Pepwave BR1 Mini installed in an RV, what are the technical considerations and best practices for selecting and mounting an external antenna (such as the Puma 221), including how antenna characteristics, cable length, and router configuration affect connectivity performance?

When installing a Pepwave BR1 Mini in an RV, using an external antenna like the Puma 221 can significantly improve cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity. The Puma 221 is a 5-in-1 omnidirectional antenna providing up to 7 dB gain, with connections for two cellular antennas (for MIMO), two Wi-Fi antennas (one unused on single-band routers like the BR1 Mini), and one GPS. Omnidirectional antennas are recommended for RVs because they do not require aiming and can maintain connectivity while in motion. For optimal signal quality, antennas should be mounted as high as possible and above deck, ideally with a separation of 1.5 meters between antennas to reduce interference and enhance MIMO performance. Cable runs should be kept as short as possible, using high-quality cables (e.g., LM400) to minimize dB loss per foot and maintain signal strength. The BR1 Mini supports Cat 6 carrier aggregation for improved throughput and requires a full-size SIM designed for routers. Additionally, the device can be configured for failover and GPS tracking, with the GPS antenna included in the Puma 221. Proper antenna installation and cable management directly impact the achievable download speeds and overall connectivity reliability in mobile environments like RVs.

How does the transition from Qualcomm X55 to X62 modems in Peplink BR1 Pro 5G and BR2 Pro 5G routers affect support for AT&T's 5G networks, carrier aggregation capabilities, and future-proofing, and how can a technician distinguish between models with different modems?

The shift from the Qualcomm X55 to the X62 modem in Peplink BR1 Pro 5G and BR2 Pro 5G routers significantly enhances support for AT&T's 5G networks, carrier aggregation, and overall future-proofing. The X62 modem supports AT&T's Andromeda Spectrum and more 5G bands, which the X55 does not, making it better suited for AT&T's evolving mid-band 5G network. The X62 also enables advanced multi-band carrier aggregation for improved speed and range, particularly for users in fringe areas, while the X55 is limited in this capability. In terms of future-proofing, the X62 is compatible with 5G Phase 2 and international bands, ensuring ongoing compatibility as networks evolve, whereas the X55 lacks support for upcoming AT&T mid-band spectrum and may be less viable long-term. Technicians can distinguish between X62 and X55 modem-equipped models by checking the part or model number, with X62 units identified by a '5GN' suffix.

What are the key considerations and trade-offs when setting up antennas for a Pepwave Transit Duo Cat 12 or HD4-MBX Cat 18, particularly regarding the use of a single 4x4 MIMO dome antenna versus two separate 2x2 MIMO antennas, antenna spacing, and frequency tuning?

When setting up antennas for a Pepwave Transit Duo Cat 12 or HD4-MBX Cat 18, using a single 4x4 MIMO dome antenna for two modems is more convenient but can result in reduced performance compared to using two separate 2x2 MIMO antennas. The main trade-off is that a single 4x4 antenna may introduce interference, especially if both modems operate on the same carrier and frequencies, while two 2x2 antennas can better isolate signals and maximize throughput. For optimal performance, antennas should be spaced 1'-2' apart to minimize transmit interference, particularly for upload speeds. Though practical constraints, such as case size, may require closer spacing, this can negatively impact performance. Multiple antennas can share the same ground plane, like a large sheet of metal, without issue. Additionally, the HD4-MBX Cat 18's antenna ports are best tuned to different frequencies for optimal performance, and frequency allocation per modem can be managed manually to further reduce interference. In some setups, mounting antennas at different angles or on different levels within a single dome can help mitigate interference if space is limited.

How can a Pepwave/Peplink user accurately track and manage SIM card data usage across multiple devices and SIM pools, including setting custom allowance cycles, and what are the limitations and workarounds related to these features?

To accurately track and manage SIM card data usage across multiple Pepwave/Peplink devices and SIM pools, users can utilize InControl2 (IC2) and device-level reporting features available in firmware version 7.0.2 and later. Users can define multiple SIM pools for each IC2 group, set bandwidth quotas for these pools, and receive email notifications when quotas are reached. SIM pools are created by grouping IMSI numbers, and usage data is calculated and reported in IC2. If a new allowance cycle is required or the start date needs to be changed, the existing SIM pool cannot be edited; instead, users should create a new SIM pool with the same IMSIs, enter already-used data from daily usage reports, and then delete the old pool. On the device level, SIM reports are IMSI-based and help track data usage, but they do not show data like IMEI and MDN together. InControl2’s export tool and API services also provide IMSI-based usage data with endpoints for hourly, daily, and monthly usage. Users can set bandwidth monitoring cycles on certain router models (like Surf Soho), but there may be discrepancies if the bandwidth monitor is tied to the calendar month rather than the ISP billing cycle. While some firmware versions allow custom billing cycles for notifications, device-level reports may not always align with ISP billing cycles, so users may need to manually adjust data or use daily usage reports for reconciliation.

How does Peplink's SpeedFusion technology ensure reliable, high-performance internet by combining multiple types of WAN connections, and what additional features or configuration options are available to optimize connection quality and minimize disruption during failover or varying network conditions?

Peplink's SpeedFusion technology provides reliable, high-performance internet by bonding multiple WAN connections—including fixed, cellular, and even Starlink links—into a single robust connection. This bonding improves both bandwidth and redundancy, as traffic can be dynamically shifted between connections in response to failures or changing network conditions, minimizing disruptions even during live calls or streaming. SpeedFusion operates on a hierarchy with PepVPN as the foundation, supporting advanced features like Hot Failover (which keeps sessions active during link failures), SpeedFusion Bonding (which aggregates bandwidth), and WAN Smoothing (which duplicates packets across multiple links to reduce packet loss and jitter). Users can further optimize performance using various traffic distribution algorithms such as Bonding, Lowest Latency, Weighted Round Robin, and Overflow, tailoring the connection to prioritize speed, reliability, or cost. The InControl2 cloud platform and mobile apps allow for remote configuration, monitoring, and reporting, while features like One Smoothing and dynamic weighted bonding help maintain consistent performance for real-time and high-bandwidth applications. When connections of varying quality are used, SpeedFusion’s configuration should be adjusted to prevent unstable links from degrading the overall experience. Failover timing can be influenced by settings like Connection Timeout and Health Check intervals, and dual-SIM or dual-radio device setups further ensure continuous connectivity.

When troubleshooting frequent 'WAN failed DNS test' drops on a Peplink Balance 20 with cable modem WAN connections, what multi-step process involving health check settings, hardware configuration, and diagnostic review is recommended, and what underlying causes and workarounds have been identified?

To troubleshoot frequent 'WAN failed DNS test' drops on a Peplink Balance 20 with cable modem WAN connections, start by reviewing and adjusting the WAN health check settings—such as timeout, interval, retries, and the reliability of the health check server—to avoid false positives. Next, ensure that physical connections are secure and consider setting fixed port speeds (for example, 1000M full duplex) to address potential Ethernet handshaking or auto-negotiation issues between the Peplink and the modem. If issues persist, insert an unmanaged switch (like a TP-Link TL-SG105) between the modem and the Peplink router, which has been shown to eliminate disconnections in some cases. If the problem continues after these steps, consider replacing the modem itself, as faulty or incompatible modems have been identified as a root cause. Additionally, review device event logs and experiment with different DNS servers for the health check. These steps help determine if the issue is with the router, the modem, the ISP, or the health check configuration.

How does SIM card compatibility and form factor differ for the Pepwave Max BR1 Mini across the provided documents, and what are the implications for users setting up multiple cellular plans or switching between models?

There is inconsistency in the documentation regarding the SIM card form factor for the Pepwave Max BR1 Mini. Some sources specify that the BR1 Mini uses a Mini-sized 2FF SIM card, while others state it now uses a nano SIM card. This discrepancy suggests that there may be hardware revisions or different regional models. The BR1 Mini supports two SIM cards, but only one can be active at a time, enabling users to manage multiple cellular plans by switching between them if one network fails. Users must provide their own SIM cards and data plans compatible with major carriers (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, etc.), and ensure they use the correct SIM form factor for their specific BR1 Mini hardware version. In contrast, other Pepwave models like the BR1 Pro and Pro 5G consistently use nano SIM cards. Therefore, users upgrading from the BR1 Mini to other models or replacing their unit should verify SIM card size requirements to avoid compatibility issues and may need to obtain new SIMs or adapters as needed.

How does the compatibility of T-Mobile's 100GB data plan vary across different Pepwave MAX Transit models and configurations, and what steps or workarounds have users found for persistent 'Obtaining IP Address' issues?

T-Mobile's 100GB data plan shows inconsistent compatibility with the Pepwave MAX Transit Duo. Many users report persistent 'Obtaining IP Address' issues when using this plan with the Duo, especially on CAT18 modems, where an escalated support case even suggested switching plans. Some users claim success with the Duo and CAT18, indicating variability possibly due to device model, firmware, or plan activation method. The plan reportedly works well with other Pepwave models such as the MAX Transit Pro and TST DUO Pro-E, and has been successful on Cat4, Cat6, CAT12, and 5G modems, but not reliably on CAT18.

The T-Mobile 100GB plan is reportedly designed for use with T-Mobile-supplied hardware like the Inseego hotspot, which may explain incompatibility with Pepwave devices. As a workaround, the Duo can be set up as a repeater for a compatible hotspot. For initial activation, some users have found that using the router's SIM Toolkit feature to activate via SMS is necessary. Additionally, users are advised to verify band compatibility and may need to escalate support tickets with Peplink or T-Mobile for device-specific issues. For those unable to resolve the issue, switching to Verizon or AT&T prepaid hotspot plans has provided reliable service on the MAX Transit Duo.

A technician is troubleshooting a Pepwave BR1 Mini or Max LTE router that is consistently providing much slower speeds over WiFi and LTE compared to mobile phones or other routers using the same SIM card and in similar signal conditions. What multi-step diagnostic and remediation approach should the technician follow, considering both hardware, software, and environmental factors?

The technician should conduct a comprehensive troubleshooting process covering both hardware and software aspects, as well as environmental factors:

1. Confirm that the Pepwave BR1 Mini/Max is operating on the correct network type (preferably 4G LTE, not 3G). If it's connecting on 3G, this can explain significantly slower speeds compared to devices using 4G LTE.
2. Check the signal quality, particularly SINR, RSRQ, and Ec/Io values. Even if signal strength (e.g., RSSI/RSRP) is good, poor signal quality due to high noise (e.g., low SINR, high Ec/Io) can cause slow speeds. Improving antenna placement, using directional antennas, or reducing local RF interference can help.
3. Verify that all antennas (cellular, diversity, and WiFi) are properly installed and connected. Reposition antennas and the device as needed.
4. Update the firmware of the Pepwave BR1 to the latest recommended version (at least 8.0.2 for the Mini, or as advised in support documentation). Also, check and update the cellular module firmware via the support page.
5. For WiFi performance issues, check for loose WiFi antennas, try changing the WiFi channel (avoid congested channels), and consider interference from nearby devices (phones, baby monitors, etc.). Adjust WiFi transmit power up or down as needed, and set the proper WiFi region.
6. If using WiFi-WAN and acting as an access point simultaneously, performance may degrade due to hardware limitations (single-band, no MIMO, alternating packet flows). Using a separate device for LAN WiFi is recommended for best performance.
7. If persistent low throughput is observed even after these steps, consider possible hardware limitations (CAT4 modem, older hardware), and compare with other devices. If the unit still underperforms relative to expectations, consider RMA/replacement.

How can a technician configure a Pepwave MAX Transit Duo to achieve true bandwidth aggregation (bonding) across both cellular SIMs for SpeedFusion VPN traffic, and what are important practical considerations and potential limitations?

To achieve true bandwidth aggregation (bonding) using both cellular SIMs on a Pepwave MAX Transit Duo for SpeedFusion VPN traffic, the technician must first ensure SpeedFusion bonding is enabled on the Transit Duo. This requires accessing the web UI and enabling the feature under the SFC Protect tab, and the device must have a PrimeCare SKU or trial SpeedFusion Cloud for setup. The technician should bond the two cellular connections, ensuring both modems are active and each is using a SIM card from a different ISP for redundancy and increased speed. To complete bonding, a SpeedFusion tunnel must be established to a remote endpoint, which could be a SpeedFusion Cloud instance or a self-hosted FusionHub Solo (free license) on platforms like AWS or Azure. Outbound policies should be configured to direct traffic through the bonded SpeedFusion tunnel, avoiding session persistence or single WAN policies that could restrict aggregation. WAN Smoothing should be disabled to maximize throughput, as SpeedFusion bonds traffic at the packet level. Practical considerations include potential throughput limitations due to CPU and packet overhead, with real speeds potentially lower than aggregate modem maximums (e.g., ~80Mbps observed in practice). Additionally, the technician must note that SpeedFusion Cloud may have its own limitations and that session-based outbound policies can prevent full aggregation. The Transit Duo’s hardware supports simultaneous dual modem operation and is designed for rugged mobile use, making it suitable for applications needing high availability and uninterrupted data.

If a technician is trying to activate a Verizon SIM card for use in a Pepwave MAX-BR1-MINI-LTEA-W-T or MAX-BR1-MINI-LTE-US-T and encounters issues with obtaining an IP address or Verizon not recognizing the device's IMEI, what troubleshooting and workaround steps are recommended, and what factors related to device certification, SIM type, and carrier policy should be considered?

When activating a Verizon SIM card in a Pepwave MAX-BR1-MINI-LTEA-W-T or MAX-BR1-MINI-LTE-US-T, several challenges may arise, such as the device being stuck on 'Obtaining IP Address' or Verizon's system not recognizing the device's IMEI. First, verify that the Pepwave model is certified for use on Verizon, as only certified devices are reliably supported for activation and operation. Use a data-only SIM card and ensure the plan is compatible with routers, since voice-capable or standard phone SIMs often will not work in commercial routers like the Pepwave. If Verizon's system does not accept the device's IMEI or activation fails, a common and effective workaround is to first activate the SIM card in a Verizon-certified Jetpack or other Verizon device (using its IMEI), and then transfer the activated SIM to the Pepwave router. This method bypasses IMEI-related restrictions and facilitates successful activation and connectivity. Additionally, ensure the correct APN is configured for static IPs if needed, and consider resetting the Pepwave to factory defaults before activation. For persistent issues, escalate to Verizon's second-level support or consult the device's supplier or a Peplink partner.

How can Peplink's SpeedFusion technology be configured to maximize reliability and bandwidth when combining Starlink and WISP connections, and what additional features or settings can further optimize VPN and VOIP performance in such a setup?

Peplink's SpeedFusion technology can be configured to bond Starlink and WISP connections, maximizing bandwidth and reliability by combining both WAN sources. The recommended setup is to prioritize routing all traffic through Starlink for normal operations and only use the WISP connection when Starlink is down, which preserves the limited bandwidth of the WISP service. This can be achieved through outbound policies that prioritize Starlink and health checks on the Starlink connection to trigger failover to WISP when needed. For high-availability applications like VPN and VOIP, specific outbound policies can direct relevant traffic through the SpeedFusion tunnel. Additional features like WAN smoothing (set to Normal) and Forward Error Correction (set to Low) can be enabled to reduce packet loss and jitter, though WAN smoothing may need to be disabled if it causes instability. Health check settings (e.g., 3 failures with a 4-second TTL every 5 seconds and recovery on 1 good check) further optimize failover responsiveness. Tools like Tcpdump or Wireshark can be used to identify main DNS domains for applications, ensuring proper QoS and routing. This configuration has been shown to provide seamless failover, with VPNs and VOIP calls maintaining stability even during Starlink outages.

How should a technician optimize a Peplink Balance 580 setup that aggregates both satellite and DSL lines, to maximize speed and minimize latency issues?

To optimize a Peplink Balance 580 aggregating both satellite and DSL lines, the technician should avoid aggregating satellite and DSL connections together because the satellite's high latency will negatively impact the overall speed and latency of the connection. Instead, satellite links should only be grouped with other satellite connections, while DSL (landlines) should be combined with cellular or similar low-latency connections for better performance. Outbound policy settings such as Weighted Balance should be used to effectively distribute traffic across the multiple WANs, taking into account the differing speeds and characteristics of each connection. Furthermore, browser-based speed tests are not reliable for aggregated connections, especially when satellite is involved, since they typically use a single session and will not fully utilize all available WANs. For optimal results, it is best to configure the satellite as a backup connection only, so it is only used if the faster, lower-latency DSL or cellular connections become unavailable.

How can an organization continue to use InControl 2 (IC2) cloud-based management for Peplink devices after warranty expiration, and what are the technical and licensing considerations for different device models and features?

After a Peplink device's warranty expires, it will no longer be manageable via InControl 2 (IC2) unless the organization takes further action. To restore or maintain IC2 management access, the organization must either renew the device's warranty or purchase an IC2 subscription/license if available for that model. For smaller device models, standalone IC2 subscriptions can be purchased, sometimes at a lower cost than full warranty renewal. For larger devices such as the Balance 210 and above, warranty renewal (often via SmartCare) is required as IC2-only subscriptions are not available for these models. If the warranty or IC2 subscription lapses, the device will appear offline in IC2 and cannot receive new configuration pushes until coverage is restored, but pre-existing configurations on the device remain unaffected. All devices must also run firmware version 6.x or higher to be recognized by IC2. Purchasing or renewing the appropriate license or warranty will restore full management functionality, including centralized configuration, reporting, firmware management, and remote troubleshooting features.

What steps should a technician follow to reliably upgrade a Peplink Balance 30 router from firmware version 5.3.12 to version 8.1, and what possible issues should they check for if the upgrade fails?

To reliably upgrade a Peplink Balance 30 from firmware version 5.3.12 to 8.1, the technician should first upgrade the device to an intermediate version, specifically 5.4.9, and then proceed to 7.1.0 before finally upgrading to 8.1.0. This process may require downloading archived firmware versions from the Peplink support downloads archive and using the manual firmware upload feature if the online upgrade fails. If the upgrade fails at any stage, the technician should check that both routers are the exact same hardware revision, as hardware differences can affect firmware compatibility and upgrade paths. Additionally, verifying that the correct and compatible firmware image is used and ensuring the firmware upload process completes successfully are critical. If the device fails to upgrade and remains on the previous firmware version, it may be necessary to reboot the router and attempt the upgrade process again.

What steps and considerations are involved in troubleshooting connectivity issues with AT&T SIM cards on the Pepwave MAX Transit 5G, and what alternative solutions have users reported?

When troubleshooting AT&T SIM connectivity on the Pepwave MAX Transit 5G, first verify that the SIM is activated and check the device status through the local interface (Status > Device). If the router does not recognize the SIM automatically, manual configuration of the APN and other settings may be required, but even with correct settings, some AT&T SIMs—especially the prepaid 100GB plan—may connect at 3G, receive an IP address, but not pass data. This may be due to the MAX Transit 5G not being certified by AT&T, as the device is not listed on AT&T’s certified marketplace. Firmware updates can sometimes resolve these issues, as users have reported successful 5G connections with AT&T SIMs after applying a support-provided firmware upgrade. As a workaround, some users have achieved functionality by placing the AT&T SIM in a Nighthawk Pro 5G hotspot (which connects at 5G), then connecting the hotspot’s LAN to the Transit 5G’s WAN port. It is also noted that different AT&T SIM plans (not prepaid 100GB) may connect directly to the Transit 5G without issue.

How do the Qualcomm X55 and X62 modems used in Peplink's BR1 Pro 5G and BR2 Pro 5G routers differ in terms of 5G network compatibility, performance, and future-proofing, and what are the practical implications for AT&T users and advanced deployment scenarios?

The Qualcomm X55 and X62 modems represent two generations of 5G technology used in Peplink’s routers. The BR1 Pro 5G router uses the X55 modem, which supports 5G and 4G networks and performs well on current 5G deployments but lacks support for new mid-band 5G frequencies, particularly AT&T’s Andromeda Spectrum. This limits its future compatibility as AT&T expands its 5G network. The X62 modem, found in the BR2 Pro 5G and newer BR1 Pro 5G variants, brings improved performance, compatibility with a wider range of 5G bands—including those critical for AT&T’s future network—and supports advanced carrier aggregation, allowing the combination of multiple frequency bands for greater speed and coverage. The X62 is also compatible with 5G Phase 2, ensuring longer-term future-proofing.

For AT&T users, the X62 modem’s support for the Andromeda Spectrum is crucial for accessing enhanced speeds and coverage as AT&T deploys its new mid-band 5G network. In advanced deployments, such as mobile environments or complex multi-WAN scenarios, the X62-based BR2 Pro 5G offers dual 5G modems, multi-band carrier aggregation, more antenna ports for improved signal, and advanced SpeedFusion technology for bonding connections, making it better suited for demanding use cases and ensuring compatibility as networks evolve.

What are the recommended steps and configuration changes to fully separate a Peplink device from Peplink servers for enhanced security, and what additional actions can be taken to minimize data contact according to best practices?

To fully separate a Peplink device from Peplink servers for increased security, you should disable the InControl option and ensure that remote support is turned off. For heightened security, it is also recommended to restrict status reporting to only essential information and to disable any SpeedFusion Connect Protect services. Additionally, some users choose to block all communications with Peplink resources using the device's built-in firewall, an upstream firewall or appliance, or DNS solutions such as PiHole. A detailed write-up is available that outlines every setting that can be adjusted to further minimize connectivity with Peplink servers. These steps collectively reduce the device's data contact with Peplink, thereby enhancing security during potential vulnerabilities or as an ongoing privacy measure.

How can the Peplink Balance 20/30 series be configured to direct specific types of traffic or devices through designated WAN connections, and what are the implications for session integrity and load balancing behavior?

On the Peplink Balance 20/30 series, you can use outbound policy rules to direct specific machines, devices, or types of traffic (such as FTP) through designated WAN connections. To do this, go to the Network settings and set the Outbound Policy to 'Managed by Custom Rules' (or 'Custom'). Retain the default rules like 'HTTPS Persistence' and 'Default', and then add new rules specifying which LAN clients or traffic types should use particular WAN links. After creating these rules, save and apply your changes. This configuration ensures that traffic from specified devices or for certain applications is routed through the chosen WAN, without being subject to round-robin distribution, maintaining session integrity for connections such as FTP. By default, the device uses a weighted balance algorithm for load balancing based on downstream bandwidth, but custom rules override this behavior for matched traffic, allowing precise control over WAN usage.

How does VXLAN enable scalable multi-tenant data center networks, and what best practices and configuration considerations are necessary when integrating VXLAN with VPC and EVPN in a spine-leaf topology using Nexus switches?

VXLAN enables scalable multi-tenant data center networks by encapsulating Layer 2 traffic into IP/UDP packets over a Layer 3 underlay, using a 24-bit VNI to support up to 16 million segments—far exceeding traditional VLAN limits. This overlay architecture, commonly deployed on a spine-leaf topology, allows for flexible, scalable east-west traffic and seamless device mobility without IP address changes. Each VXLAN-enabled device includes a VTEP interface for encapsulation and decapsulation, and VXLAN can be used with both data plane and control plane (BGP EVPN) MAC address learning. BGP EVPN also allows for integrated routing and bridging, ARP suppression, and anycast gateway functionality, facilitating multi-tenant isolation and efficient traffic handling.

When integrating VXLAN with VPC on Nexus switches, it is essential to maintain a peer-link (PE link) between Nexus pairs to prevent loops and manage traffic. Loopback interfaces must be configured carefully, with secondary IP addresses identical on both switches, and separate loopbacks are recommended for BGP peering and NVE interfaces. Additional best practices include enabling spanning tree with a 4-second hello time, using delay restore for VPC recovery, and configuring backup routing SVIs for resilience. When using OSPF or other routing protocols, some models may require specific commands (like 'layer three periodic') to maintain stable adjacencies. For multicast handling of BUM traffic, set MTU values to accommodate VXLAN overhead, and use head-end replication or multicast as needed. In the context of multi-tenancy, create tenants with unique VLANs and VNIs, set up route distinguishers and targets in BGP, and verify isolation and connectivity through appropriate show commands. This approach ensures scalable, resilient, and efficient multi-tenant network operations in modern data centers.

A technician is troubleshooting why a user’s 400 Mbps internet connection only yields around 100-120 Mbps when routed through a Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3. What are the technical reasons for this behavior, what factors can further impact observed throughput, and what solutions are recommended if the user wants to achieve higher speeds?

The Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 has a maximum WAN/router throughput of 120 Mbps, which is a hardware limitation and not due to software or configuration. This cap explains why, even with a 400 Mbps or higher internet plan, throughput through the router will not exceed 120 Mbps, and real-world results may be even lower due to network conditions. Other factors influencing observed speeds include Wi-Fi band/channel, signal strength, interference, number of Wi-Fi streams, router load, number of configured rules, and the use of special features. Direct modem connections will show higher speeds because they bypass the SOHO’s throughput cap. If a user requires higher speeds to match a faster internet plan, the only solution is to upgrade to a more powerful router, such as the Peplink Balance One or Balance 20X, which support higher throughput under optimal conditions.

What are the precise firmware and network configuration steps required to reliably access the Starlink dish's web admin interface from a Pepwave or Peplink router, and what troubleshooting considerations should be kept in mind if connectivity fails?

To reliably access the Starlink dish's web admin interface (http://192.168.100.1) from a Pepwave or Peplink router, you must configure the WAN port connected to Starlink in DHCP/NAT mode, assign a management IP in the range 192.168.100.2-192.168.100.254, and ensure the router is running the special firmware version 8.1.1s118. Outbound policy rules should be set to direct traffic for 192.168.100.1 to the appropriate Starlink WAN interface before any SpeedFusion routing. The LAN and management IPs must not conflict with Starlink’s subnet. If you fail to access the Starlink admin page, check that your firmware is correct, your IP addresses are in the right subnets, and note that some Peplink models (e.g., Balance One) do not support this method. Also, the Starlink dish may only allow admin access for clients within its subnet, and connectivity may only be possible during initial boot-up. Static routes or NAT/firewall adjustments may be needed on certain models, and some users have reported issues even with correct firmware and settings.

How does the throughput limitation of the Peplink Balance 20 vary depending on hardware revisions and firmware versions, what is the recommended method to verify actual throughput, and when should a user consider upgrading to a higher model?

The throughput limitation of the Peplink Balance 20 depends on both the hardware revision and firmware version. The most recent hardware models running the latest firmware can achieve up to 150 Mbps throughput, while older models or those on earlier firmware may be limited to 100 Mbps. Some sources reference a 200 Mbps rating, but the majority of documents confirm 100–150 Mbps as typical. To accurately verify the device's real-world throughput, users should test the connection directly from a PC to the WAN port, avoiding measurements through intermediary switches that could skew results. Users should consider upgrading to a higher model, such as the Balance 305, when their WAN speeds, combined traffic demands, or client counts exceed the Balance 20's throughput capacity, especially if they require speeds above 150 Mbps, anticipate growth, or need advanced features like SpeedFusion bonding. Upgrading is also advised if the network regularly supports more than 25–60 users or is experiencing performance bottlenecks due to exceeding the Balance 20’s throughput or client capacity.

How should antennas be selected, connected, and configured for optimal cellular performance on Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini, MAX BR1 MK2, and MAX HD4 devices, considering diversity, MIMO, and redundancy, and what are the limitations or best practices for antenna sharing or backup?

For the Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini, connect antennas to both the Cellular Main and Cellular Diversity/Aux ports to fully utilize diversity receive for standard LTE, and MIMO capability for LTE-A, with the antennas spaced apart for optimal reception. Select high-quality, appropriately matched antennas—Peplink's mobility series is recommended for challenging environments, and a four-element antenna like the Mobility 40g may be used for the Mini 5G variant. For the MAX BR1 MK2, connect both MAIN and AUX ports with a good quality MIMO antenna, especially important for LTE-A/CAT6 modems, as the second antenna supports separate transmit/receive functions. The BR1 MK2 antennas are confirmed to support MIMO, which enables multiple input and output for better performance. For the MAX HD4, use a separate wired MIMO antenna for each modem connection, supporting up to eight connections (or 4 x MIMO antennas), and avoid sharing antennas between modems unless using high-quality hybrid couplers, as splitters may degrade performance or increase noise. Redundancy through antenna switching is not inherently supported for these models; instead, automated redundancy is available on multi-cellular models like the HD2 and above, managed by Peplink firmware. Manual antenna switching can be implemented with a solid-state relay for the BR1 MK2, but is not a best practice. Always keep antenna cables as short as possible to minimize signal loss, and consult the Peplink Antenna Selection Guide or a local partner for tailored solutions. Avoid relying on the auxiliary antenna for backup on HD4, as testing shows it does not provide failover if the main antenna is disconnected.

How does the Class 1 Division 2 (C1D2) certification status of the MAX-BR1 product line affect its suitability for oil and gas applications, and what are the current and expected certification statuses for the MAX-BR1, MAX-BR1-MINI, and MAX-BR1 Classic?

The Class 1 Division 2 (C1D2) certification is required for deployment in hazardous environments such as those found in the oil and gas industry. The MAX-BR1 does not currently have C1D2 certification, which restricts its use and sales potential in sectors that require this compliance. The MAX-BR1-MINI has already obtained C1D2 certification, making it suitable for such environments. The MAX-BR1 Classic is also currently uncertified, similarly limiting its suitability. However, the standard MAX-BR1 is expected to receive C1D2 certification around June 9th, which will make it viable for deployment in oil and gas applications that mandate this standard. Ongoing efforts are in place to request and obtain the necessary certification for these products, with updates to be provided via official channels.

If a technician is configuring a Pepwave mobile router for simultaneous use of Wi-Fi as WAN and cellular connections in a motor coach, what specific product models and configurations should be chosen, what hardware limitations and enhancements should be considered for interior and exterior Wi-Fi coverage, and what are the implications regarding throughput and licensing?

To achieve simultaneous use of Wi-Fi as WAN and cellular connections in a motor coach, the Pepwave Max Transit Duo (dual CAT-12 modems) or newer Pro/E variants are recommended, as the single CAT-18 model cannot support outbound policies for this scenario. For interior Wi-Fi, the Peplink AP One Rugged can be deployed, but in vehicles with stainless steel or glass, coverage outside may require additional access points or external antennas. The internal Wi-Fi radios can handle both Wi-Fi as WAN and WLAN, but this may reduce throughput. The Max Transit Duo and Pro/E models support SpeedFusion for bonding and failover, but bandwidth bonding may be limited by device CPU. Licensing (such as Primecare or SpeedFusion licenses) may be required for advanced features. The Max Transit Pro and Pro E also offer Power over Ethernet for adding access points, and have increased maximum throughput (up to 400 Mbps for Pro E and 1 Gbps for Pro). When using Wi-Fi as WAN and WLAN simultaneously, using an external access point or offloading Wi-Fi-as-WAN to another radio can help alleviate channel congestion and maintain performance.

How does the choice of Qualcomm modem (X55 vs X62) affect the capabilities and future-proofing of Peplink BR1 Pro 5G and BR2 Pro 5G routers, particularly regarding AT&T's 5G network, speed, and supported features?

The Qualcomm modem in a Peplink router significantly affects its speed, support for new 5G bands, and compatibility with future carrier network upgrades. The BR1 Pro 5G originally used the X55 modem, which supports 5G and Wi-Fi 6, offers up to 400 Mbps in real-world use, and provides up to 4x4 MIMO for 5G. However, the X55 does not support AT&T's upcoming Andromeda mid-band 5G spectrum, limiting its future use with that carrier. The newer X62 modem, now used in updated versions of the BR2 Pro 5G (and in the BR1 Pro 5G in some regions), offers multi-band 5G carrier aggregation, support for new international and US bands like AT&T's Andromeda, and is compatible with 5G Phase 2, ensuring better future-proofing. The X62 also delivers higher theoretical speeds, improved performance in fringe areas, and supports advanced features such as eSIM and dual modem configurations. Thus, choosing a model with the X62 modem ensures greater compatibility with future AT&T networks, higher performance, and longer device relevance compared to the X55-based models.

How does the number and type of load balancing algorithms supported differ between the Peplink Balance and MediaFast families, and what factors might cause discrepancies in reported capabilities?

The Peplink Balance family supports 8 load balancing algorithms, while the MediaFast family is commonly reported to support only 7. However, at least one model from the MediaFast family (MediaFast 500) actually supports all 8 algorithms, which matches the Balance family's capabilities. The discrepancy may be due to outdated specifications or datasheets, particularly with the most recently added algorithm, 'fastest response time.' Therefore, published specs may not always accurately reflect real device capabilities, and it is important to verify directly on the device or in the latest documentation.

How has support for load balancing algorithms evolved across the Peplink Balance and MediaFast product lines, and what are the implications for selecting a device based on algorithm availability?

The Balance MediaFast family was initially documented to support 7 load balancing algorithms, while the main BALANCE family supported 8, with 'fastest response time' being the most recently added algorithm. However, it has been confirmed that the MediaFast 500 actually supports all 8 algorithms, indicating that some documentation and datasheets may be outdated and that MediaFast devices can match the Balance series in load balancing capabilities. Therefore, when selecting a device based on the availability of load balancing algorithms, it is important not to rely solely on older datasheets, as MediaFast models may support the same algorithms as the main Balance series. Always verify current device capabilities and firmware features to ensure the required algorithm is available.

When powering a Pepwave MAX Transit Duo or CAT 18 using USB, how should the power supplies and connectors be used to ensure reliable operation, especially under higher load scenarios, and what are the common signs of insufficient power?

For the Pepwave MAX Transit Duo, power it using both USB connectors when possible, especially since the device requires a high current supply of 2.4 Amps. If using multiple lower current USB supplies, connect both to provide sufficient power. The MAX Transit CAT 18 has two USB ports each rated at 5V 2A (10W total), but since the device consumes 18W, both ports must be powered simultaneously to meet the requirement. Using two separate power sources also enables battery cycling without downtime. Under high load conditions, such as with two SIM cards installed and a tunnel active, the device may need more power than a single USB supply can provide. Signs of insufficient power include the battery light flashing red every 10 seconds, which indicates a voltage problem or faulty USB cable.

Which Peplink and MediaFast models support Jumbo Frames, and what are the key considerations regarding their deployment in mixed environments with models that do not support Jumbo Frames?

Jumbo Frames are supported on Peplink Balance 305 and higher models, as well as on the MediaFast 750. The Balance 310X does not support Jumbo Frames. The MediaFast 750 is functionally identical to the Balance 710, except it adds content caching, and it can be deployed in a network in place of the Balance 710. When deploying Jumbo Frame-capable devices in an environment that includes models without Jumbo Frame support, it is important to recognize that not all devices will benefit from or handle jumbo frames, which may impact network performance or require special configuration. For example, the Balance 310X, despite being a higher-end model, does not support Jumbo Frames, so mixing it with a Balance 305 or MediaFast 750 would require adjusting expectations or disabling jumbo frames on the network segment.

How does the built-in DNS server on Peplink Balance models enable inbound load balancing across multiple WAN links, and what steps and requirements are necessary to configure this functionality for high availability, especially when a WAN link goes down?

Peplink Balance models 210, 310, 305, 380, 580, 710, and 1350 have a built-in authoritative DNS server that enables inbound load balancing by distributing inbound data traffic over multiple WAN links to servers behind the router. This DNS server can be configured to manage DNS records for your domain, or a sub-domain can be delegated to the Peplink for this purpose. When a client queries the Peplink DNS server, it returns the IP addresses corresponding to available (live) WAN links; if one WAN link is down, only the operational WAN’s IP is returned. This ensures high availability because external users are always directed to online WAN links, and the router will not respond with IP addresses for offline WANs. DNS records can be managed directly within the Peplink, or you can delegate a sub-domain from an external DNS server. For this setup to work, each ISP should provide a static public IP address for their WAN connection, as dynamic IPs would change and disrupt DNS responses. The Balance 20 and 30 do not support this inbound load balancing functionality. If a WAN fails, there may be a delay before new DNS queries are directed to the alternate WAN, depending on DNS caching and device configuration, but ongoing service is maintained as long as at least one WAN is live.

How does the use of different SpeedFusion Cloud tunnels on a Pepwave MBX affect Netflix connectivity, and what factors related to IP addressing and routing should a technician consider when troubleshooting Netflix access issues?

When using SpeedFusion Cloud on a Pepwave MBX with multiple tunnels, the Default tunnel routes traffic through the MBX's cellular connections using ISP-provided IP addresses, which are less likely to be on Netflix's proxy filter blacklist. In contrast, the FEC tunnel routes traffic through the SpeedFusion Cloud hub, which provides different break-out IP addresses within AWS infrastructure. These IPs are more likely to be blocked by Netflix, leading to connectivity issues. Therefore, Netflix access may work over the Default tunnel but can be blocked when using the FEC tunnel. When troubleshooting Netflix issues, a technician should check which tunnel the traffic is routed through and verify that routing rules do not conflict with normal policy routing settings, as incorrect routing can further impact connectivity.

For a technician planning to deploy SpeedFusion VPN to bond and failover three WAN connections for a site with high reliability and bandwidth requirements, what critical configuration and hardware considerations must be addressed—including model selection, required licensing, encryption settings, endpoint placement, and the impact on bandwidth from overhead?

To deploy SpeedFusion VPN for bonding and failover of three WAN connections, the technician must first select Peplink Balance models that support SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding, such as the Balance 210, 310, or higher. The Balance 50, while having five WAN ports, does not support SpeedFusion and thus cannot bond WAN links. Models like Balance One and Balance 305 can be upgraded with a SpeedFusion license. SpeedFusion requires a VPN tunnel between two endpoints, which can be physical Peplink devices or a device and a FusionHub instance (e.g., on AWS). Only the hub site needs a public IP; remote sites can be behind NAT. Encryption for the SpeedFusion VPN can be disabled to reduce CPU load and VPN overhead, otherwise it defaults to AES 256-bit. Ports TCP 32015 and UDP 4500 must be open for tunnel establishment. The VPN introduces a bandwidth overhead of about 20%, due to packet headers and management. Both endpoints must be SpeedFusion-capable and configured for bonding; otherwise, only load balancing (not true bonding) will occur. The remote endpoint must also have sufficient bandwidth to handle the combined traffic. Careful configuration of outbound policies and failover rules is required for optimal reliability and performance.

What are the differences between IP passthrough and IP forwarding support on the Peplink Balance 310X, and what alternatives or related features exist for public IP handling on WAN connections?

The Peplink Balance 310X does not support IP passthrough on either the WAN or cellular interfaces according to firmware version 8.1.3 build 5162. However, it does support IP forwarding on the WAN side, which can be enabled in the WAN connection settings. If there is insufficient public IP availability (such as when using a /30 subnet for drop-in WAN), the 'Share Drop-In IP' feature should be enabled as an alternative to passthrough. Non drop-in WANs also support /30 subnets without issues. IP forwarding is a distinct feature from passthrough and requires separate configuration steps. For detailed guidance on enabling IP forwarding, users should consult the help prompts in the WAN settings interface.

How do the Peplink BR1 Pro 5G and Max BR2 Pro 5G routers differ in modem technology, dual modem capability, WAN/LAN port configurations, and support for future AT&T 5G networks?

The Peplink BR1 Pro 5G router is a single modem device and, depending on the version, uses either the Qualcomm X55 or X62 modem; the X62 version is future-proofed for AT&T's upcoming 5G mid-band (Andromeda Spectrum), while the X55 version lacks this and will not support future AT&T mid-band 5G. The BR1 Pro 5G has three Ethernet ports, including one 2.5 Gbps port that can be configured as WAN or LAN, and supports Wi-Fi 6. The Max BR2 Pro 5G is a dual modem device: earlier versions use two X55 modems, while newer ones use two X62 modems. The X62 modems support more 5G bands, including the Andromeda Spectrum for AT&T and 5G Phase 2, ensuring better compatibility with future networks. The BR2 Pro 5G features two 2.5 Gbps WAN ports and four LAN ports, offers USB tethering, and is designed for more rugged and mobile scenarios. In summary, the BR2 Pro 5G is more versatile with dual modem capability and more WAN/LAN ports, and the X62 version is better suited for future AT&T 5G support. When purchasing either model, users should confirm the modem version (X62 for future-proofing, identifiable by '5GN' in the model number).

How do antenna configurations and MIMO technology impact the performance and reliability of Pepwave routers across various models, and what are the best practices for optimizing antenna setups for models like the Balance 20X with Cat 18 modems and the BR1 Mini?

Antenna configuration and MIMO technology are critical for maximizing the performance and reliability of Pepwave routers. MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) technology, found across several Pepwave models including the BR1 Mini, BR1 MK2, and others, uses multiple antennas for simultaneous data streams, enhancing speed and signal reliability. For the Balance 20X with a Cat 18 modem, optimal performance can be achieved by using either a four-element LTE antenna like the Puma-401 or a pair of 2x2 MIMO antennas. Adding vertical separation between antennas is recommended, as it provides better signal diversity and reduces interference compared to simply rotating antennas. In marginal signal areas, using two directional 2x2 5G MIMO antennas spaced three feet apart vertically, with one rotated 45 degrees, can further improve reception. For models like the BR1 Mini, having dual cellular antennas supports effective MIMO operation, improving speed and reliability. Overall, proper antenna selection (matching modem category and carrier capabilities), appropriate physical separation, and leveraging MIMO technology are best practices to optimize router performance and reliability.

What steps and requirements must a technician follow to enable SpeedFusion Connect on a MAX Transit Pro E, and what management and monitoring features become available with the latest firmware updates?

To enable SpeedFusion Connect on a MAX Transit Pro E, the device must have eSIM capability, which is available on the Pro E but not on older models like the MAX Transit Duo. The technician must ensure the firmware is upgraded to version 8.2.0s011. After upgrading, SpeedFusion Connect can be enabled through the cellular WAN settings. With later firmware updates, such as version 8.3, additional features are available: Layer 3 connectivity for SpeedFusion Connect Relay to bridge private networks, dynamic SIM card switching via the InControl interface, and the ability to configure connection tests for daily speed monitoring. The SpeedFusion Connect app provides streamlined management for LTE data subscriptions, SIM management, and outbound policy configuration, supporting both consumer and enterprise users.

How should a technician bridge two separate LANs using a Pepwave Balance 210 and 380, ensuring correct routing and addressing, and what troubleshooting steps should be taken if communication fails?

To bridge two LANs, connect the WAN1 port of the Pepwave 210 directly to the primary LAN (on the Balance 380). Assign the 210's WAN1 an IP address within the primary LAN's subnet. On the Balance 380, add a static route for the secondary LAN's subnet (e.g., 198.42.232.0/24) pointing to the 210's WAN1 IP (e.g., 198.42.231.242). The 210 should act as a DHCP server for its LAN. Devices on the primary LAN should use the primary router (380) as their gateway. If communication fails, check the static route configuration and firewall rules on both routers. Run ping tests and traceroutes from the Balance 380's LAN interface to devices on the secondary LAN to diagnose connectivity issues. Also, ensure that the 210 has IP forwarding enabled and NAT disabled on WAN1, so it properly routes traffic between LANs.

What steps and considerations are involved in upgrading Peplink Balance 580 devices with different hardware revisions to firmware version 7.1.2, and what are the compatibility implications for SpeedFusion VPN setups when devices run different firmware or hardware versions?

To upgrade Peplink Balance 580 devices, you must first identify the hardware revision (HW1, HW2, or HW3) on the status page or by checking documentation. HW1 devices can upgrade directly to 6.3.4, while HW2 and HW3 can upgrade directly to 7.0.1. It is possible to upgrade from 6.3.1 to 7.1.2, and for many HW2 devices, 7.1.2 is the latest version available. The recommended upgrade path is to move from the current version to 6.3.4 or 7.1.1/7.1.2, then to 8.1.2 if supported, but not all hardware supports the same firmware versions. Appliances with different hardware revisions may not be able to run the same firmware version, as HW1 is limited to 6.3.4 and HW2 to 7.1.1 or 7.1.2. This mismatch can result in compatibility issues, especially for SpeedFusion VPN configurations that expect aligned firmware versions between devices. When upgrading, always take care with the sequence, particularly if SpeedFusion remote sites are connected, to avoid disruptions. Firmware archives are available for downloading earlier versions if needed.

How do you configure a Peplink router to manage a Starlink dish at 192.168.100.1, and what special considerations or limitations exist for certain Peplink models (such as Balance One), firmware versions, and client access methods?

To configure a Peplink router for Starlink dish management at 192.168.100.1, you must use special firmware version 8.1.1s118, set the WAN connection method to DHCP/NAT mode, and assign a management IP in the range 192.168.100.2–192.168.100.254. This setup allows LAN clients to access the Starlink dish management interface at 192.168.100.1. The subnet mask should remain at default, and automatic DNS is recommended. After saving and applying these settings, access should be possible. However, some Peplink models like the Balance One may not support this setup, with users reporting persistent connectivity and interface access issues despite correct configuration. Additionally, successful access can depend on the client device and browser used; some have found Edge works when Chrome or Brave does not, and firmware updates are more reliable via a wired connection. Outbound policy rules targeting 192.168.100.1 and static routes are sometimes tried for advanced troubleshooting, but Peplink does not allow WAN static routes on all models, which can further complicate management on devices like the Balance series. For some devices, Starlink may only respond to management requests during initial boot or to clients in its direct subnet. In such cases, using a secondary WAN or OOB switch is a possible workaround.

How does Peplink achieve bandwidth aggregation and reliable single-IP uploads for live streaming across multiple modems, and why is SpeedFusion Bonding preferred over IP spoofing in this scenario?

Peplink achieves bandwidth aggregation and reliable single-IP uploads for live streaming by using SpeedFusion Bonding technology. SpeedFusion Bonding allows the device to combine multiple internet connections from several modems, letting users upload data over all available connections while presenting a single source IP address to the streaming server. This ensures both increased reliability and bandwidth for uploads such as live video streams. IP spoofing, such as round-robin packet transmission with spoofed addresses, is not recommended because it cannot manage the underlying application streams effectively and does not provide the seamless aggregation or reliability that SpeedFusion Bonding offers. Additionally, Peplink Max 5G devices can use SpeedFusion VPN for bandwidth aggregation, but users should be aware that total bandwidth may fluctuate due to the variable nature of cellular connections, so the combined bandwidth is not a simple sum of all individual modem speeds.

What are the key configuration requirements and operational behaviors for implementing High Availability (HA) failover using VRRP on Peplink Balance 210 and above or MAX 700/HD devices in a 1+1 Backup (active-standby) setup, and what are typical failover times and considerations for LAN and WAN configuration?

To implement High Availability (HA) failover using VRRP on Peplink Balance 210 and above or MAX 700/HD devices in a 1+1 Backup (active-standby) setup, both devices must be connected to the same subnet and share the same HA group identifier. The configuration involves designating one device as master and the other as slave, setting a virtual IP (VIP) address as the default gateway for all LAN hosts, and ensuring both routers operate in the same mode (either NAT or Drop-in). The master device sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets to a multicast address; if the slave does not receive these packets within a specified interval, it takes over as master. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave to automatically copy settings from the master, or the slave can be configured manually. Failover typically takes 10-15 seconds, during which connectivity is briefly interrupted. For network resilience, additional Ethernet switches are recommended to avoid single points of failure. In NAT mode, the VIP must be set as the default gateway on all LAN devices; in Drop-in mode, no extra configuration is needed for LAN hosts. During failover, the slave’s WAN connections become active and use the same IP as the master.

A technician is troubleshooting a Pepwave MAX HD2 Dome with a Kuwaiti SIM card using a SIM Injector. What steps should they take to resolve connectivity issues, and what device compatibility and firmware considerations must they account for?

To troubleshoot connectivity on a Pepwave MAX HD2 Dome with a Kuwaiti SIM card using a SIM Injector, the technician should first update the SIM Injector firmware to the latest version (1.1.65) to ensure optimal performance and compatibility. They should also verify that the HD2 Dome is among the models currently compatible with the SIM Injector. Additionally, the technician should check for potential DNS issues in the DHCP settings on the LAN side, as these may cause connectivity problems even if the device appears online via IC2. If further issues persist, examining the physical SIM card installation and ensuring the SIM card size matches device requirements is advisable.

If a user with a Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 router upgrades their ISP connection to 1Gbps but still experiences speeds of only 100–120 Mbps on both wired and wireless clients, what are the main reasons for this limitation, and what upgrade options are available for achieving higher throughput?

The main reason for the speed limitation is the hardware throughput cap of the Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3, which is rated at 120 Mbps. This cap is determined by the device's hardware, not by software or configuration, so even with a 1Gbps ISP plan, the router cannot deliver speeds above its specified maximum. While real-world speeds may be even lower due to factors like WiFi interference, channel congestion, and the number of rules or special features enabled, the core throughput limit is set by the router's hardware. To achieve higher speeds, users should consider upgrading to a more powerful router. Peplink Balance One (supports up to 600 Mbps) and Balance 20X (supports up to 900 Mbps) are recommended for users needing faster connections. Actual speeds on these devices may still vary depending on network and environmental factors, but their higher throughput ratings are suitable for faster internet plans.

What are the main technical limitations and troubleshooting considerations when using multi-antenna 5G Pepwave devices (specifically MAX BR1 Pro 5G and MAX HD4 MBX), and how do antenna choice, firmware version, and device model affect Carrier Aggregation, signal display, and connectivity?

When using multi-antenna 5G Pepwave devices, both the MAX BR1 Pro 5G and the MAX HD4 MBX present specific technical limitations and troubleshooting considerations. For the MAX BR1 Pro 5G, users have reported that the dashboard may only display the carrier name, not the connection type, but the device generally remains connected to a 5G NSA band with occasional fallback to LTE. Firmware support is evolving: the device launched with firmware 8.1.3, with GA support planned for version 9.0.0; an 8.2.0 Beta 2 is also available. Using the correct antenna is important for optimal performance—pairing a Mobility 42G antenna with a MAX BR1 Pro 5G using a 6-foot SMA cable leads to minor signal loss (especially on low bands), but additional connectors can negate the benefits of shorter cables. For the MAX HD4 MBX, users face limitations such as the inability to select carrier or band, Carrier Aggregation not working (the device only uses one frequency despite multiple antennas), and absence of SNR display. These issues persist across multiple firmware versions (e.g., 8.1.1 and 8.1.2 RC3), and may relate to both software and hardware, possibly requiring hidden menus or special firmware. In summary, device model and firmware version crucially affect advanced features like Carrier Aggregation and signal reporting, while antenna choice and cable configuration impact signal strength. Troubleshooting should include checking firmware version, reviewing device compatibility with antennas, and considering known limitations in carrier/band selection and signal metrics display.

How do SpeedFusion capabilities and hardware differences between the Pepwave Max BR1 Mini (LTEA, Cat6) and the Max BR1 Pro 5G affect their suitability for high-reliability, high-throughput mobile applications such as live CCTV video streaming, especially when using external antennas like the Puma 221?

The Max BR1 Pro 5G is significantly better suited for high-reliability, high-throughput mobile applications like live CCTV video streaming than the Max BR1 Mini. The BR1 Pro 5G supports 5G connectivity and Wi-Fi 6, achieving cellular speeds up to 400 Mbps, and offers advanced features like dual 2.5 Gbps WAN ports and improved CPU performance, which enhance both speed and reliability. In contrast, the Max BR1 Mini (even in Cat6 form) is limited to LTE speeds up to 300 Mbps, has single-modem redundancy, and is constrained by less capable Wi-Fi hardware, especially in the LTEA/Cat4 models which are single-band and lack MIMO support. Both routers support SpeedFusion for hot failover and WAN smoothing, but performance is limited on the BR1 Mini by its hardware. Both can benefit from the Puma 221 external antenna, which provides up to 7 dB gain for cellular and Wi-Fi, but only dual-band models (like BR1 Mini Cat6 and BR1 Pro 5G) can fully utilize both Wi-Fi antenna leads. For optimal live video streaming, the BR1 Pro 5G offers higher throughput, better failover, and greater reliability in demanding mobile environments.

How does the support and configuration of load balancing algorithms differ between the Peplink Balance and MediaFast product families, and what practical implications does this have for network design?

The Peplink Balance family supports 8 load balancing algorithms, whereas the MediaFast family has been documented as supporting only 7. However, the MediaFast 500 actually supports all 8 algorithms, indicating that official documentation and datasheets for MediaFast products may be outdated or incomplete. The 'fastest response time' algorithm is likely the eighth and most recently added algorithm. For network design, this means that while both Balance and MediaFast 500 models can utilize the full range of load balancing algorithms, users should verify the firmware and documentation for their specific model to ensure access to all features. Relying solely on specifications or datasheets may lead to underutilization of capabilities, especially if planning to use advanced or recently introduced load balancing methods.

How can Peplink's InControl platform be used to centrally manage and secure a large distributed network, including password policies, firewall rules, Wi-Fi settings, firmware, and reporting, while supporting organizational segmentation and compliance?

Peplink's InControl platform enables centralized management of large, distributed networks by providing tools for secure device access, password management, firewall policy enforcement, Wi-Fi configuration, firmware updates, and comprehensive reporting. Administrators can generate unique, complex passwords and enforce two-factor authentication for device access.

Firmware can be centrally managed, including scheduling and rolling back updates, ensuring device consistency and minimizing downtime. Reporting features enable tracking of device, SIM, and Wi-Fi usage, while operational and event logs support compliance and troubleshooting. The platform supports organizational segmentation through groups, tenants, and role-based admin rights, allowing for the secure management of distinct business units or customers within the same infrastructure.

When integrating a Peplink Balance into an existing network using Drop-in Mode with only a /30 WAN IP subnet available, what steps should a technician take to ensure proper deployment, and what operational limitations or feature changes should be expected?

To deploy a Peplink Balance in Drop-in Mode with a /30 WAN IP subnet, the technician should use the Shared IP option, which is specifically supported for /30 configurations. Before beginning, verify that the device's firmware is up-to-date because older firmware does not support Shared IP in Drop-in Mode. Configure the Peplink by connecting a computer to a LAN port, accessing the web admin interface, and enabling Drop-in Mode via the network settings. Assign an appropriate LAN IP address, input the WAN gateway and DNS servers, and ensure the Shared IP option is selected under Drop-in Mode settings. After saving and applying the changes, connect the Peplink to the network and reboot routers and firewalls if necessary to update ARP tables. Note the following limitations and changes: only one WAN port can be used for Drop-in Mode, additional WAN connections will operate in NAT mode, and features such as PPTP server and High Availability are disabled when Drop-in Mode is active. The Peplink will transparently forward traffic between LAN and WAN1 without performing IP address translation, maintaining the firewall’s existing security policies. If there is no spare IP in the WAN subnet, the Peplink can share the existing IP address while still maintaining transparency.

How do firmware versions affect the availability and configuration of the WDS (Wireless Distribution System) option in Pepwave AP products, and what steps should a technician take if the WDS feature is missing after a firmware update?

The WDS option is not supported in firmware version 3.6.0, and it has been removed entirely from the web interface in firmware version 3.6 of Pepwave AP products. If a technician finds the WDS option missing after updating to version 3.6 or 3.6.0, the recommended step is to update (or revert) to firmware version 3.6.1 or 3.5.4, depending on the specific device and hardware revision, as these versions retain WDS functionality. For version 3.5.4, technicians should download the correct firmware matching their hardware revision from the Peplink support downloads archive. Skipping firmware versions may lead to missing features like WDS, so careful review of release notes and documentation is necessary before updating. Users have reported that some documentation still references WDS after its removal, underlining the importance of checking release notes for feature changes before performing firmware updates.

How does SpeedFusion VPN bonding with a Pepwave MAX router and Peplink Balance router support HD video streaming from a mobile field location to a CDN, and what are the key configuration and performance considerations for such a deployment?

SpeedFusion VPN bonding allows a Pepwave MAX router in the field to aggregate multiple cellular connections (e.g., 3G, 4G, or Wimax) and securely connect to a Peplink Balance router at a remote site (such as a datacenter), supporting the high bandwidth and reliability requirements of HD video streaming to a CDN. The MAX router combines the available WAN bandwidth, and the Balance router acts as a VPN endpoint and relay to the CDN. Bonding efficiency is approximately 90%, so the usable bandwidth is about 90% of the sum of the connected WANs after accounting for VPN overhead. SpeedFusion compensates for differing link speeds, latencies, and packet loss, intelligently routing traffic based on real-time link conditions. It is not necessary to use the same WAN types on each end; for example, the field may use cellular connections, while the datacenter can use wired links. The Balance 210 supports these deployments, but for more simultaneous Site-to-Site VPNs or higher throughput, the Balance 380 or higher is recommended. For cloud-based deployments, SpeedFusion Hubs can be hosted on AWS or Azure, and FusionHub servers may be used as VPN endpoints. Devices like the MAX Transit Duo support dual modems for redundancy and higher throughput. The overall performance depends on carrier bandwidth and the quality of the wireless environment.

How should a technician optimize a Peplink Balance 580 setup that aggregates both DSL and satellite WAN connections to maximize speed and reliability, and what outbound policy changes are recommended based on the observed issues with performance when both types of links are enabled?

To optimize a Peplink Balance 580 aggregating both DSL and satellite WAN connections, the technician should avoid aggregating satellite and DSL connections together in the same load-balanced pool, as the high latency of satellite links (around 800ms) can negatively impact overall speed and degrade performance, particularly for SpeedFusion VPN tunnels. Instead, satellite connections should be combined only with other satellite links, while DSL and landline connections can be grouped with cellular connections for better results. Outbound policy settings, such as Weighted Balance, can be used to distribute traffic more effectively across the five WAN connections, but satellite links should be set as backup rather than primary, due to their latency. This approach prevents the satellite connection from slowing down the entire network, which matches observed user experiences where disabling DSL lines sometimes resulted in better performance. Additionally, since browser-based speed tests may not accurately reflect aggregate throughput when multiple links are involved, the technician should use more appropriate testing methods to evaluate performance.

When configuring a Peplink 380 or Balance/MAX unit behind a firewall with SpeedFusion or PepVPN, what ports must be opened to support multiple tunnels and different firmware versions, and how does port usage change if UDP 4500 is unavailable or occupied?

To ensure SpeedFusion or PepVPN works on a Peplink 380 or Balance/MAX unit behind a firewall, you should open TCP port 32015 and UDP port 4500 for both inbound and outbound traffic. By default, SpeedFusion uses UDP 4500 for VPN data; if this port is occupied (such as by an active IPsec or L2TP with IPsec profile) or unavailable, SpeedFusion will use UDP 32015 or TCP 32015, and the next available ports (e.g., UDP 4501, 4502, or TCP/UDP 32016, 32017) for additional tunnels. Older firmware (before 5.4) or certain scenarios may require opening both UDP and TCP 32015. Custom port numbers within the 1–65535 range can be configured if needed. For PepVPN, port 32015 is used for handshaking, especially on firmware 6.2.1. Always test connectivity (e.g., using telnet on port 32015) and set inbound firewall and port forwarding rules accordingly.

If a user is experiencing a maximum speed of only 15Mbps on a Peplink Balance 300 with three WAN connections, each capable of 100Mbps, what is the likely cause, and how do device limitations impact throughput and domain capacity?

The likely cause of the 15Mbps maximum speed is the hardware throughput limitation of the Peplink Balance 300, which officially supports a maximum throughput of 20Mbps. Despite having three WAN connections that could theoretically provide a combined 300Mbps, the router itself cannot utilize more than 20Mbps total, and users have reported actual maximum speeds of 15Mbps as being normal for this device. In addition to throughput limits, the Balance 300 can only handle 20 domains according to its specifications, and users have found that it does not retain more than 71 domain names after a power cycle. These limitations are compounded by the device's age and lack of firmware updates, which may lead to unresolved bugs and missing features such as SMTP authentication required by modern ISPs.

What are the primary factors limiting the real-world throughput of the Peplink Balance One router, and what steps can be taken to optimize its performance based on user experiences and official recommendations?

The real-world throughput of the Peplink Balance One router is often limited by several factors including CPU saturation, Quality of Service (QoS) configuration, outbound policy rules (especially those using domain names), browser and testing method, number of WAN connections, and firmware version. Users consistently report that despite the router's advertised 600Mbps throughput, actual speeds achieved are frequently much lower, often in the 260–300Mbps range, especially when the CPU reaches 100% during speed tests. Specific QoS settings can halve the bandwidth, and using outbound policies with domain names may also reduce throughput. Additionally, using more than two WAN connections or enabling certain firmware features can further impact speed. To optimize performance, it is recommended to use the Edge browser on Windows 10 for speed tests, set speedtest.net to Single Connection mode, avoid logging into the router during testing, keep QoS and unnecessary features disabled, ensure the latest firmware is used (or revert if performance drops after an update), and, if issues persist, perform a factory reset or contact support. Also, test with different devices and monitor both the router's and the test device's CPU usage to rule out client-side bottlenecks.

If a technician wants to achieve seamless cellular bonding or failover using two different SIM cards from separate LTE providers in a Pepwave MAX BR1 Pro 5G, what are the device's capabilities and limitations, and what alternative hardware or configurations should be considered?

The Pepwave MAX BR1 Pro 5G has a single modem with two SIM slots, but only one SIM card can be active at any time. Therefore, it cannot use two SIM cards from different LTE providers simultaneously for bonding. Switching between SIM cards is possible, but there will be a brief connectivity loss (typically 1-2 minutes) during the transition, so seamless failover is not achievable. For actual cellular bonding or truly seamless failover between two SIMs, a device with two modems, such as the MAX Transit Duo, HD2, or BR2 Pro 5G, should be used. Alternatively, bonding can be achieved on devices with multiple modems by leveraging SpeedFusion technology. The MAX BR1 Pro 5G is also incompatible with the MAX Adapter 5G for adding an extra modem. For users needing to bond SIMs from different carriers simultaneously, hardware with multiple modems, such as the Balance 20X with a CAT18 module, is recommended.

How can SpeedFusion technology be used to achieve bandwidth bonding and automatic failover between two sites with multiple WAN connections, and what are the requirements and considerations for optimal performance based on Peplink device models and module limitations?

SpeedFusion can be used to bond bandwidth and provide automatic failover between two locations by establishing a SpeedFusion VPN tunnel between two SpeedFusion-capable Peplink devices. This enables the aggregation of multiple WAN connections from both sites, so a single network session can utilize the combined bandwidth, and if one WAN fails, traffic is automatically routed through the remaining connections. To set this up, each site must have a Peplink router that supports SpeedFusion; some models (such as the Balance 210 and above) support bonding, and the BR1 Pro and newer models are also compatible. The head-end device (the device acting as the SpeedFusion concentrator) must be appropriately sized to avoid performance bottlenecks. Bandwidth aggregation performance may be limited by hardware constraints, such as the shared bus architecture of the FlexModule Mini in the Balance 20X, which caps throughput at 150Mbps, or the device’s total throughput limits. For optimal performance, use higher-capacity modules and devices, like the Balance 380X or 580X, and consider deploying a FusionHub virtual appliance in the cloud to act as the SpeedFusion server for greater flexibility and scalability. Traffic can be configured to route either through the SpeedFusion VPN for bonding and failover or directly to the internet, depending on organizational needs. Additionally, Peplink’s SFC Protect cloud bonding service provides a managed SpeedFusion tunnel up to 200Mbps outbound, though it does not support inbound connections. Careful planning of bandwidth settings and hardware selection is essential for best results.

How can a technician configure a Peplink Balance 20/30 router so that specific machines or types of traffic (like FTP) always use a designated WAN connection, while ensuring that other traffic is balanced or prioritized across the available WANs, and what considerations should be kept in mind to avoid common pitfalls such as round-robin distribution or session integrity issues?

A technician should use the Outbound Policy feature on the Peplink Balance 20/30 series to direct specific machines or traffic types (e.g., FTP) to designated WAN connections. This is achieved by navigating to the Network settings, setting Outbound Policy to 'Managed by Custom Rules', and retaining the default rules 'HTTPS Persistence' and 'Default'. Custom rules can then be added to enforce that certain LAN clients or applications use a specific WAN. For example, an FTP server’s traffic can be directed to always use WAN1, ensuring session integrity and that return traffic uses the same WAN. For general traffic, the default outbound policy can be set to use balancing algorithms like Weighted Balance or Lowest Latency, which distribute other traffic across available WANs. To avoid issues such as round-robin switching (which can break session integrity for applications like FTP or VoIP), it is crucial to use 'Enforced' or 'Priority' algorithms for specific rules and to ensure that session-based traffic is not split across WANs. Changes must be saved and applied to take effect. Service passthroughs and protocol-specific settings (such as SIP Passthrough or ALG) may override outbound policies for certain traffic types, so these settings should be reviewed if experiencing unexpected routing behavior.

How do Peplink routers with firmware versions 8.4 and 8.5 optimize the use and integration of Starlink connections, and what related features enhance network reliability and management?

Peplink firmware versions 8.4 and 8.5 introduce and expand several features optimizing Starlink integration and overall network management. With 8.4, users can control Starlink routers directly from Peplink devices, such as rebooting and stowing the dish, and monitor Starlink status from the Peplink dashboard. Outbound policy based on uplink utilization is available for load balancing multiple Starlink connections. Firmware 8.5 enhances Starlink reliability by introducing obstruction awareness, which allows the router to maintain WAN connectivity and quickly recover from brief signal losses. GPS awareness enables routers to utilize Starlink GPS data for mapping and location services. Additionally, adaptive forward error correction dynamically adjusts data overhead on affected WANs, improving Starlink connection resilience. Both firmware versions offer expanded remote management capabilities through InControl, and features like failover mode and application queuing further enhance reliability and traffic prioritization. These improvements collectively optimize Starlink performance, increase uptime, and provide administrators with greater control and visibility.

What are the challenges and recommended steps for activating various Pepwave BR1 models (Mini, LTE-V-T, Pro 5G) on Verizon, considering both prepaid and postpaid plans, and what workarounds have been reported successful?

Activating Pepwave BR1 models on Verizon can present several challenges, especially on prepaid plans and when dealing with Verizon representatives unfamiliar with these devices. For all models (Mini, LTE-V-T, Pro 5G), obtaining an activated SIM card from Verizon is required, and the device's IMEI must be provided during activation. The BR1 Mini and LTE-V-T models may face issues with prepay activation due to Verizon's systems not recognizing commercial routers, and there may be a separate compatibility database for prepaid plans. In these cases, contacting Verizon support directly and providing all relevant device and SIM details is recommended. Workarounds include using the IMEI from a supported Jetpack device to activate a SIM, then moving that SIM to the Pepwave device, or clearing browser cookies and using the BYOD process on Verizon's website. Postpaid plans are more likely to succeed without complications. The Pro 5G has been successfully activated by using a Jetpack's IMEI for plan creation, after which the SIM worked in the Pepwave device. Always ensure the SIM card is the correct size for the device. Customer service may require guidance, and it is sometimes necessary to retrieve the IMEI from device settings rather than the label.

How does deploying a Peplink Balance in Drop-in Mode allow seamless integration with an existing network firewall, what are the configuration steps and limitations, and how does this setup affect traffic handling, security policies, and available features?

Deploying a Peplink Balance in Drop-in Mode allows the device to be inserted between the existing modem and firewall without requiring changes to the network configuration or firewall settings. In this mode, the Peplink acts as a transparent bridge, forwarding traffic between LAN and WAN1 without performing IP address translation (NAT), so the firewall's existing gateway and security policies remain intact. The installation involves connecting to the Peplink's LAN port, accessing the web admin interface, setting the LAN IP, enabling Drop-in Mode, and configuring WAN settings such as bandwidth and DNS. Only one WAN port can be used for Drop-in Mode, and features like the PPTP server and High Availability are disabled in this configuration. If there are no spare public IP addresses, the Peplink can share an IP with the firewall to maintain transparency. Additional WAN connections operate in NAT mode by default, allowing for load balancing and failover without disrupting the current firewall rules. LAN bypass can be enabled to ensure continuity in case the Peplink loses power. After configuration, rebooting network devices may be necessary to update routing tables and ARP entries. The deployment ensures that the firewall continues to enforce security and VPN policies, while the Peplink handles multi-WAN traffic, load balancing, and failover transparently.

How does centralized management through the InControl platform improve configuration, security, and troubleshooting for Pepwave routers, especially when managing multiple devices or large deployments?

Centralized management via the InControl platform streamlines configuration by allowing users to push bulk configuration files to multiple devices at once, ensuring uniformity and compliance across large fleets. Configuration options, such as Wi-Fi SSIDs, VLANs, and outbound firewall rules, can be managed at the group or organization level and applied to all devices in a group, reducing manual errors and deployment time. Security is enhanced by features like centralized password management, two-factor authentication, and the ability to set firewall rules and country-based IP blocking for all devices. The platform facilitates troubleshooting by providing remote access to device status, WAN/LAN information, event logs, and bandwidth usage reports, which help identify and resolve network issues quickly. Additional features like zero-touch provisioning, scheduled firmware updates, geofencing for automated actions, and reporting on SIM/data usage further improve operational efficiency in large deployments.

What are the steps and required considerations for testing a specific older firmware version of FusionHub or Peplink Balance web interface in a cloud or virtualized environment, including licensing, network configuration, and access?

To test an older version of the Peplink Balance web interface, you can deploy FusionHub in the cloud and apply a free Solo license. If you need to reuse a license key for a new FusionHub instance, you must first 'Release' the license; this does not require an active warranty or subscription. However, if the warranty or subscription expires, InControl2 management features like configuration and bandwidth reporting will be unavailable. To verify the license key for FusionHub on Windows Server 2012, ensure UDP port 5246 is open in your firewall for the specified IP addresses. Deployment can be done on supported virtualization platforms such as VMware ESXi or Microsoft Hyper-V, and for VMs using Hyper-V (for example, in UniFi Talk or VLAN setups over SpeedFusion), proper virtual switch and firewall rule configuration is necessary to ensure traffic is routed and allowed as needed. Finally, while InControl can be used to manage VMs and FusionHub instances, some features may be limited if the warranty or subscription has expired.

How does the Peplink Max BR2 Pro 5G with the Qualcomm X62 modem improve performance and future-proofing for users needing robust mobile connectivity, and what features support its advanced connectivity compared to earlier models with the X55 modem?

The Peplink Max BR2 Pro 5G equipped with the Qualcomm X62 modem improves performance and future-proofing by supporting multi-band 5G carrier aggregation, which allows the device to combine different 5G bands for better speed and range, especially in fringe areas. The X62 modem includes support for more 5G bands, including international ones and AT&T's Andromeda Spectrum, ensuring compatibility with future 5G networks (5G Phase 2). This contrasts with previous models using the X55 modem, which do not support AT&T's upcoming mid-band 5G and therefore have more limited long-term capabilities. The BR2 Pro 5G features dual 5G modems, four nano SIM slots for cellular redundancy, two 2.5 Gbps WAN ports, Wi-Fi 6, USB WAN for tethering, and multiple antenna ports, enabling the aggregation of up to seven WAN connections for robust, high-speed mobile internet. It is designed for rugged environments and provides flexible power options, remote management with InControl2, eSIM support, and is suitable for vehicles, boats, and other demanding installations.

Which SFP+ and SFP modules are compatible with the Peplink Balance 2500, and what speeds and physical media types do they support? Additionally, can the Balance 2500-2SFP operate at 1Gbps with SFP modules?

The Peplink Balance 2500 has been tested with a variety of SFP+ and SFP modules from Avago, Finisar, and Intel, supporting both single rate (10Gbps) and dual rate (1Gbps/10Gbps) speeds. Compatible modules include Avago's AFBR-700SDZ (10G SR single rate), AFBR-703SDZ-IN1 and AFCT-701SDZ-IN1 (dual rate 1G/10G SR/LR), ABCU-5710RZ (1000 BASE-T SFP), and Finisar's FTLX8571D3BCL, FTLX1471D3BCL (10G SR/LR single rate), FCLF8522P2BTL (1000BASE-T SFP), and FTLX8571D3QCV-IT (dual rate 1G/10G SR). Intel modules such as AFBR-703SDZ-IN2 (dual rate 1G/10G SR) are also compatible. The Balance 2500-2SFP model supports dual rate SFP+ modules, which can operate at 1Gbps, and its SFP ports can accept 1Gbps SFP modules, allowing connection to 1Gbps switches. These modules support multiple physical media types, including SR (short-range, multimode fiber), LR (long-range, single-mode fiber), and 1000 BASE-T (copper Ethernet).

How does deploying FusionHub on different cloud platforms (such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Digital Ocean) impact setup requirements, licensing, and network performance, and what should technicians consider when routing multiple VLANs through a FusionHub instance in a private cloud?

Deploying FusionHub on different cloud platforms requires platform-specific setup steps, licensing considerations, and awareness of network performance factors. On AWS, users need knowledge of EC2, VPC, and must disable source/destination checks and enable IP forwarding; they must also consider licensing, as FusionHub allows one free peer and additional peers require a purchased license. Microsoft Azure deployment requires creating a storage account, uploading the .vhd image using PowerShell, and defining network parameters in deployment scripts. Digital Ocean is supported with a specific price point ($5/month for 1TB). Licensing across platforms follows the same model, with options like FusionHub Solo for a free single peer. Network performance is affected by data center proximity, with lower latency achievable by choosing nearby regions, and outbound data charges may apply on platforms like Azure. When routing multiple VLANs through FusionHub in a private cloud, technicians must ensure the local router can route between VLANs, enable 'Route PepVPN traffic to LAN' on FusionHub, add static routes pointing to FusionHub as the gateway for SpeedFusion subnets, and adjust outbound policies on Peplink devices to enforce VLAN traffic routing through FusionHub.

How should a technician configure Peplink SpeedFusion technology to optimize reliability and performance when bonding Starlink and cellular connections for live streaming or real-time applications in a mobile environment?

To optimize reliability and performance for live streaming or real-time applications using Peplink SpeedFusion with both Starlink and cellular connections in a mobile environment, a technician should: 1) Use a Peplink router compatible with SpeedFusion (such as the Max Transit Pro E or BR2 Pro), ensuring it supports both Starlink and cellular WANs. 2) Enable and properly configure SpeedFusion bonding, prioritizing real-time traffic (e.g., Zoom, Teams, live sports) across both links. 3) Apply Forward Error Correction (FEC) and/or WAN Smoothing in SpeedFusion profiles to mitigate Starlink’s typical 1% packet loss and enhance session stability during failover or variable network conditions. 4) Create multiple SpeedFusion profiles if needed, tuning outbound policies and latency cutoffs for each application type to optimize bandwidth and minimize jitter and latency. 5) Set the Starlink WAN’s MTU to 1500 and health check interval to 10 seconds to stabilize the connection and avoid false downtime. 6) Consider using features like Dynamic Weighted Bonding (DWB) for better bandwidth management in 5G environments and Synergy mode if combining multiple Peplink devices. 7) Monitor connection metrics via the admin console and adjust load balancing, failover, and traffic prioritization as network conditions change, ensuring uninterrupted, high-quality streaming even in challenging or mobile conditions.

When installing a Maritime 20G antenna with two cables on a MAX BR1 Pro 5G, which antenna ports should be used, what configuration mode should be set on the router, and how do recommendations differ between sources?

When connecting a Maritime 20G antenna with two cables to a MAX BR1 Pro 5G, there are two main recommendations for port connections. One source advises connecting the antenna cables to ports A and D and setting the device to '2 antenna mode' for optimal performance. Another source recommends connecting the cables to ports A and C and suggests using the two included plastic antennas in the remaining connectors. Both approaches are designed to optimize signal reception, but differ in which ports they assign to the Maritime 20G cables. The recommended configuration mode in one case is '2 antenna mode,' and both approaches involve using the Maritime 20G's two cellular cables (the antenna has 2 cellular and 1 GPS cable).

If you want to achieve true WAN bonding (not just load balancing) on a Peplink Balance One or Balance One Core, what licenses and endpoints are required, what are the differences between using SpeedFusion Cloud, FusionHub, and another Peplink device, and under what circumstances is a SpeedFusion license not needed?

To achieve true WAN bonding (where multiple internet connections are aggregated for increased bandwidth) on a Peplink Balance One or Balance One Core, you need to set up a SpeedFusion VPN tunnel to a suitable endpoint. For bonding with another Peplink device or a FusionHub virtual appliance, you must purchase the SpeedFusion Bonding License (SKU: BPL-ONE-LC-SF) for the Balance One or Balance One Core. This license enables multi-WAN bonding functionality; without it, you can only use SpeedFusion on one WAN at a time or just load balancing. At least two endpoints are required for bonding: the local Balance device and either another physical Peplink device, a FusionHub instance, or Peplink’s SpeedFusion Cloud. If you use SpeedFusion Cloud, you do NOT need to purchase a SpeedFusion license for the Balance One or Balance One Core—this is included in the service. SpeedFusion Cloud is the easiest option for most users and is suitable for bonding multiple DSL or other WAN connections. FusionHub may require its own license after a trial period. Load balancing across WAN ports is possible without any SpeedFusion license, but this is not the same as bonding. In summary: you only need a SpeedFusion license for the Balance One/One Core if you are bonding with another physical Peplink device or FusionHub; you do not need it for SpeedFusion Cloud.

A client needs to achieve at least 1.9 Gbps throughput with dual 1 Gbps fiber/cable connections and is considering the Peplink Balance 310X, Balance 380, or Balance 380X. They also want LACP support to maximize throughput to a core switch, and IPv6 capability. Which model(s) should they select, what are the relevant limitations, and what alternative or future-proof options exist?

To achieve at least 1.9 Gbps throughput using dual high-speed (1 Gbps) connections, the Peplink Balance 380X is the recommended model, as it supports a firewall throughput of 3 Gbps and provides LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) support, enabling aggregation of multiple links to a core switch. The Balance 310X can handle the throughput requirement but does not support LACP, so it cannot aggregate links for a single client or uplink. The original Balance 380 only has 1 Gbps firewall throughput, making it unsuitable for the 1.9 Gbps requirement. It is important to note, however, that LACP does not allow a single client to exceed the speed of an individual link (e.g., 1 Gbps), as it balances flows, not aggregate bandwidth for a single flow. If a single client needs more than 1 Gbps, 10Gb networking between the router and client is necessary. Regarding IPv6, there is a lack of clarity and concern about Peplink's IPv6 support on the Balance 380X, as this has not been addressed for several years. For future-proofing or higher port speeds, newer models like the BR1 PRO 5G with a 2.5 Gbps WAN port may be considered, though this is not a direct alternative for LACP. In summary, choose the Balance 380X for dual 1 Gbps aggregation and LACP, but be aware of the limitations for single-client throughput and uncertain IPv6 support.

How should a technician configure a Peplink router, including firmware, WAN settings, and network addressing, to enable management access to a Starlink dish at IP 192.168.100.1, and what additional steps may be necessary if direct access fails?

To enable management access to a Starlink dish at 192.168.100.1 through a Peplink router, the technician should first install special firmware version 8.1.1s118, which is required for this feature. The WAN port connected to the Starlink dish must be set to DHCP/NAT mode with an automatic DNS. The management IP address for the LAN client (or router interface) should be configured within the range 192.168.100.2 to 192.168.100.254. After saving and applying these settings, the management app should be accessible at 192.168.100.1. If access fails, the technician can create an outbound policy with source set to Any and destination 192.168.100.1, using the Enforced algorithm to direct traffic to the Starlink WAN. In some scenarios, static routes to 192.168.100.0/24 via the Starlink gateway may be required, or using a secondary router or VLAN setup for out-of-band management. It's also important to note that the Starlink dish may only respond to management traffic during initial boot or may require packets to be addressed to its MAC, in which case advanced troubleshooting (such as ARP checks or using a secondary switch) may be necessary.

How can a technician configure the Peplink Balance 20X to support three simultaneous wired WAN connections, what are the expected throughput limitations for each connection, and what steps must be taken to ensure all connections are active and configurable in the device interface?

To configure the Peplink Balance 20X for three simultaneous wired WAN connections, use the Ethernet WAN port for the first WAN, configure one LAN port as a Virtual WAN for the second, and connect a USB Ethernet adapter for the third WAN. The expected throughput for the Ethernet WAN and Virtual WAN can reach up to 1Gbps each, while the USB WAN connection is limited to 200-300 Mbps. After physically connecting the USB adapter, ensure it is recognized in the Status section; a new entry in Network settings may not appear until the adapter is properly configured and an active link is established. If the link is inactive, it may be due to nothing being plugged into the adapter. All three connections can be managed and traffic balanced using SpeedFusion and outbound policies.

What are the required steps and considerations for configuring a Peplink router to manage a Starlink dish at IP 192.168.100.1, including firmware, IP addressing, WAN settings, and common troubleshooting issues?

To manage a Starlink dish via a Peplink router, you must first install special firmware version 8.1.1s118, which enables access to the dish at 192.168.100.1. Configure the router's WAN port to use DHCP/NAT mode with automatic DNS, and set the management IP address for your LAN client within the range 192.168.100.2–192.168.100.254. After saving and applying these settings, you should be able to access the Starlink dish's web interface at 192.168.100.1. If having trouble, create an outbound policy with source 'Any' and destination 192.168.100.1, using the Enforced algorithm directed to the Starlink WAN. Note that some models, such as Balance One, may not support this setup, and the Starlink IP may not always respond to pings except during initial boot. Firmware updates are more reliably performed via a wired (Ethernet) connection than Wi-Fi or Mac. Some users report web browser compatibility issues, so try Microsoft Edge if Chrome or Brave do not work. In some cases, the Starlink device may restrict admin access to clients within its subnet, which can further complicate management access.

What are the key technical steps and important configuration considerations when deploying Peplink FusionHub on Microsoft Azure, and what potential issues or best practices should technicians keep in mind?

To deploy Peplink FusionHub on Microsoft Azure, technicians should begin by creating a Resource Group to organize all resources, followed by establishing a Storage Account and Container for uploading the FusionHub VHD image. The .vhd file, downloaded from Peplink, must be uploaded using PowerShell 7 with the Azure Az Module, as AzureRM is deprecated. Once uploaded, a managed disk is created from the VHD, and a FusionHub virtual machine is launched from this disk. Networking resources, including a Virtual Network, must be set up, and IP forwarding should be enabled on the FusionHub network interface for remote access. For convenience and consistent access, a DNS name can be assigned to the VM, although public IP addresses may change after restarts.

Technicians should define relevant variables in their PowerShell scripts to streamline deployment and should be aware of Azure's potential outbound traffic charges and how data center proximity can affect latency. Security is also a concern—ensure that firewall rules are properly configured, as some platforms do not automatically provide one. Finally, after deployment, the FusionHub Admin Page is accessible via the public IP or DNS name, and further instructions are available for connecting Peplink or Pepwave devices to enable SpeedFusion.

How do differences in LTE connection quality and configuration affect SpeedFusion tunnel performance, and what troubleshooting steps are recommended to optimize speed and reduce packet loss when using two LTE connections of differing quality?

SpeedFusion tunnel performance is often limited by the quality of the weaker LTE connection when bonding two LTE links of different performance. Instead of achieving the sum of both links’ speeds, the tunnel typically averages the speeds, and overhead further reduces effective throughput. High latency or packet loss on one connection can significantly degrade overall tunnel speed. Signal quality metrics (RSRQ, RSRP, RSSI) and antenna configuration impact each LTE link's performance. To optimize speed and reduce packet loss, recommended troubleshooting includes: checking antenna placement and separation, monitoring each LTE connection’s metrics, using Latency Difference Cutoff to minimize the impact of the degraded link, testing for bottlenecks in the tunnel versus the LTE links, capping connection speed if necessary (especially if upload limits or bufferbloat are involved), and, if appropriate, trying Peplink’s 'Experimental' TCP mode for improved performance. If packet loss persists, ensure that external factors like the Fusion Hub or ISP are not responsible, as confirmed by direct modem-to-server tests.

A technician is advising a client with a home office and a 1Gbps fiber connection, considering either the Peplink Balance 20 or Balance 20X. If the client needs to support 25 wired users with high-bandwidth activities (like streaming and Zoom), which router is more appropriate and why? What throughput and feature limitations should be considered for each option?

The Peplink Balance 20X is the more appropriate choice for a home office with a 1Gbps fiber connection and 25 wired users engaging in high-bandwidth activities. The Balance 20X can support up to approximately 900 Mbps throughput and is designed to handle multiple wired users in demanding scenarios, whereas the Balance 20 is limited to 100–150 Mbps throughput depending on hardware and firmware, which can bottleneck a 1Gbps connection and is undersized for environments with 20–30 users. The Balance 20X also supports features such as multiple VLANs, up to 7 SSIDs, Bonjour forwarding, and integrated management through InControl2 with PrimeCare support. In contrast, the Balance 20 lacks the throughput and scalability required for such a setup and does not support user/group bandwidth limits or mesh networking. While neither option may reach the full 1Gbps, the Balance 20X is far better suited for high-bandwidth, multi-user environments than the Balance 20.

A technician wants to set up a resilient, high-bandwidth site-to-site VPN between two locations using Peplink devices and ensure seamless connectivity even during ISP WAN failures. What configuration steps and considerations should they follow, and how do SpeedFusion, firewall, and IP assignment practices across multiple documents contribute to an optimal setup?

To set up a resilient, high-bandwidth site-to-site VPN between two sites using Peplink devices, the technician should use SpeedFusion VPN rather than traditional IPSec, as SpeedFusion can aggregate bandwidth from multiple WANs and maintain VPN sessions with zero downtime during WAN failures. Both locations need Peplink devices that support SpeedFusion. The technician should configure bonding and failover features, which do not require extra licenses on models like the Balance 1350 or 2500, but should check licensing for other devices. For optimal performance, proper firewall rules must be set up to allow inter-site traffic; by default, Peplink firewalls may block this, so explicit inbound rules are needed to permit communication between the LAN subnets at both ends. If public IPs are assigned to internal clients, the Peplink should be configured so the upstream provider routes a block of public IPs to the device, the LAN is in the public IP range, and NAT/IP forwarding is configured appropriately. Finally, outbound policies can be used for load balancing and failover across WAN links, and the Peplink can serve as a DNS server for local devices. This setup ensures high availability and bandwidth aggregation, with secure, seamless connectivity even if individual ISP links fail.

When is the ACW-411 required for console or serial connections with various Pepwave BR1 models, and what issues or limitations are associated with using it on models other than the BR1 Mini?

The ACW-411 is only required for console (serial) connections with the BR1 Mini. For the BR1 Classic HW3 and MAX Transit Mini, a direct Ethernet cable from their serial port to the console port of the managed device is sufficient for out-of-band management—no ACW-411 is needed. There are issues when trying to use the ACW-411 with the BR1 Classic HW3: the link light does not activate as it does with the BR1 Mini, indicating incompatibility. Additionally, the ACW-411 is specifically designed for the MAX BR1 Mini and cannot be used on other MAX products like the BR1 or BR1 Mk2, which lack serial signaling. Other Pepwave models, such as the BR1-Slim, BR1-M2M, BR1-ENT, HD2-Mini, and Transit, include RS-232 interfaces for out-of-band management and do not require the ACW-411.

How should a technician set up Peplink Synergy Mode between two devices for centralized WAN management, and what are the necessary prerequisites and device roles?

To set up Peplink Synergy Mode, ensure both devices are compatible models (Synergy Controller: X, Balance, MAX, or UBR series; Synergized Device: Balance, MAX, or UBR series). Both must be running firmware version 8.3.0. The Synergy Controller must have an active Care Plan, while the first Synergized Device does not require one but any additional devices do. The primary (controller) should ideally be the latest model for best performance and must have at least one active WAN connection. Physically, connect the Synergized Device's LAN port to the Synergy Controller's WAN port via Ethernet. After firmware upgrade, reset the Synergized Device to factory settings. Enable Synergy Mode through the controller's web admin interface (network tab or WAN settings) and configure accordingly. Once enabled, the Synergy Controller manages all WAN interfaces (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Cellular) from both devices via a single dashboard, and admin access to the Synergized Device is through the controller using the same credentials.

When configuring a site-to-site VPN between two Peplink Balance routers (e.g., BPL 210 and BPL 30/310), what are the key configuration steps and troubleshooting actions needed to ensure successful LAN-to-LAN communication, especially if the VPN tunnel is established but hosts cannot be pinged across sites?

To successfully configure a site-to-site VPN between two Peplink Balance routers (such as BPL 210 and BPL 30/310), refer to the Balance and MediaFast User Manual for detailed setup instructions. After establishing the VPN tunnel (indicated by a green VPN icon), ensure both routers' LAN subnets are correctly configured and not overlapping. If you can ping the routers' LAN IPs but not other hosts, check the firewall settings: by default, the firewall may block cross-site traffic. Add inbound firewall rules on both routers to allow traffic from the remote LAN subnet (e.g., 192.168.0.0/24) to any destination. Additionally, verify VLAN and WAN settings to ensure there are no misconfigurations preventing LAN-to-LAN connectivity. If using InControl2 for remote management, confirm that the routers are registered and have their WAN configured with default settings for optimal remote operation.

What are the main factors that can limit LTE module throughput on a Peplink Balance 20X, and what steps should a technician take to achieve speeds greater than 100 Mbps with CAT12 or CAT18 modules?

The throughput of LTE modules on a Peplink Balance 20X is affected by several factors. The FlexModule Mini slot in the Balance 20X is limited to around 150 Mbps due to its shared bus architecture, and overall speed may be further reduced when using the internal 4G module or USB port simultaneously. Many users report that CAT4, CAT6, and CAT12 modules cap at 100 Mbps individually on this device, even though those modules can achieve over 200 Mbps on other hardware using the same LTE bands. The HW2 hardware revision only enables the DSL flex module, which can further limit LTE module performance. To achieve speeds over 100 Mbps, upgrading to a CAT18 module may help, but physical constraints of the Balance 20X architecture may still impose limits. For optimal performance with FlexModule Mini modules, using a Balance 380X or 580X is recommended. Additionally, technicians should ensure that SpeedFusion settings are not limiting performance, as it can sometimes introduce bottlenecks. Testing and configuration changes should be done to isolate whether the limitation is hardware or configuration related.

How do firmware version and SSL certificate updates interact to resolve 'Router Unreachable' and SSL errors in the Peplink Router Utility App, and what additional steps or limitations should a technician consider if problems persist after updating firmware?

To resolve 'Router Unreachable' and SSL certificate errors in the Peplink Router Utility App, updating the router firmware is a primary step because new firmware versions include updated SSL certificates with longer validity. For example, firmware 8.0.0 included a Comodo certificate valid until mid-November 2019, and firmware 8.0.1 introduced a new default certificate with extended validity. If the certificate is expired or invalid, upgrading to at least firmware 8.0.1 typically restores Router Utility app access. However, if issues persist after a firmware update, technicians should consider manually uploading a new local certificate, as the Public Root CA certificate (e.g., from Comodo) may also need updating, and not all issues are resolved solely by firmware changes. Some older devices no longer receive maintenance releases for certificate updates, so Peplink may not issue firmware updates solely for SSL certificate problems, requiring manual intervention. Additionally, enabling 'Compatibility Mode' in the Router Utility App settings can help restore app connectivity with some firmware and app version combinations. Technicians should also be aware that some devices may be stuck on specific firmware versions, limiting their ability to receive automatic certificate updates.

How do Peplink devices address the unique connectivity challenges faced by marine vessels, and what features enable them to optimize costs, maintain connectivity, and ensure secure remote access while at sea?

Peplink devices are specifically engineered to tackle the unique connectivity challenges encountered by marine vessels, such as geographical variability, movement between coverage zones, and the high costs of certain internet sources. They support up to 13 simultaneous WAN links, including satellite, cellular, WiFi, and fixed line services, and allow for prioritizing lower-cost connections to optimize expenses. Bandwidth monitoring and scheduled control of WAN usage help prevent overage charges and further optimize costs. Peplink routers support multiple SIMs and USB dongles, enabling the use of local networks and reducing roaming expenses. Intelligent algorithms allow these devices to automatically switch between available WAN links based on health, availability, and priority, ensuring continuous and seamless connectivity as vessels move. Local content caching, available on certain models like the MediaFast series, reduces bandwidth consumption by storing frequently accessed content onboard. Bandwidth management features, including filtering of high-usage applications and user-specific controls, further help to manage usage and costs. For secure remote access and resilient connectivity, Peplink’s SpeedFusion technology bonds multiple WAN connections into a secure VPN, enhancing reliability for critical applications such as VoIP, video calls, and remote system monitoring. These features collectively enable marine operators to maintain robust, cost-effective, and secure onboard connectivity regardless of changing environments.

How does the throughput limit of the Peplink Balance 20 vary by hardware and firmware version, and what are the practical consequences for users with high-speed WAN connections or multiple WANs?

The throughput of the Peplink Balance 20 depends on both hardware revision and firmware version. The oldest hardware revision is limited to 20 Mbps, while a newer revision with a metal enclosure supports up to 100 Mbps. The latest hardware revisions (such as R6) and current firmware increase the maximum throughput to 150 Mbps. However, even with multiple WANs, the total combined throughput cannot exceed this hardware limit. Users connecting the Balance 20 to WAN connections faster than the device's throughput limit (for example, 200 Mbps or 500 Mbps) will experience bottlenecking, high CPU usage, and potential unresponsiveness during large downloads. To address this, it may be necessary to upgrade to a higher-capacity router such as the Balance One or 20X, or to configure bandwidth throttling and use multi-stream speed tests to accurately assess true performance. Actual observed throughput may be significantly lower than the rated maximum under real-world conditions.

If a user upgrades their internet service from 100 Mbps to 400 Mbps but continues using a Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3, what limitations will they encounter, and what factors influence whether they will see any increase in speed? Additionally, what are the recommended upgrade options for taking advantage of the higher bandwidth?

When a user upgrades their internet service to 400 Mbps but continues to use a Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3, their effective network speed will still be limited by the router's maximum throughput of 120 Mbps. This throughput cap applies to WAN-to-LAN traffic, no matter the physical LAN port speeds. While the router supports Gigabit Ethernet ports for LAN and WAN, its internal routing performance restricts total data transfer rates between the internet and local devices. Wi-Fi performance may be further limited by factors such as band selection (2.4GHz vs. 5GHz), channel interference, and environmental noise, but even under optimal conditions, total throughput will not exceed 120 Mbps. Users may see even lower speeds in real-world usage due to these factors and the router's CPU limitations. To utilize the full 400 Mbps service, users should upgrade to a model such as the Peplink Balance 20X, Balance One, Balance One Core, or other Peplink routers that support higher throughput, with some supporting up to 350–600 Mbps or more.

How do firmware version, hardware revision, and network usage (including VPN and high-bandwidth WAN connections) collectively impact the real-world throughput and performance of the Peplink Balance 20, and what configuration or upgrade strategies can help mitigate performance issues in demanding environments?

The throughput of the Peplink Balance 20 is influenced by both firmware version and hardware revision, with the latest hardware and firmware supporting up to 150Mbps throughput. However, real-world throughput is often lower, especially when using VPNs: IPSEC VPN is limited to 30Mbps, and OpenVPN yields even lower speeds due to higher CPU overhead. High-bandwidth WAN connections (e.g., 500Mbps) can overwhelm the Balance 20, causing high CPU usage and unresponsiveness during large downloads. To mitigate these issues, recommended strategies include setting bandwidth caps or throttling high-speed WAN interfaces to around 120Mbps, using group bandwidth limits to prevent client overuse, and enabling the 'DSL cable optimization' feature to improve Bufferbloat performance. In cases of persistent CPU saturation and performance bottlenecks, especially with 20–30 users or heavy VPN usage, upgrading to a more powerful model like the Balance 20X, Balance One, Balance 210, or Balance 305 is advised.

When connecting a Pepwave MAX device (such as MAX Transit, BR1, or Max Transit Duo) to a public Wi-Fi network with a captive portal, what is the correct multi-step configuration process to ensure all LAN devices can access the internet, and what configuration changes should be made before and after login to support failover and DNS resolution?

To connect a Pepwave MAX device to a public Wi-Fi with a captive portal, start by setting the WiFi WAN as the highest or only active WAN (priority 1) and disabling health check on the WiFi WAN. Next, connect the device to the desired Wi-Fi network. Then, use a laptop or another device connected to the Pepwave's LAN to log in to the captive portal; once this is done, all other LAN devices will have internet access without needing to individually log in. For correct DNS resolution, ensure the DNS settings are set to obtain DNS from the WAN, rather than using hard-coded external DNS servers. After the captive portal login is complete, re-enable health check on the WiFi WAN if you want to allow automatic failover to cellular or other WANs when the public WiFi is unavailable.

How do the hardware capabilities and modem configurations of the Pepwave Max Transit Pro and Transit Pro E affect their real-world throughput, and what technologies or features can further impact performance in mobile or high-density environments?

The Pepwave Max Transit Pro and Transit Pro E both feature dual LTE modems (Cat 7 and Cat 12), but their hardware capabilities and configurations define their real-world throughput. The Max Transit Pro has a maximum throughput of 1 Gbps, enabled by an upgraded CPU and Wi-Fi 6 support, allowing it to achieve higher speeds and better performance in congested environments. The Transit Pro E, in contrast, maintains a maximum throughput of 400 Mbps due to hardware constraints, even though each Cat 12 modem supports up to 600 Mbps download. Both devices use dual SIM slots per modem, support carrier aggregation (2x for Cat 7, 3x for Cat 12), and utilize MIMO antenna technology for enhanced communication. Additional technologies like SpeedFusion, SD-WAN bonding, encryption, Forward Error Correction (FEC), and WAN smoothing introduce overhead that can further limit actual throughput. Wi-Fi 6 improves device performance in high-density settings and enhances battery life for clients. External antennas can boost performance in mobile scenarios by improving signal quality. Features like PoE, redundant power options, and advanced management platforms (e.g., InControl2) provide operational flexibility but do not directly increase throughput.

How does the Peplink Balance 20X compare to the Balance 30 LTE and Balance Two for creating a rural, redundant internet setup with Starlink and cellular or WISP backup, especially regarding SpeedFusion capability, WAN flexibility, and future-proofing for high bandwidth needs?

The Peplink Balance 20X is often recommended for rural, redundant internet setups using Starlink as primary with cellular backup. It features a built-in CAT4 LTE modem (with an option to add a higher-speed CAT12 LTEA module), one Ethernet WAN port, and a USB WAN for additional connectivity. The Balance 20X supports SpeedFusion with up to 100Mbps of bonded throughput, suitable for work-from-home, VoIP, and Zoom calls. It offers future flexibility by allowing the addition of another LTEA modem module.

The Balance 30 LTE is also suitable for combining Starlink with cellular or WISP backup, supporting multiple WANs and providing stable connectivity with SpeedFusion Cloud, but it lacks the built-in upgrade path for higher LTE categories and may not be as future-proof for increasing bandwidth needs. Balance 30 LTE users have reported success with Starlink and WISP, though for those who eliminate cellular, the 20X may be a better fit.

The Balance Two is recommended for setups with Starlink and WISP, with the option to add a cellular modem via USB. However, its SpeedFusion capability and throughput are not as clearly specified as the 20X, and it may be less optimal if built-in or easily upgradable cellular is required.

For higher bandwidth or more WANs, models like the 310X or 580X provide greater SpeedFusion throughput (600Mbps and above) and more WAN options, but at higher cost and complexity.

In summary, the Balance 20X provides a strong mix of built-in LTE, upgradable cellular, SpeedFusion bonding up to 100Mbps, and WAN flexibility, making it an excellent choice for rural Starlink/cellular or WISP redundancy, with good future-proofing for moderate bandwidth growth. Those with higher bandwidth needs should consider moving up to models like the 310X or 580X.

How have the SIM card form factors and slot configurations evolved across different hardware versions of the Pepwave Max BR1 Mini, and what implications does this have for users managing multiple data plans and upgrading to newer versions?

The Pepwave Max BR1 Mini has seen changes in SIM card form factors and slot configurations across its hardware versions. Early versions used full-size (2FF) SIM cards, while newer hardware (such as version 3 and Cat 7 models) have transitioned to using nano SIM cards. The BR1 Mini includes two SIM card slots, allowing users to manage multiple cellular plans, but only one SIM can be active at a time. This dual-slot configuration supports failover between plans, enhancing reliability for mobile internet access. Users upgrading from older to newer hardware must ensure their SIM cards match the required form factor—nano SIMs for the latest versions. This evolution means that while users gain the flexibility to switch between data plans seamlessly, they may need to replace or adapt their SIM cards when upgrading, and should confirm carrier compatibility for the chosen SIM size.

How do antenna selection, cable management, and SIM Injector deployment interact to optimize cellular router performance in both fixed and mobile Peplink installations?

To optimize cellular router performance in Peplink deployments, careful antenna selection, cable management, and SIM Injector placement are all crucial and interconnected. For both fixed and mobile installations, selecting the appropriate antenna (such as the Mobility or Maritime series for rugged or omnidirectional needs, or the 82G for high-performance 5G) is key. In mobile setups, cable runs should be kept as short as possible to preserve antenna gain, since excessive cable length (e.g., 30 feet of LMR 195 cable) can cause significant signal loss, reducing the effectiveness of even high-gain antennas. In fixed installations, Peplink recommends at least an 18-inch separation between antennas to minimize interference. The HD1 Dome design places the modem directly at the antenna, eliminating cable losses by sending the signal over Ethernet. The SIM Injector supports flexible SIM management for multiple routers (such as HD1 Domes), can power devices via PoE, and comes in models suitable for both small (8 SIM slots) and large-scale (up to 56 SIM slots, as with the Flex module) deployments. By combining optimal antenna placement and type, minimizing cable losses, and leveraging SIM Injectors for power and flexible SIM management, Peplink installations can achieve robust and high-performance cellular connectivity.

How can a business user maximize connectivity, device compatibility, and performance when deploying a Pepwave MAX BR1 Pro 5G on T-Mobile or Verizon, and what are the key considerations for SIM activation, antenna setup, and advanced services?

A business user seeking to deploy the Pepwave MAX BR1 Pro 5G on T-Mobile or Verizon should first ensure device compatibility and proper SIM activation. On T-Mobile, BYOD is not permitted for Home Internet but is allowed for Business Internet if the user provides the device IMEI and Employer ID Number to a T-Mobile business specialist, who will issue a new SIM. The device also works with T-Mobile business hotspot/data/router plans if certified. On Verizon, the BR1 Pro 5G is compatible with both pre-paid and post-paid plans and can use post-paid hotspot SIMs. For optimal performance, users should install recommended external antennas like the Mobility 42G or Pointing 7-in-1, as outside antennas significantly outperform internal ones. The device supports advanced features such as carrier aggregation, dual-band Wi-Fi 6, MIMO, and military-grade encryption, ensuring high speeds and secure connections. Additionally, activating or renewing the Prime Care subscription provides access to SpeedFusion services (hot failover, bonding, WAN smoothing), remote management via InControl II, and software updates—vital for maintaining unbreakable connectivity, especially for critical applications like video conferencing. Always consult carrier certification lists and coordinate with carrier support before deploying.

If a user wants to add a second wired WAN connection to their Pepwave BR1 series device, what are the recommended device options or configurations, and what are the limitations regarding WAN/LAN port conversion across different BR1 models?

A user cannot add a second wired WAN to the BR1 by converting a LAN port to WAN; this is not supported on the BR1, and specifically the BR1 Pro does not support converting WAN to LAN either. For those who need a second wired WAN, the Max HD2 is recommended instead of the BR1. The BR1 supports load balancing for multiple WAN links starting from firmware version 7.0.0, but this does not mean additional wired WAN ports can be added via LAN port conversion. On other models, such as the BR1 Slim, it is possible to configure a WAN port as a LAN port (not the other way around), but InControl2 management must be disabled to prevent settings from being overwritten. Power supply requirements should also be considered during configuration changes.

A customer upgrades their ISP plan to 400 Mbps and connects their Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 router (latest firmware) between their modem (e.g., ARRIS SB6141) and their devices. Despite confirming that the modem and router port speeds are set to 1 Gbps, speed tests through the router never exceed 110 Mbps, while direct modem connection yields 350+ Mbps. What are all the technical reasons for this observed speed limitation, and what should the technician recommend if the customer wants to utilize the full 400 Mbps speed?

The primary technical reason the customer is unable to achieve more than 110 Mbps through the Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3, despite having a 400 Mbps ISP plan and 1 Gbps link speeds between modem and router, is the router's maximum rated throughput of 120 Mbps. This is a hard specification limit for the device, and actual real-world speeds are often slightly lower due to processing overhead, Wi-Fi conditions, and network load. Attempts to adjust port speeds or use different settings will not overcome this limit. If the customer wishes to take full advantage of their 400 Mbps internet connection, they must upgrade to a Pepwave or Peplink router model with higher WAN throughput, such as the Balance One Core (rated up to 600 Mbps) or the Balance 20X (rated up to 900 Mbps).

List all the reliable methods to locate the IMEI number for Pepwave Max BR1 Mini LTE-series devices, including both LTEA and LTE-US-T models, and specify any differences in procedures or physical locations between the models.

For Pepwave Max BR1 Mini LTE-series devices, including both LTEA and LTE-US-T models, the IMEI number can reliably be found using several methods. For both models, you can access the IMEI digitally through the web admin interface or GUI by navigating to the cellular details or WAN connection status details. Specifically, for the LTEA model, the IMEI is found in InControl2 under the cellular section details, as well as via the web admin interface. For the LTE-US-T model, the IMEI is printed physically on a sticker on the bottom of the unit (labeled 'IMEA:'), and also on a white sticker inside the original packaging box. Both models also allow IMEI lookup digitally from the device's interface, typically under Dashboard > WAN Connection Status > Details or in the Cellular Details tab. Firmware updates may be necessary to ensure the IMEI displays correctly in the dashboard. Differences between models include the specific physical locations: the LTEA model's documentation does not mention a physical sticker, but the LTE-US-T model's IMEI is on both the unit and the box.

How does the Pepwave Max Transit Pro E differ from the Max Transit Pro in terms of modem configuration, cellular band compatibility, Wi-Fi support, Ethernet and power options, and which user scenarios would benefit from each model?

The Pepwave Max Transit Pro E features two independent Category 12 modems, each supporting up to 600 Mbps download, with four SIM slots and dual Wi-Fi antennas supporting Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac). It offers four gigabit Ethernet ports (one assignable as WAN, three as LAN), Power over Ethernet (PoE) support on port one (requires 56V), and uses a four-pin Molex connector for power. The Pro E does not support T-Mobile's band 71 and is positioned as an interim product with more Ethernet ports and local area networking capabilities, suitable for applications like RVs or those needing PoE and expanded wired networking.

The Max Transit Pro, in contrast, has dual modems as well, but with one Category 7 (supporting T-Mobile's band 71 and AT&T's band 14) and one Category 12 modem (supporting additional bands like 29/30 for AT&T). It supports Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) for improved speed and efficiency in high-density environments, has fewer Ethernet ports, but supports higher throughput (up to 1 Gbps router throughput). It also uses the four-pin Molex connector, has upgraded modems for broader carrier compatibility, and is better suited for users needing support for specific LTE bands, higher Wi-Fi performance, or future-proofing with advanced wireless features.

Users prioritizing wired connectivity, PoE, and robust local networking (e.g., for RV installations or where multiple wired devices are used) would benefit from the Pro E. Those needing advanced Wi-Fi, compatibility with T-Mobile's band 71, higher throughput, or more flexibility with wireless expansion should consider the Max Transit Pro.

What are the key steps and considerations for successfully activating and using a Pepwave MAX BR1 (including BR1 Pro 5G, MAX-BR1-LTE-V-T, and MAX-BR1 Mini variants) on Verizon’s network, especially if you encounter issues with SIM or IMEI recognition?

To activate and use a Pepwave MAX BR1 series device (such as BR1 Pro 5G, MAX-BR1-LTE-V-T, or MAX-BR1 Mini) on Verizon’s network, first obtain a Verizon-activated SIM card, ensuring it is the correct size for your model. During activation, provide Verizon with the device’s IMEI; however, the IMEI might not always be recognized in Verizon’s system. If this happens, possible workarounds include using the IMEI from a Verizon Jetpack or another supported device to activate the SIM, then moving the SIM to your Pepwave device. In some cases, using a 14-character IMEI (removing the last digit) or activating the SIM in a Jetpack before transferring it to the Pepwave can resolve BYOD SIM activation issues. Be prepared to supply additional details (like SIM card number, order number, and location) when contacting Verizon support, as their representatives may not be familiar with Pepwave devices. Once activated, the SIM should work in the Pepwave, which will typically appear in Verizon’s portal as a Pepwave Max BR1. Always confirm the SIM is active, properly inserted, and provisioned for data use to avoid recognition problems.

How can a technician deploy a Wi-Fi Mesh network with VLAN tagged SSIDs using Peplink or Pepwave devices, and what considerations are there for placement, firmware, AP management, and potential DHCP issues?

To deploy a Wi-Fi Mesh with VLAN tagged SSIDs using Peplink or Pepwave devices, the technician must use compatible hardware (routers/APs with 802.11ac or newer), ensure all devices run appropriate firmware (routers: 8.1.1+, APs: 3.6.2/3.7.3/3.8.1+), and power all mesh APs. The mesh is configured by creating and enabling a mesh profile on both routers and APs, making sure all APs share the same Mesh ID and key. Mesh networks operate at Layer 2, allowing VLAN tagged SSIDs to function similarly to wired networks. AP Controller can streamline provisioning and management. For optimal performance, mesh APs must be positioned between the wired AP and the coverage area to ensure strong links—direct wired APs always provide better performance due to radio sharing and capacity limits. A potential issue is that DHCP may not function as expected for tagged VLANs in certain mesh setups, so this should be tested during deployment.

How do hardware revision, firmware version, and real-world factors affect the maximum achievable throughput on the Peplink Balance 20, and what troubleshooting steps should a technician take to accurately assess and mitigate performance bottlenecks when using this model with high-speed internet connections?

The maximum throughput of the Peplink Balance 20 depends on its hardware revision and the firmware version in use. Older hardware revisions may be limited to 20Mbps or 100Mbps, while the current model can reach up to 150Mbps when running the latest firmware. Real-world throughput is often lower than the advertised specification due to factors such as high CPU usage during large downloads, Bufferbloat, and the router's inability to handle high WAN speeds (e.g., 500Mbps or 1Gbps). When actual WAN speeds exceed the router's rated throughput, users may experience unresponsiveness, high CPU load, or a significant drop in download speeds. To troubleshoot, technicians should first verify the hardware revision and firmware version of the Balance 20. Throughput should be tested by directly connecting a PC to the WAN, bypassing switches, to rule out external bottlenecks. Adjusting settings such as upload bandwidth limits and enabling traffic prioritization features may help, but ultimately, upgrading to a higher-capacity device (e.g., Balance 305 or Balance 20X) may be necessary to fully leverage high-speed ISP connections.

What are the complete requirements and common issues for configuring a Peplink router to manage a Starlink dish via the management IP 192.168.100.1, including firmware, IP addressing, WAN settings, outbound policies, and known device access limitations?

To manage a Starlink dish through a Peplink router, you must use special firmware version 8.1.1s118, which enables access to the dish at the management IP 192.168.100.1. The Peplink router's WAN ports should be set to DHCP/NAT mode, and automatic DNS is recommended. The WAN connection method must be DHCP, and you need to assign a management IP address within 192.168.100.2 to 192.168.100.254, saving and applying the changes. For LAN clients to access the dish management app, an outbound policy should be created: source 'Any', destination '192.168.100.1', using the Enforced algorithm to direct traffic to the Starlink WAN. Some Peplink models, such as Balance One, do not support this setup. Access to 192.168.100.1 may be limited, often only possible during the Starlink dish's initial boot, and pinging the address may not work at other times. Web browser compatibility can also affect management access, with some success in Microsoft Edge versus Chrome or Brave. Firmware updates are more reliable when performed over a wired (Ethernet) connection. The Starlink device may restrict admin access to clients within its local subnet, which can further complicate management connectivity.

If a technician switches a Pepwave Max BR1 Mini from a public static IP SIM to a private IP SIM and finds that port forwarding to internal devices fails, what are the underlying reasons and what secure alternatives are recommended for remote access to IP cameras?

Port forwarding requires the BR1 Mini's WAN IP to be public. When switching from a public static IP SIM to a private IP SIM, the WAN IP becomes inaccessible from the internet, causing port forwarding to fail even if configured correctly. This issue occurs because private IPs are not routed on the public internet and thus cannot receive inbound connections.

A more secure and effective alternative for remote access to IP cameras is to use PepVPN with a cloud-hosted FusionHub, which creates a secure routed network between the head office and remote BR1s. This approach eliminates the need for public static IPs and port forwarding, providing better security and reliability. SpeedFusion and L2TP tunnels are also recommended for secure remote access, and it is generally advised to avoid exposing ports directly to the internet to minimize security risks.

How does InControl2 (IC2) password management impact local admin access to Pepwave MAX-BR1-LTE-E and MAX-BR1-ENT-LTEA devices, and what settings or behaviors should technicians be aware of to prevent local login issues?

InControl2 (IC2) provides several options for managing the admin password on Pepwave MAX-BR1-LTE-E and MAX-BR1-ENT-LTEA devices, including device-managed, random password assignment per device, and shared password for all devices. If IC2 is set to manage passwords, it will overwrite any local admin password changes on the next heartbeat (usually within two minutes), potentially causing local access attempts to fail. For example, setting the password locally may work until the next IC2 sync, after which 'invalid username or password' errors will occur. To regain access, the password must be reset through IC2. Technicians should be aware that changing the 'Device Web Admin Management' setting from 'Device Managed' to 'Assign a Random Password' or 'Assign a Shared Password' will cause IC2 to control the password, and any local changes will be lost. To prevent confusion and access issues, it is recommended to restrict local password changes when IC2 is active and to manage all password changes through IC2 while it is enabled.

How should a technician systematically troubleshoot a Pepwave Max BR1 Mini that is stuck at 'Obtaining IP Address' with an AT&T SIM, taking into account both configuration and provisioning issues, and what are the limitations if the device cannot connect for a firmware update?

To systematically troubleshoot a Pepwave Max BR1 Mini stuck at 'Obtaining IP Address' with an AT&T SIM, the technician should first verify the SIM card is a data-only card provisioned for hotspots, as some cards work in phones but not routers. Next, check APN settings: set APN to 'phone' with username and password blank, and set IP type to IPv4 if possible. The technician should also try different network modes (Auto, AT&T only, Generic), and toggle between LTE/3G Auto or 3G only. Rebooting, performing a hard or factory reset, and updating the PRL or performing a cellular reset may also help. Firmware should be updated to the latest version, as outdated firmware can cause compatibility issues, but if no internet connection is available, this step may not be possible. If the issue persists, test the SIM in another device to rule out SIM issues, but be aware that some SIMs are carrier-locked or restricted. If all troubleshooting fails and the firmware cannot be updated due to lack of connectivity, the technician should open a support ticket and consider connecting an alternative WAN for remote assistance. Limitations in this scenario include the inability to update firmware or use a different SIM if the carrier restricts movement, which may prevent full resolution without external support or connectivity.

If an enterprise environment requires 10G fiber uplinks and Power over Ethernet (PoE) on all ports in a rugged switch deployment, which Peplink SD Switch models and SFP+ modules should be considered for maximum compatibility and fewest known issues? How do known hardware limitations and compatibility influence the choice?

For an enterprise deployment requiring 10G fiber uplinks and PoE on all ports in a rugged switch environment, the Peplink SD Switch 24-Port Rugged and higher (such as the 48-Port) models should be prioritized. The SD Switch 24-Port Rugged is specifically recommended because it has improved grounding (more separated GND_POE), which addresses known hardware incompatibilities with Intel Ethernet NICs equipped with ASUS LANGuard—a problem present in the 8-Port and 16-Port Rugged models. For SFP+ module selection, thoroughly tested and compatible models include Avago's AFBR-700SDZ and AFBR-703SDZ-IN2, Finisar's FTLX8571D3BCL and FTLX8571D3QCV-IT, and Intel's AFBR-703SDZ-IN2, with FS SFP 10G-T adapters also validated for use in 24/48-port SD switches. Rugged switch models should be chosen that support PoE on all ports as recommended for such environments. The 8-Port and 16-Port Rugged models are cost-effective and rugged but have PoE hardware compatibility issues with certain Intel NICs, making the 24-Port Rugged a more reliable option for critical deployments requiring broad compatibility and performance.

How does the Balance 20X router enable multi-WAN connectivity and redundancy, and what are the various options for WAN expansion, including the roles of firmware updates, hardware ports, and licensing?

The Balance 20X router enables multi-WAN connectivity by providing one Ethernet WAN port, one embedded LTE modem, and a USB port that can function as an additional WAN interface for cellular or Ethernet connections. It also features a Flex module slot for further WAN expansion, which can accommodate modules for DSL, 5G, or more cellular options. Firmware updates, notably version 8.3, have introduced virtual WAN capability, allowing LAN ports to be converted into additional wired WAN ports, and Wi-Fi as WAN for connecting to external Wi-Fi networks. With these hardware and software enhancements, the Balance 20X can support up to six simultaneous internet connections from a mix of wired, cellular, USB, and Wi-Fi sources. Some advanced features and WAN expansion capabilities require a PrimeCare subscription and/or specific license unlocks, which also provide access to services like InControl, SpeedFusion upgrades, and FusionHub licenses. For redundancy, the device can combine multiple WAN sources (e.g., cable, LTE, and USB cellular) for failover, load balancing, and SpeedFusion bonding, ensuring continuous connectivity for small businesses or home offices. Users are advised not to use the USB port for their primary WAN connection, as its speed is typically limited relative to other WAN interfaces.

How do the Pepwave Max BR1 Pro 5G and Max BR2 Pro 5G differ in modem chipset, SIM support, external connectivity options, and future-proofing for AT&T’s 5G network?

The Pepwave Max BR1 Pro 5G uses the Qualcomm X55 modem, while the Max BR2 Pro 5G utilizes the newer Qualcomm X62 modem, which supports more 5G bands, including AT&T's Andromeda Spectrum, and is compatible with 5G Phase 2, making the BR2 Pro 5G more future-proof for AT&T’s upcoming mid-band 5G deployments. The BR1 Pro 5G features a single modem and supports two nano SIM cards (with one active at a time), whereas the BR2 Pro 5G is a dual-modem device with four nano SIM slots and eSIM support, allowing for carrier flexibility and redundancy. For external connectivity, the BR1 Pro 5G offers three Ethernet ports (one 2.5 Gbps LAN), four cellular antenna ports, one GPS port, and Wi-Fi 6, but lacks USB tethering. The BR2 Pro 5G includes multiple 2.5 Gbps WAN ports, four Ethernet LAN ports, Wi-Fi 6, a USB port for tethering, and additional antenna ports. This makes the BR2 Pro 5G suitable for more demanding, multi-carrier, and mobile environments, and ensures it is better equipped for future AT&T 5G expansions.

How does the use of an external DHCP server affect VPN client connectivity (specifically L2TP/PPTP) to LAN resources on Peplink Balance routers, and what configuration steps can resolve the routing or access issues observed?

When using L2TP or PPTP VPN on Peplink Balance routers with an external (third-party) DHCP server, VPN clients often receive IP addresses within the LAN subnet but experience connectivity issues, such as being unable to access LAN resources beyond the router itself. This problem is reproducible on both Balance 710 and 380 models. The connectivity issue arises because routing between the VPN-assigned addresses and LAN devices can fail when VPN clients are given IPs from the same LAN subnet by the external DHCP server. Enabling the Peplink's own DHCP server for VPN clients, or configuring it to assign addresses from a different subnet, can resolve these issues by ensuring proper routing between VPN clients and LAN resources. With Peplink's DHCP enabled, PPTP and L2TP VPN clients can access LAN devices as expected. However, it is possible to connect to the internal PPTP server with DHCP disabled if a Microsoft-based DHCP server is on the native LAN, but this may not resolve all routing issues for all LAN resources. Therefore, enabling the Peplink DHCP server for VPN clients and assigning them a separate subnet is the recommended solution for reliable access.

How does Peplink SpeedFusion technology differ from traditional VPN and bonding solutions in terms of requirements, supported connection types, failover, and security, and what are key deployment options for different user types?

Peplink SpeedFusion technology differs from traditional VPN and bonding solutions in several ways. Unlike IPsec VPN or LACP bonding, which often require identical circuits or are sensitive to latency and packet loss, SpeedFusion can bond any mix of internet connections (e.g., fiber, DSL, 4G, 5G, satellite, Wi-Fi) from different providers. It aggregates bandwidth at the packet level, providing combined throughput and seamless failover without session drops. SpeedFusion requires compatible Peplink devices or FusionHub endpoints at both ends to bond connections, supporting topologies such as point-to-point, hub-and-spoke, or full mesh. Security is enhanced through unique encryption keys for each WAN, offering better protection than traditional VPNs. For deployment, enterprise users typically use hardware appliances at headquarters, while home users can leverage Peplink's hosted services or run FusionHub as a virtual endpoint for cost-effectiveness. Centralized management is available through the InControl platform, simplifying large-scale deployments.

How can outbound policy rules on the Peplink Balance 20/30 series be used to ensure that specific types of traffic, such as FTP, consistently use a designated WAN connection, and what configuration steps are required to avoid round-robin distribution between multiple WANs?

On the Peplink Balance 20/30 series, outbound policy rules can be configured to direct specific types of traffic, like FTP, through a designated WAN connection. To achieve this, you should navigate to the Network settings and set the Outbound Policy to 'Managed by Custom Rules'. Retain the default rules ('HTTPS Persistence' and 'Default'), then add new rules targeting the desired LAN clients or traffic types (e.g., FTP) and assign them to use a specific WAN. This ensures that both outgoing and return traffic for the specified sessions use the same WAN, maintaining session integrity and preventing round-robin distribution. After creating these rules, remember to click 'Save' and then 'Apply Changes' to activate them. This process ensures that traffic, such as FTP sessions, is consistently routed through the chosen WAN link.

How does the Peplink BR2 Pro 5G router enable secure, high-bandwidth, and reliable internet connectivity for remote and mobile environments, and what specific hardware and software features distinguish it from the BR1 Pro 5G and Max BR2 models?

The Peplink BR2 Pro 5G router is engineered to provide secure, high-bandwidth, and reliable internet connectivity for remote and mobile environments by combining several advanced hardware and software features. It supports dual 5G modems, allowing the use of two separate mobile networks simultaneously for redundancy and failover. The router can bond up to seven different WAN connections—including Ethernet, Wi-Fi WAN, USB, and Starlink—using SpeedFusion technology for aggregated bandwidth and seamless failover, enhancing reliability for applications like live video streaming, remote testing, and vehicle deployments.

Security is achieved by supporting VPN bonding back to a FusionHub appliance at a central location (such as a school district), ensuring all remote internet traffic is filtered and protected by central firewalls and filtering systems. The BR2 Pro 5G features four nano SIM slots to facilitate flexible carrier selection, supports eSIM functionality (with firmware 8.4), and operates on rugged DC power suitable for vehicles.

Compared to the BR1 Pro 5G, the BR2 Pro 5G offers dual modems (versus a single modem in the BR1 Pro 5G), more WAN/LAN ports, and greater throughput, making it better suited for environments where connectivity reliability and redundancy are critical. The Max BR2, while also supporting dual modems and multiple WANs, typically uses the older X55 modem, which lacks support for future 5G bands like AT&T’s Andromeda Spectrum and may not be as future-proof as the BR2 Pro 5G with the newer X62 modem.

The BR2 Pro 5G is distinguished by its use of the Qualcomm X62 modem, which supports multi-band 5G carrier aggregation, enabling better speed and range, especially in fringe areas or with future networks. It includes Wi-Fi 6, supports PoE, external SIM injectors, GPS, and advanced remote management via InControl. These features collectively make the BR2 Pro 5G a comprehensive solution for secure, high-performance, and resilient mobile or remote deployments.

How should a technician differentiate between router hardware limitations and configuration issues when troubleshooting lower-than-expected throughput on Peplink Balance series routers (such as Balance One and Balance 380), especially when multiple WAN connections or high-speed services are in use?

To differentiate between hardware limitations and configuration issues on Peplink Balance series routers, a technician should first check the router's advertised throughput and compare it to observed speeds. For example, the Balance One is rated for 600Mbps Stateful Firewall Throughput but often achieves only around 300Mbps, with CPU usage reaching 100% during speed tests—indicating a hardware bottleneck. In contrast, directly connecting the same modem to another router (like pfSense or Firewalla Gold Plus) often results in much higher speeds, confirming the Peplink's hardware as the limiting factor. When troubleshooting, the technician should also test with different firmware versions, disable features like Mitigate Bufferbloat, and adjust MTU settings, but if performance does not improve and CPU remains maxed out, this further points to hardware limits. For the Balance 380 HW5, its 200Mbps maximum router throughput is lower than the combined WAN speeds, causing saturation. Upgrading to a higher-capacity model (e.g., Balance 380 HW6 or Balance 580) is recommended when throughput needs exceed device ratings. Configuration changes, such as using the correct browser (Edge), setting speedtest.net to Single Connection, and monitoring test device CPU load, can also help eliminate external factors and confirm if the issue is with the router itself.

How should a technician select and install external antennas for a Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini to improve cellular signal in both rural and urban environments, taking into account cable loss, antenna type, MIMO support, and supplier recommendations?

To enhance cellular signal on a Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini, technicians should first determine whether the deployment is in a rural or urban environment. In rural areas, directional antennas (such as Yagi or XPOL-2 MIMO) are recommended if there is a clear line of sight to distant towers, while omnidirectional antennas are preferable if multiple towers are present or obstacles like trees block the view. In urban areas with multiple providers, high-quality omnidirectional MIMO antennas are favored for their ability to capture signals from various directions. Regardless of environment, all antenna installations should support MIMO technology and use high-quality, low-loss 50 Ohm coaxial cable with cable runs kept as short as possible to minimize signal degradation. The router should be placed as close to the antenna as practical, potentially in a weatherproof enclosure, to further reduce cable loss. Trusted antenna brands include Poynting, Wilson, Taoglas, RFI Wireless, and Telco Antennas. For precise product selection, technicians should consult the Antenna Selection Guide and seek support from local Authorized Peplink Partners, who can also assist with sourcing certified antennas and installation best practices.

What are the differences between IP passthrough and IP forwarding on the Peplink Balance 310X, and what configuration options or workarounds are available if you need to provide a public IP to a downstream device on a WAN or cellular interface?

The Peplink Balance 310X does not support IP passthrough on either WAN or cellular interfaces in firmware version 8.1.3 build 5162. However, it does support IP forwarding on the WAN side, which can be enabled through the WAN connection settings. If IP passthrough is required due to limited public IPs (such as when using a /30 subnet in Drop-in WAN mode), it is recommended to enable the Share Drop-In IP feature as a workaround. Non Drop-in WANs can handle /30 subnets without issue. For detailed guidance on enabling IP forwarding, users should consult the question mark icon in the WAN settings.

How can a technician ensure that outbound traffic from a Pepwave device uses the same external IP address as inbound traffic, particularly when using additional public IP addresses, and what configuration steps are required?

To ensure outbound traffic uses the same external IP address as inbound traffic on a Pepwave device—especially when using additional public IP addresses—a technician should use NAT Mapping (also called outbound mapping) rather than just outbound policy. The NAT Mapping interface allows selection of specific external IPs for both inbound and outbound connections, enabling one-to-one NAT mappings. The technician should go to the network settings, access Outbound Mappings, and create a new mapping specifying the local IP and the intended public IP. If using an additional public IP address (not the WAN’s primary IP), a 1-to-1 NAT map must be created for that IP, and an outbound policy rule may also be required to ensure traffic goes through the correct WAN link and uses the chosen external IP.

What troubleshooting steps and considerations should a technician follow when the SOHO MK3 fails to update from firmware 8.0.2 to 8.1.0, including any relevant differences in behavior compared to other models and the impact of device management tools like InControl?

When the SOHO MK3 fails to update from firmware 8.0.2 to 8.1.0 and the old firmware version still displays after rebooting, several troubleshooting steps and factors should be considered. First, try downloading the current configuration, performing a factory reset, and then attempting the firmware upgrade again; after a successful upgrade, restore the configuration. The issue is specific to the SOHO MK3 model and is not reported with the B30 model, indicating model-specific firmware handling. In some cases, a special firmware version may be required for the SOHO MK3 to upgrade successfully. Devices managed through InControl are more likely to experience update failures than those not managed by InControl. Additionally, failed upgrades may result in a 'not bootable' error or persistent display of the old version. After an apparent upgrade, some users have also reported device crashes during upload speed tests exceeding 55 Mbps, even if the upgrade seems successful, so verify device stability after upgrading.

A technician is attempting to upgrade the firmware of a Pepwave SOHO MK3 from version 8.0.2 to 8.1.0 but finds that after rebooting, the router still displays 8.0.2, and sometimes crashes during upload speed tests exceeding 55 Mbps. What troubleshooting steps and solutions should the technician consider, and what factors may cause these issues?

The SOHO MK3 often fails to reflect a firmware upgrade from 8.0.2 to 8.1.0 after rebooting, even though the upgrade process appears to complete. This issue is specific to the SOHO MK3 and does not occur with devices like the B30. Users have reported that when the firmware upgrade appears successful, the device still shows 8.0.2 after reboot, and running upload speed tests can cause the router to crash, especially when sustained upload speeds exceed 55 Mbps. The crash and the upgrade not reflecting may be related to configuration issues, management through InControl, or the need for special firmware. Troubleshooting steps include downloading the current configuration, restoring the router to factory defaults, upgrading the firmware again, and then restoring the configuration if the upgrade is successful. If managed by InControl, disconnecting from InControl or using a special firmware version may resolve the issue. A 'not bootable' error during upgrade attempts may indicate a compatibility or installation problem, and checking for newer or special firmware builds is advised.
