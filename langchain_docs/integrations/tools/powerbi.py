# # PowerBI Toolkit
# 
# This notebook showcases an agent interacting with a `Power BI Dataset`. The agent is answering more general questions about a dataset, as well as recover from errors.
# 
# Note that, as this agent is in active development, all answers might not be correct. It runs against the [executequery endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/datasets/execute-queries), which does not allow deletes.
# 
# ### Notes:
# - It relies on authentication with the azure.identity package, which can be installed with `pip install azure-identity`. Alternatively you can create the powerbi dataset with a token as a string without supplying the credentials.
# - You can also supply a username to impersonate for use with datasets that have RLS enabled. 
# - The toolkit uses a LLM to create the query from the question, the agent uses the LLM for the overall execution.
# - Testing was done mostly with a `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct` model, codex models did not seem to perform ver well.
