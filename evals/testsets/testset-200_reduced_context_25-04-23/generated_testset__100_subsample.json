Additionally, policies can be restricted to apply only to the streaming ports to manage bandwidth effectively and prevent timeout issues due to ISP stream limits.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Surf Soho Mk3 router has a 'WiFi as WAN' feature, but users have reported issues with the WiFi disappearing intermittently after initial setup. After the first day of operation, the WiFi connection becomes unavailable, requiring a hard reset and reconfiguration to restore functionality. Additionally, the router's CPU can spike to 100% workload, causing all connected devices to lose their connection, particularly when applying changes in settings. Upgrading to the latest firmware has been attempted without resolving the issue.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe user is experiencing issues with the Surf Soho Mk3 router, specifically with the WiFi as WAN feature, where the WiFi SSID disappears intermittently despite the router showing normal operational status. The user has performed hard resets and firmware upgrades but continues to face connectivity issues. The CPU workload occasionally spikes to 100%, causing all connected devices to lose their connection. A suggestion is made to revert to firmware version 7.1.2 to see if it resolves the issues, as firmware 8 may have introduced problems. Additionally, it is advised to avoid using WPA3 due to its newness and potential instability.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Surf Soho MK3 is experiencing issues with a dedicated hotspot/MiFi device connected via a 2.4GHz WiFi WAN connection, hanging up multiple times. Troubleshooting steps taken include removing other 2.4GHz WiFi profiles, disabling the WiFi AP, and adjusting settings such as MTU and switching from DHCP to a static IP. The device is running the latest firmware version 8.1.0 build 4941, and when it hangs, InControl2 reports it as offline, although the primary WAN connection remains operational.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe Surf SOHO MK3 is experiencing frequent lockups while connected to a cellular hotspot using WiFi as WAN, resulting in the disappearance of the WiFi network and inability to access the unit or reset it via the physical button. The issue persists even after updating the firmware from version 6.3.3 to 7.0.2 and performing a factory reset. During the lockup state, the device does not assign IP addresses via DHCP when connected via Ethernet, requiring a power cycle to restore functionality.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe Surf SOHO MK3 is experiencing issues where the WiFi disappears, requiring power cycling to restore functionality. The device was initially on firmware version 6.3.3 and was updated to 7.0.2, but the problem persisted. During the locked state, the unit cannot be accessed or reset via the physical button. Additionally, a user reported similar issues with their MK3, where the 2nd and 3rd SSIDs stop broadcasting while the 1st SSID remains functional. A workaround involved scheduling the radio to turn off and on, but the scheduling feature has limitations with a 30-minute granularity. The network setup includes multiple SSIDs on different VLANs and various WAN connections, including Ethernet and USB to hotspots.\n\n## Document_9\n\nTo diagnose the issue of a Surf SOHO router locking up, it is recommended to log into the router from the LAN to check the WAN status and to use InControl2 for logging the router's uptime and downtime. The problem may stem from the handshake between the router and the cable modem, which has been a known issue with some cable modems. Checking the cable modem's log can help determine if the modem is going offline, indicating a communication failure rather than a router failure. Setting the WAN definition to always use full duplex and gigabit speeds may help avoid handshake issues.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Surf SOHO router has experienced lockups approximately every 60-90 days since its purchase in December 2017, with the last occurrence noted on July 22. The router is running hardware revision 1 and firmware version 7.1.0 build 1284, while it is connected to an Arris SB6190 cable modem with a stable connection. The user has multiple WiFi networks, including VLANs, and has not enabled remote access or port forwarding. When the router locks up, the user cannot access it via WiFi, and the Arlo cameras connected to the LAN port go offline, indicating a loss of WAN connectivity. Power cycling the router temporarily resolves the issue. To diagnose the problem further, obtaining a diagnostic report from the router is recommended.\n\n## Document_11\n\nInControl2's usage column may show blank data if it is not receiving updates from the device. For real-time usage information, users should refer to the device's Bandwidth and Usage Reports, which provide detailed insights into data consumption.\n\n## Document_12\n\nWhen experiencing issues with the Surf Soho Mk3 router where the WiFi SSID disappears, it is important to check the Client List via an Ethernet connection and review the AP log for any unusual events. The Dashboard should indicate whether the SSIDs are active. High CPU usage, particularly spikes to 100% when applying changes, is normal and may cause temporary disconnections. It is recommended to use the latest firmware version, 8.1.1 Release Candidate 3, for optimal performance.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Surf SOHO MK3 is experiencing frequent lockups where the WiFi disappears and the device becomes unresponsive, requiring power cycling to restore functionality.

    "query": "How should a technician approach diagnosing and mitigating the recurring issue of WiFi disappearance and device lockups on the Surf SOHO MK3 when using WiFi as WAN, particularly when standard troubleshooting steps (firmware upgrades, factory resets) have not resolved the issue?",
    "answer": "To diagnose and mitigate the recurring WiFi disappearance and lockup issue on the Surf SOHO MK3 with WiFi as WAN, the technician should first verify whether the problem occurs across different firmware versions, including both recent releases (such as 8.1.0 or 8.1.1 RC3) and earlier stable versions like 7.1.2, as some users reported persistent issues and others suggested downgrading. Examine the AP and event logs for anomalies when the device is accessible, but note that some users have reported blank logs during failures. When the device locks up, check if it is unresponsive via both Ethernet and WiFi and whether the reset button is functional; if not, this suggests a deeper system-level failure rather than just a WiFi subsystem issue. During lockups, observe device LEDs for abnormal patterns (e.g., solid lights without activity). Consider running with a static IP instead of DHCP for WAN, as changing this has been suggested for troubleshooting. If possible, schedule WiFi radio resets (with awareness of the scheduler's 30-minute granularity limitation) as a temporary workaround. Finally, check for hardware revision information and environmental factors, as some users have experienced lockups over long periods (e.g., every 60–90 days) even on different hardware revisions and with various WAN types. Collect and analyze a diagnostic report if the device can be accessed after a reboot, and use InControl2 for uptime monitoring, but keep in mind that real-time usage data may only be available from onboard reports if the device is unresponsive to InControl2.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nIn bonding multiple internet connections using Peplink's SpeedFusion technology, WAN latency is crucial for optimal performance. High latency connections can significantly reduce overall throughput. For example, combining low-latency cable connections with high-latency DSL connections can lead to diminished speed improvements. It is recommended to monitor WAN circuits for speed, drop rate, and latency through the router's dashboard. If latency varies significantly (more than 75-100ms) among connections, it can further decrease bonding capacity. For applications like VoIP, maintaining latency below 150ms is ideal.\n\n## Document_2\n\nWhen using a Peplink Balance 20 with multiple WAN connections, normal internet traffic will load balance between the WANs, which can lead to inconsistent performance during activities like streaming and browsing. Speedtest.net may show higher results because it tests the combined bandwidth of both connections. To configure the device for better performance, users can access the Peplink console at 192.168.1.1 and set outbound policy rules to optimize traffic based on their specific needs.\n\n## Document_3\n\nTo troubleshoot performance issues with a PEPLINK BALANCE 20 when connected to a 50 Mbps fiber optic internet connection and a 10 Mbps phone internet service, it is suggested to reset the router to default settings using the reset button. Despite speed tests showing higher results, the user experiences slower and unstable performance when streaming media and surfing the web, indicating potential issues with the configuration or ISP service.\n\n## Document_4\n\nTo troubleshoot low download speeds on a Peplink Balance 20 when connected through an ADSL modem/router, it is suggested to utilize the DSL optimization feature. It is acknowledged that there will be some loss of throughput due to the additional hop through the router, but the extent of the loss should not be as significant as reported. Additionally, using Wi-Fi can further reduce speeds due to the encryption algorithm involved.\n\n## Document_5\n\nTo troubleshoot low download speeds on a Peplink Balance 20 when connected to an ADSL modem/router, check for any bandwidth allocations or reservations set up for user groups that may limit throughput. Ensure that the upload and download speeds are configured correctly in the WAN settings, and consider doubling the capabilities to see if it improves performance. Additionally, be aware that a managed switch in the connection path may introduce latency, and proprietary features of the modem may affect speed based on device compatibility.\n\n## Document_6\n\nTo address slow download speeds on a Peplink Balance 20 Router when connected to a Motorola NVG510 modem, it is recommended to check and fix the port speed and duplex mode settings for the WAN interface of both the Peplink router and the modem. This adjustment may help improve the download speed performance.\n\n## Document_7\n\nTo address slow download speeds when using a Peplink Balance 20 Router with an ATT DSL service, it is recommended to try setting the connection to 100M Full Duplex (FD) instead of AUTO, as some modems may be sensitive to this setting. Additionally, checking the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) setting is important; for DSL connections, it should typically be set to 1492 to optimize performance.\n\n## Document_8\n\nWhen experiencing slow download speeds with a Peplink Balance 20 Router, it is important to check the configuration settings, including WAN interface settings which should be set to Auto/Auto for proper connection to the carrier router. In cases where bandwidth degradation occurs only when the Peplink is in use, it may be beneficial to investigate the Peplink interfaces for errors or performance issues, as well as to ensure that outbound policies and bandwidth limits are not inadvertently affecting performance. Additionally, using Drop-in mode may impact the routing and performance, so reviewing this setup could also be necessary.\n\n## Document_9\n\nWhen configuring a Peplink Balance 20 for load balancing with two ADSL connections and a mobile 4G backup, it is important to note that defining WAN download/upload speeds can limit the available upload speed for the WAN to 256kb. This means that performing a speed test using WAN1 will yield only 256kb upload speeds. For optimal performance and prioritization of traffic, further assistance through a support ticket may be necessary.\n\n## Document_10\n\nIn a setup involving a Peplink Balance 50 connected to four internet connections (two 175 Mbps fiber and two 80 Mbps cable), low throughput issues can arise even when sufficient bandwidth is available. Factors such as layer 2 switching limitations and configuration settings may affect the overall performance. In a related scenario with a Peplink Balance 20 connected to a CISCO box, low bandwidth measurements were reported despite a high-speed connection from the ISP. The device's performance can be influenced by firmware versions and network configurations, which may need to be optimized to improve download and upload speeds.\n\n## Document_11\n\nWhen bonding multiple internet connections using a Peplink Balance380 and Pepwave Max700, slower connections can significantly reduce the overall bonded speed, particularly when attempting to stream live video. To manage connections with varying latencies, one approach is to place high latency connections in a separate priority group for redundancy without bonding. However, this may not be practical in mobile scenarios where connection quality can change based on location.\n\n## Document_12\n\nWhen bonding multiple internet connections using Peplink devices, slower connections can significantly reduce the overall upload speed of the bonded link. In a scenario where a Peplink Balance 380 is used with a Pepwave Max 700, the user experiences upload speeds below 1 Mbit/s when bonding five connections, despite some connections being faster individually. This issue is compounded by the variability of connection speeds in different locations, making it difficult to determine which connections to remove for optimal performance. Additionally, another user notes that in their experience with Peplink products, they do not observe bandwidth aggregation benefits when using multiple connections, suggesting that a single, faster link may perform better than multiple slower ones.\n\n## Document_13\n\nWhen bonding multiple internet connections using a Peplink Balance380 and Pepwave Max700, slower connections can significantly reduce the overall bonded upload speed, particularly when the connections have high latency and multiple hops. This can lead to inadequate performance for applications like live video streaming. It is important to monitor latency details to understand the impact on bonding performance.\n\n## Document_14\n\nWhen using a Peplink Balance380 and a Pepwave Max700 for bonding multiple internet connections, slower connections can significantly reduce the overall bonded upload speed, which can drop below 1 Mbit/s even when individual connections are faster. This poses challenges for applications like live video streaming. The issue arises because the bonding process does not allow for the removal of slower connections dynamically, which is problematic in mobile setups where connection quality can vary widely based on location.\n\n## Document_15\n\nTo configure a Peplink Balance 20 for load balancing and prioritization, use the default Outbound Policy settings with specific adjustments. Set the HTTPS_Persistence Rule to have a custom load distribution with equal weights for WAN1 and WAN2, while others are set to zero. For the Default Rule, use the Overflow algorithm with the order of WAN1, WAN2, and Mobile Internet. Prioritization of traffic can be managed through the QoS settings under Network > QoS > Application, allowing for specific prioritization of email, browsing, Soonr.com, and other traffic types.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo configure a Peplink Balance 20 for load balancing with two ADSL connections and a mobile 4G connection, the mobile connection should be set to 'Always On' for the Overflow rule to function correctly. This setup allows the mobile connection to activate when both ADSL lines fail or become saturated, ensuring continuous connectivity.\n\n## Document_17\n\nIn a setup involving a Peplink Balance 20 with two ADSL connections and a mobile 4G connection, it is possible to configure the mobile WAN to activate when both ADSL connections fail or when they are saturated. Additionally, prioritization of traffic can be set for different types of usage, such as email, browsing and downloading, and specific applications like Soonr.com, although further clarification on the network protocol used for downloads may be necessary for troubleshooting purposes.\n\n",

The BR1 Pro 5G is priced at $1,499, reflecting its advanced technology, and is positioned as a more future-proof option compared to the older Max Transit 5G model, which lacks Wi-Fi 6 and has lower performance capabilities. However, it does not support millimeter wave 5G and currently lacks a functional band locking feature in its firmware.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe video explains how to use the air probe feature in the AP firmware, allowing any access point (AP) to be switched to air monitor mode, which disables its access point functionality. Users can enable air monitor mode by editing the AP settings and saving the changes. Once in air monitor mode, the AP can perform Wi-Fi air monitoring and performance tests for different SSIDs, with customizable test schedules. Reports can be generated to display performance test results and air monitoring data, including network utilization, unique nodes, and channel activity for both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies. This feature provides insights similar to a remote spectrum analyzer, allowing users to analyze channel overlap and network performance.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe discussion highlights various aspects of internet connectivity, particularly focusing on the performance of Pepwave routers such as the BR1 Pro 5G and Transit Duo. It emphasizes the importance of having reliable internet solutions, especially in mobile scenarios, and contrasts the power consumption of Starlink systems with Pepwave devices, noting that Starlink can require significantly more power (up to 300 watts) compared to Pepwave routers which typically use around 15 watts. The conversation also touches on the limitations of millimeter wave 5G technology, stating that no current router supports it due to the sensitivity of the technology. Additionally, the availability and performance of nationwide 5G are discussed, indicating that it is becoming more widespread and capable of delivering substantial speeds.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe Pepwave Max BR1 Pro 5G is a redesigned modem featuring a category 20 5G modem and a 2.5 gigabit WAN port that can be assigned as a LAN port. It includes four cellular antennas and two Wi-Fi 6 antennas supporting both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies. The modem has a maximum throughput of 1 gigabit and supports speeds of up to 400 megabits for unencrypted SpeedFusion tunnels. It utilizes nano SIM cards and features an ignition sense port for vehicle applications. The modem also supports Wi-Fi WAN bonding and comes with a power adapter that uses a micro molex connector, moving away from the previous barrel connector design. Additionally, it includes GPS capabilities and wire management accessories to enhance installation.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Starlink Mini requires a power source that can extend up to 100 feet, with a recommended voltage of 48 volts for longer distances. There are PoE adapters in development that will allow the Mini to be powered via Ethernet, simplifying installation. The standard power cable provided is 50 feet long, with a 100-foot option available for purchase. The Mini can be powered using USB-C connections from compatible battery banks designed for laptops. For routers, the Peplink B1 and B1 5G are recommended to combine Starlink with cellular connections, providing redundancy and enhanced connectivity. The flat HP dish is less recommended for typical RV and cruiser use due to its high power consumption and cost, while the standard and Mini dishes are now fully supported for use in motion. DC conversion kits are available for the Gen 3 standard, which can save power by eliminating the need for an inverter, particularly in off-grid setups.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe video discusses the use of Starlink satellite systems, specifically the flat HP, standard, and mini models, for mobile internet connectivity on RVs and boats. The flat HP was previously the only certified option for use in motion, but now both the standard and mini models are fully supported and legal for mobile use. The DC conversion kits for the Gen 3 standard allow it to run off DC power, potentially saving energy by eliminating the need for an inverter, which can have significant parasitic loads. The mini model is noted for its lower power consumption compared to cellular routers, making it suitable for mobile applications. The mini can also be used on mobile priority plans, and there are updates regarding Starlink's plans to enhance their satellite technology and service offerings in the future. Both the standard and mini models are considered cost-effective compared to other satellite technologies in the marine market.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe Starlink mini dish can be connected to an external router, such as a Peplink router, but this configuration puts the dish into bypass mode, requiring a reset to switch back to Wi-Fi. Performance-wise, the mini dish can achieve download speeds of 50 to 100 Mbps, but it is less consistent compared to the Gen 3 dish, which can reach higher speeds due to its prioritization plan. The upload speeds from the mini dish are generally slower, especially when the dish is further from the Wi-Fi device. Power consumption for the mini dish is lower, averaging around 25 watts, compared to the Gen 3's 51 watts. The mini dish is priced at $599, making it more expensive than the Gen 3, which is currently on sale for $299. The mini dish is ideal for ultra-portability, but for typical RV use, the Gen 3 offers better performance and connectivity options.\n\n",

Users should define specific variables in the PowerShell script, such as resource group name, storage account, and VM size. After deployment, enabling IP forwarding on the FusionHub network interface is necessary for remote access, and a DNS name can be created for easier access to the FusionHub admin page. Additionally, resources for connecting Peplink or Pepwave devices to FusionHub and enabling SpeedFusion are available.\n\n## Document_12\n\nFusionHub is a virtual SpeedFusion appliance from Peplink that allows for establishing SpeedFusion connections between cloud servers and physical Peplink devices. It can run on various virtual machine software, including VMware, Citrix XenServer, and Oracle VirtualBox. FusionHub enables bandwidth bonding by combining the speed of multiple WAN links and provides session persistence for a highly available connection. It can be deployed in private, public, and hybrid clouds, integrating datacenters and cloud servers into existing SpeedFusion networks.\n\n## Document_13\n\nFusionHub is designed primarily as a SpeedFusion VPN concentrator and is not intended to replace a Peplink Balance router. While Peplink is continuously working on adding new features to FusionHub, the focus is on maintaining a low codebase and resource requirements for cost-effective operation on various hypervisor platforms. Users often deploy FusionHub alongside additional Layer 3 routers, such as PFsense, to enable IPSec connectivity. Additionally, PepVPN connections between FusionHub instances are possible, allowing for integration of cloud environments across different providers and geographical locations.\n\n## Document_14\n\nPeplink's FusionHub is a virtual appliance that functions as an alternative to hardware-based SpeedFusion routers and the SpeedFusion Cloud service, allowing users to connect without needing a public IP address, as this can be provided by the cloud service. The FusionHub Solo is a free option limited to one peer-to-peer connection, while paid licenses support multiple connections. Users must set up an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to configure the FusionHub, selecting an instance type such as the T3 medium for optimal performance. The setup involves navigating through AWS to subscribe to the FusionHub service, launching an EC2 instance, and configuring it with a unique local ID and license key. Firmware updates can be performed through the web admin interface or InControl2, and configuration of SpeedFusion can be done via the web admin or InControl2, but not simultaneously.\n\n## Document_15\n\nTo deploy FusionHub from AWS Marketplace, users should have basic knowledge of SpeedFusion/PepVPN, InControl 2, and AWS services such as EC2 and VPC. The FusionHub license model allows for one free SpeedFusion/PepVPN peer, with additional peers requiring a purchased license. Deployment involves selecting an EC2 instance type, configuring network settings, and associating a public IP for access. Post-installation tasks include disabling source/destination checks and enabling IP forwarding. Users can test connectivity using built-in tools like PING and the PepVPN Analyzer.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo deploy FusionHub from the AWS Marketplace, users need to have a basic understanding of SpeedFusion/PepVPN, InControl 2, and the AWS environment, including EC2 and VPC. The FusionHub license model allows one free peer connection, with additional peers requiring a purchased license. The deployment involves selecting an appropriate EC2 instance type, configuring network settings, and ensuring external connectivity by disabling source/destination checks and enabling IP forwarding. After installation, users can test connectivity using built-in tools like PING and the PepVPN Analyzer, and troubleshoot issues by checking security rules and VPC route tables.\n\n## Document_17\n\nFusionHub is Peplink's virtual SpeedFusion appliance that enables the establishment of SpeedFusion connections between cloud servers and physical Peplink units. It supports various Hypervisor Platforms and a growing number of Cloud Platforms, including installation guides for AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Digital Ocean.\n\n## Document_18\n\nFusionHub is Peplink's virtual SpeedFusion appliance that enables the establishment of SpeedFusion connections between cloud servers and physical Peplink units. It supports various Hypervisor Platforms and a growing number of Cloud Platforms, including AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Digital Ocean. The installation guides for these platforms are available in the Peplink forum, with specific pricing noted for Digital Ocean at $5 per month for 1TB of bandwidth.\n\n## Document_19\n\nWhen deploying Peplink's FusionHub on cloud platforms, users may encounter varying costs and latency based on the chosen provider and data center location. For instance, using Microsoft Azure can incur charges for outbound traffic exceeding the free limit, while proximity to data centers can significantly affect latency. A user experienced low latency (under 10ms) with Azure due to a nearby facility, whereas using Peplink's cloud service resulted in higher latency (around 150ms) due to a distant data center in New York.\n\n## Document_20\n\nTo route multiple VLANs through PepVPN using FusionHub in a private cloud, first ensure the router in the untagged LAN can route traffic between all VLANs. Then, enable the 'Route PepVPN traffic to LAN' option in the FusionHub LAN settings. Next, enter static route entries in the router, setting FusionHub as the gateway for all SpeedFusion subnets. Finally, configure outbound policy rules in Balance/MAX devices to enforce all VLAN subnets to route through FusionHub.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo route multiple VLANs through PepVPN in a private cloud deployment of FusionHub, it is necessary to use a VLAN switch to route all SpeedFusion networks to FusionHub. The beta firmware version 6.3.2s002 supports static route configuration, which may be required for this setup.\n\n## Document_22\n\nA WAN topology can consist of multiple remote sites using physical Multi WAN Peplink appliances configured in a full or partial VPN mesh. This setup can include two additional SpeedFusion profiles connecting each remote site to both an active and failover data center, with FusionHub virtual appliances terminating the VPN. The implementation will be possible soon with firmware version 6.3 and OSPF as the routing protocol, allowing for cost settings to control active and failover path usage.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe IPSec VPN feature has been removed from FusionHub, which is a concern for users needing connectivity between Peplink Balance sites and AWS VPCs. The challenge of achieving high availability (HA) between systems in different AWS availability zones is complicated by the lack of Layer2 multicast/broadcast capabilities, preventing the use of protocols like VRRP. Users require alternative mechanisms for redundancy, and while FusionHub can provide redundant paths with routing protocols, it lacks the ability to perform OSPF and provide IPSec VPN, which would facilitate better integration between physical sites and cloud solutions.\n\n## Document_24\n\nFor establishing IPSec VPN connectivity from a FusionHub instance running in AWS, it is important to clarify the routing path involved. The routing path includes a connection from a Peplink HD4 device through a SpeedFusion tunnel to the FusionHub, followed by a connection to a PfSense device and then an IPSec tunnel to the destination network. To troubleshoot or verify this setup, providing a trace route result from the source IP to the destination IP is recommended.\n\n",

Additionally, if there is a router or firewall in front of the Peplink devices, port forwarding must be configured for the default protocols TCP 32015 and UDP 4500 to ensure proper connectivity.\n\n## Document_2\n\nTo create a VPN connection between two Peplink units, specifically the BPL 305 and BPL 310, users can refer to the Balance and MediaFast User Manual for Firmware 7, which is available for download on the Peplink website under the Support section.\n\n## Document_3\n\nTo manage upload bandwidth for Dropbox on a PepLink 20, one can create an outbound policy rule that restricts Dropbox traffic to a single WAN connection. This involves setting the source to the local network (192.168.1.0/24) and the destination to the Dropbox IP block (199.47.216.0/22), using any protocol and applying a priority algorithm. However, implementing QoS may be challenging due to Dropbox using standard ports (80 and 443) for outbound connections.\n\n## Document_4\n\nTo throttle the upload bandwidth consumed by Dropbox on a PepLink 20, one can create an outbound policy rule that specifies the source IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) and the destination IP block for Dropbox (e.g., 199.47.216.0/22). The protocol can be set to ANY, and the algorithm can be either Priority or Enforced. The Priority algorithm allows other upload requests to take precedence, while the Enforced algorithm is stricter, potentially cutting off connectivity if the designated WAN goes down.\n\n## Document_5\n\nPeplink devices currently have limited IPv6 support, primarily allowing basic pass-through of IPv6 traffic from the WAN to the LAN without advanced configuration options. Users can enable IPv6 support on the WAN side, but there is no control over IPv6 traffic routing, LAN configuration, or firewall settings. Additionally, PepVPN does not support native IPv6. While enabling IPv6 may allow devices to access it, this can lead to issues where devices prefer IPv6 over IPv4, potentially bypassing Peplink's traffic control features for services like Google and Netflix.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Peplink Balance 380 supports up to 50 L2TP users in a VPN Site-Client scheme, while the Balance 710 supports up to 200 L2TP users.\n\n## Document_7\n\nPeplink devices support IPv6 passthrough, which can be enabled in the WAN settings. For this feature to work, the WAN router must respond to Stateless Address Autoconfiguration advertisements and DHCPv6 requests. IPv6 clients on the LAN will obtain their IPv6 addresses, gateway, and DNS server addresses from the router, and the device will also acquire an IPv6 address for ping/traceroute checks and web admin access.\n\n## Document_8\n\nPeplink devices support IPv6 in pass-through mode, which allows IPv6 traffic to pass from the LAN to the WAN. However, Peplink does not handle IP address assignment or routing for IPv6; this must be managed by the IPv6 device connected to the WAN.\n\n## Document_9\n\nFor a High Availability (HA) setup with Peplink routers, it is necessary to use the same model for the failover configuration. This means that a BPL-380 or BPL-580 should not be paired with a smaller model like the BPL-210 for failover purposes.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo add a third internet connection to a Peplink load balancer B380, it is necessary to connect the new ADSL link to the balancer and configure the port with the appropriate PPP account for it to function properly.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Balance routers BPL-310, BPL-380, and BPL-580 are supported by InControl2, allowing for remote management. To manage these routers remotely, it is necessary to register them in InControl2 and ensure that the WAN connection method is correctly configured using default settings for optimal functionality.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe Peplink BPL 210 and BPL 30 can establish a site-to-site VPN, indicated by a green VPN icon, allowing successful pings between the routers' LAN IPs. However, issues arise when attempting to ping hosts within the respective networks, suggesting potential configuration problems related to LAN subnets, VLANs, or WAN connections.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Peplink Balance models and Pepwave MAX 700 support IPv6 on a single Ethernet WAN port. When IPv6 support is enabled on a WAN, the WAN router must respond to Stateless Address Autoconfiguration advertisements and DHCPv6 requests. IPv6 clients on the LAN side will obtain their IPv6 address, gateway, and DNS server addresses from the router, which will also acquire an IPv6 address for ping/traceroute checks and web admin access.\n\n## Document_14\n\nPeplink devices have supported IPv6 since firmware version 5.4. The current implementation allows IPv6 support on one of the Ethernet WAN ports, requiring the connected router to respond to Stateless Address Auto Configuration advertisements and DHCPv6 requests. IPv6 clients on the Peplink LAN can acquire their IPv6 addresses, gateway, and DNS server addresses from the WAN. Additionally, the device can obtain an IPv6 address for ping/traceroute checks and web admin access. For devices out of warranty, users can upgrade to the latest firmware for IPv6 support by contacting their local distributor or Peplink directly to discuss warranty extension options if the device is in good condition.\n\n## Document_15\n\nPeplink routers currently have limited support for IPv6, specifically on Balance-series routers where IPv6 can be enabled under Network>WAN settings. This allows the router to respond to Stateless Address Autoconfiguration advertisements and DHCPv6 requests, enabling IPv6 clients on the LAN to acquire necessary addresses. However, this feature is not available on non-Balance routers like the MAX-series BR1. Future firmware updates, specifically version 9, are expected to improve IPv6 support.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo throttle the upload bandwidth consumed by Dropbox on a PepLink 20, one approach is to create an outbound policy rule that targets Dropbox's IP address range. This involves setting the source to the local network (192.168.1.0/24), the destination to the identified Dropbox IP block (199.47.216.0/22), and using the Priority algorithm to manage bandwidth allocation. Additionally, creating rules based on destination domain could also be considered for more flexibility in managing traffic.\n\n## Document_17\n\nWhen using a Peplink Balance 20X with Starlink, enabling IPv6 support in the WAN configuration may lead to MAC address conflicts, as experienced by some users. In one case, the conflicts were resolved by completely disabling IPv6, which was initially running with default settings. After disabling IPv6, the issue did not return for over a month.\n\n## Document_18\n\nTo resolve issues with pinging hosts across a site-to-site VPN between two Peplink devices (BPL 210 and BPL 30), it is necessary to adjust the firewall settings. By default, the firewall may block traffic, so an inbound rule should be added to allow traffic from the LAN (e.g., 192.168.0.0/24) to any destination. This rule needs to be configured on both devices to enable communication between the networks.\n\n## Document_19\n\nPeplink devices currently do not fully support IPv6, and the implementation of full support will occur in phases. Users are advised to continue using IPv4 addresses for the time being.\n\n## Document_20\n\nTo configure a Gateway/Router, specifically the BR1, for dual stack operation with T-Mobile Internet at Home, it is possible to set up the WAN link to use IPv6 while having the capability to fail back to IPv4 if issues arise. There is a mention of T-Mobile being able to announce a /64 IPv6 Prefix, which could be beneficial for the configuration.\n\n",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nThe MediaFast 500 supports all 8 load balancing algorithms, contrary to the initial impression that it only supports 7. This indicates that the specifications for the MediaFast family may not be fully representative of its capabilities regarding load balancing algorithms.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe Peplink Balance family of routers shares a common user manual, which can be accessed online at the provided link. This manual includes information relevant to the Balance Two Unit as well as other models in the family.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe Peplink Balance Series does not support TR-069, but users can manage their devices using InControl2, which is Peplink's network management solution.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThere is a configuration migration tool available for migrating settings between the Peplink Balance 30L and Balance 20 models, but it is not publicly accessible and can be obtained through Peplink support.\n\n## Document_5\n\nPacket loss on the Peplink Balance 5G may occur when the upload throughput exceeds 30Mbps, particularly with ADSL WAN links, which can exhibit similar behavior when upload capacity is saturated. It is important to conduct tests specifically on the physical WAN port to diagnose the issue accurately.\n\n## Document_6\n\nIn a network configuration involving PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is noted that IP Sec tunnels do not typically advertise their routes through second hops. To enable connectivity from satellite sites to Azure, a static route for the Azure subnet can be added on the satellite devices, pointing to the Balance 508. Additionally, firewall configurations on both the satellite sites and Azure may need to be reviewed to ensure they allow the necessary traffic exchange.\n\n## Document_7\n\nIn a network configuration involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 routers connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is important to ensure that outbound rules are correctly set up for traffic to traverse from the satellite sites to Azure. The Balance 508 needs to properly advertise its routes to the connected 305 devices for successful end-to-end connectivity.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe outbound policy configuration on the PepLink Balance 508 was successfully adjusted, allowing the connected Balance 305 devices to traverse to Azure through the established IP Sec VPN tunnels. This indicates that proper routing and policy settings are essential for enabling connectivity between satellite sites and Azure.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe Peplink Balance 300, which is approximately 15 years old, supports a maximum throughput of 20Mbps. Therefore, if clients are experiencing a maximum speed of 15Mbps, this is within the expected performance limits of the device, despite having three WAN connections with a total potential speed of 300Mbps.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe SFP ports on the Peplink Balance 2500-2SFP are capable of supporting a 1 G SFP, allowing for 1Gbps speed operation.\n\n## Document_11\n\nIt is not possible to convert the configuration from a PepLink Balance 310 to a PepLink Balance 210. Additionally, it is important to confirm whether a 3rd WAN activation license has been purchased for the Balance 210 router.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo set up Peplink Balance VPNs for mobile smart devices using public unencrypted WiFi, it is important to configure the L2TP/IPSEC Preshared Key and the User account password correctly. This ensures secure communication over public networks.\n\n## Document_13\n\nTo block ping replies on a Peplink Balance 300, you can disable the ping reply feature for the WAN interface. It is important to confirm the device model, as the Balance 300 is an older model that has been retired.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe latest firmware for the Peplink Balance 20W is v4.8.1, and this model has been obsoleted. Users are advised to consider refreshing their router for updated features and support.\n\n## Document_15\n\nPeplink lists several USB modems from AT&T that are compatible with their Balance Routers, including models such as the AT&T Mobile Hotspot Elevate 4G, MiFi Liberate, and various Sierra Wireless and LG devices. However, the listed modems may not include the latest AT&T products like the AT&T Beam, Unite Pro, Unite, and Velocity. For issues with USB dongle compatibility, users are encouraged to open a support ticket with Peplink for assistance.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe Balance MediaFast family of products supports 7 load balancing algorithms, while the BALANCE family supports 8. The missing algorithm is likely 'fastest response time', which was added most recently. However, it is also possible that the MediaFast reference and datasheets are outdated.\n\n## Document_17\n\nPacket loss in a Peplink Balance 5G device can be caused by issues with the WAN connection between SpeedFusion peers, particularly affecting the wired WAN connection while cellular WANs may function properly. To address packet loss, it is recommended to use Dynamic Weighted Bonding, which prevents packets from being sent through unhealthy tunnels, thereby mitigating the impact of packet loss and high latency. Additionally, it is important to ensure that both devices are upgraded to the necessary firmware version to enable this feature.\n\n## Document_18\n\nTo address packet loss issues with a Peplink Balance 5G via WAN link, it is recommended to test the device by connecting it directly to an internet connection to demonstrate any faults. If errors are found on the WAN1 port causing packet loss while WAN2 operates without issues, this could indicate a physical fault with the WAN1 port, which may lead to an RMA approval. However, if both WAN ports are functioning correctly, Peplink will not authorize an RMA for a device deemed non-faulty.\n\n## Document_19\n\nIf there is packet loss on a Peplink Balance 5G device caused by a physical hardware fault, an RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) can be obtained. Peplink engineering will validate the issue remotely before approving the RMA through the distributor.\n\n## Document_20\n\nTo enable connectivity from PepLink Balance 305 devices to Azure through a Balance 508, static routes can be configured on the Balance 305 for the Azure subnet, using the Balance 508 as the gateway.

    "query": "How can connectivity from multiple Peplink Balance 305 satellite devices to Azure via a Balance 508 gateway be achieved and what routing and firewall considerations must be addressed for successful end-to-end communication through IP Sec VPN tunnels?",
    "answer": "To enable connectivity from multiple Balance 305 devices (satellite sites) to Azure through a Balance 508 gateway over IP Sec VPN tunnels, static routes for the Azure subnet must be added on each Balance 305, using the Balance 508 as the gateway. Similarly, Azure must have a static route for the Balance 305 subnets, also pointing to the Balance 508. Outbound policy rules on the Balance 508 should be configured to allow traffic from the Balance 305 devices to traverse to Azure. Because IP Sec tunnels do not automatically advertise their routes through second hops, these static routes are necessary. Firewalls on both the satellite sites and Azure must be reviewed and configured to permit the required traffic. Additionally, ensuring the Balance 508 properly advertises its routes to the 305 devices and considering subnetting constraints (e.g., static routes may need to point to gateways within the same subnet) is important for seamless routing.",

      "To continue using InControl2 after the warranty period for Peplink devices, users have two main options: maintain the warranty to access the Public Cloud or purchase and host their own Private InControl2 appliance. Alternatively, users can seek a regional partner that hosts a private InControl2 appliance and rent a subscription from them.",
      "To mass add devices for warranty extension and InControl access for a fleet of approximately 100 BR1s, Peplink partners can assist by ordering all licenses in one go if the serial numbers are provided. Users can choose to extend only the InControl 2 license or extend the warranty of the products, which includes the InControl 2 license.",
      "The conversation discusses the renewal process for InControl 2 (IC2) subscriptions for Peplink devices, highlighting concerns about the availability and pricing of IC2 only subscriptions. It mentions that the user was able to renew their IC2 subscription for one device and inquired about the status of IC2 access for two other devices that were previously available at a lower cost. The user expresses a desire to maintain operational status for their existing equipment without incurring high costs for warranty coverage. Additionally, it is noted that PepVPN/SpeedFusion links may remain operational even if IC2 access lapses temporarily, ensuring continued management access to remote units."
    ],
    "query": "For a Peplink MAX Transit device that is out of warranty, what are the available options for maintaining InControl 2 (IC2) access, and how do Extended Warranty, InControl 2 Subscription, and SmartCare/TotalCare differ in coverage, eligibility, and applicability to this device?",
    "answer": "For a Peplink MAX Transit device that is out of warranty, you can maintain IC2 access by purchasing an InControl 2 Subscription (typically available for 12 or 24 months), as this option is available for MAX Transit and similar models. Alternatively, you could purchase an Extended Warranty, which includes both hardware coverage and IC2 access for one or two years. SmartCare or TotalCare are premium options primarily for enterprise-grade models, and may not be applicable to all models like MAX Transit. The IC2 Subscription is more affordable, provides only IC2 access, and does not restore hardware warranty. Extended Warranty restores both hardware coverage and IC2 access. SmartCare/TotalCare, where available, offer full coverage including hardware warranty, IC2 access, telephone support, and advance replacement, but SmartCare/TotalCare is generally reserved for higher-end or enterprise models, not necessarily MAX Transit. For renewal, you may need to provide serial numbers to Peplink or a partner. If you only need IC2 manageability and not hardware coverage, the IC2 Subscription is the most cost-effective choice for the MAX Transit.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nIt is possible to combine two different speeds of internet connections in Peplink devices using load balancing or SpeedFusion bonding. However, the combined speed will not equal the sum of the two connections (e.g., 80 Mbps) for a single stream due to overhead involved in the process.\n\n## Document_2\n\nPeplink devices can perform link aggregation or bonding, but this requires setting up a Site-to-Site VPN between two Peplink Balance models 210 or higher; the Balance 30 does not support aggregation. In a typical load balancing scenario, the Peplink Balance utilizes all available WAN connections to optimize bandwidth usage, particularly beneficial in multi-user environments. However, for single-user sessions, the speed is limited to the WAN link being used. Once a Site-to-Site VPN is established, the VPN treats all WAN connections as a single large pipe, allowing traffic to be distributed across all links, which can improve performance.\n\n## Document_3\n\nFor a setup involving a primary fiber internet connection and a backup cable internet connection, the Peplink Balance Two is recommended as it offers two Gigabit WAN ports. This allows for prioritization of WAN connections, enabling one to become active if the other goes down, or for load balancing to utilize both connections simultaneously. SpeedFusion bonding is an option but requires an additional license, which may not be necessary for this particular setup.\n\n## Document_4\n\nTo increase bandwidth and speed by joining an Ethernet WAN connection and a cellular connection on a Peplink Balance 30 Pro, one can utilize SpeedFusion technology. SpeedFusion allows for bandwidth bonding, which combines multiple internet connections for improved performance. The user should consider the differences between SpeedFusion, SpeedFusion Cloud, and FusionHub, as these options provide various capabilities for establishing tunnels and managing connections, particularly when remote equipment is involved.\n\n## Document_5\n\nLoad balancing does not combine multiple WAN connections into a single high-speed link; it steers traffic over multiple WAN connections while using them separately. To achieve the sum of all WAN connections for upload speeds using a secure connection, Peplink's SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding solution is required. This involves setting up a VPN tunnel between two Peplink devices, allowing the four WAN connections to be bonded into one high-speed link. It is important to note that the other end of the SpeedFusion VPN tunnel must have a WAN connection with at least 80 Mbps speeds to effectively combine the four 20 Mbps WAN connections.\n\n## Document_6\n\nPeplink SpeedFusion technology allows for the bonding of multiple internet connections to provide a combined bandwidth, enhancing throughput and redundancy. It utilizes built-in VPN technology to achieve this, differentiating it from simple load balancing. To implement SpeedFusion, both ends of the connection must utilize Peplink devices, as SpeedFusion requires compatible hardware to function effectively. The proposed setup involves using a Peplink 710 in the main office with multiple ADSL connections and a Peplink Balance 20 at home or branch offices to achieve increased download speeds through bonded connections.\n\n## Document_7\n\nFor bonding 4 ADSL WAN lines with a Pepwave Balance 50, it is suggested that a Balance One with a SpeedFusion license or models 210, 380, and above may be necessary, as the Balance 50 may not support SpeedFusion. If the LAN configuration involves a large number of devices, particularly with subnets of the sizes mentioned (10.73.10.0/23 and 10.84.0.0/16), a more powerful model such as the Balance 710 or above is recommended to handle the traffic and VPN requirements effectively. For networks with up to 100 devices, a Balance One with SpeedFusion may suffice, but for 100-400 devices, a Balance 580 or Balance 710 is advised for better performance.\n\n## Document_8\n\nFor achieving a reliable and fast connection by bonding multiple ADSL WAN connections, the Peplink Balance series is recommended, particularly models that support SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding. The Balance 50 has 5 WAN ports but does not support SpeedFusion, which means it cannot perform bandwidth bonding. The cheapest Balance router with WAN bonding capability should be identified based on specific needs. Additionally, the MediaFast capability enhances performance for specific applications, but details on its functionality were not provided in the conversation.\n\n## Document_9\n\nTo achieve faster internet speeds by combining multiple connections, a Peplink Balance 50 can be considered for bandwidth aggregation through internet Link Load Balancing. It is important to note that internet browsing speed is also dependent on the remote server and that session load balancing should function effectively. When using SpeedFusion for bonding WANs, factors such as bandwidth overhead for IPSEC/SpeedFusion and the actual point-to-point speeds between devices must be taken into account, as the available WAN speeds may not translate directly to bonded speeds due to various connection factors.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo achieve faster internet speeds using a Peplink Balance device, WAN load balancing (Aggregation) can be utilized to distribute internet traffic across multiple WAN connections. However, bonded WAN speed will only be effective for the ISP connected to the Balance device. SpeedFusion Bonding can combine all available WANs, but it requires consideration of additional bandwidth for rerouting traffic, especially if using a UK site. For optimal performance, a Balance 380 is recommended for the UK site with 2 x 100/20 Mbps connections, while a Balance 210 is suggested for the user's site with 1 x 13/1 Mbps and 1 x 10/0.5 Mbps connections. It's important to note that SpeedFusion Bonding may not significantly assist with tasks requiring high upload speeds, such as backing up large data collections to the cloud.\n\n## Document_11\n\nTo achieve true line bonding for merging three internet lines, SpeedFusion technology is required, which necessitates two SpeedFusion capable devices like a Balance 310 at each end. Alternatively, load balancing can distribute traffic from multiple simultaneous network boots across different WANs, allowing each session to be routed through a single WAN, thus maintaining one public IP per session. While load balancing will not increase the speed of a single boot, it can enhance the overall performance by allowing multiple boots to load faster.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo achieve bonded connectivity that combines the speeds of multiple WAN connections on a single PC, SpeedFusion technology is required, as load balancing alone will not accomplish this. The original poster's attempt to use load balancing with a Peplink Balance 30 to aggregate three WANs into one speed was misguided, as load balancing distributes traffic rather than bonding it.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Peplink Balance 30 does not automatically bond multiple WAN connections to aggregate their speeds into a single connection. Instead, it utilizes load balancing, which allows for improved download speeds by distributing traffic across the available WANs. Users can achieve better performance by ensuring proper configuration of load balancing settings and testing with different servers. For true bonding of WAN connections, additional configurations such as using a cloud server with VPN protocols like PPTP or OpenVPN may be necessary, but this approach can be complex and may not guarantee reliability compared to using the Peplink's built-in features.\n\n## Document_14\n\nPeplink SpeedFusion establishes concurrent VPN tunnels across multiple WAN connections, allowing for bonded bandwidth and instant failover. This technology distributes VPN traffic across these tunnels, maximizing available bandwidth. In the event of a WAN disconnection, the concurrent tunnels provide resilience by routing traffic through healthy connections, maintaining VPN sessions without downtime. Unlike IPsec VPN, which can take significant time to detect disconnections and re-establish connections, Peplink SpeedFusion ensures seamless operation. Additionally, it offers built-in dynamic routing capabilities, allowing users to route all traffic or only private network traffic through the VPN, enabling configurations such as star topology or mesh networks.\n\n## Document_15\n\nWithout SpeedFusion enabled, having two connections set to priority 1 will allow for failover when one connection drops, but it will not provide load balancing in the sense of combining speeds from both connections. Load balancing can direct traffic over multiple connections, but it does not aggregate bandwidth from WAN A and WAN B. SpeedFusion, on the other hand, tunnels traffic down multiple paths and combines it into a single reliable connection, but it may reduce overall speeds due to the overhead involved in the bonding process.\n\n## Document_16\n\nSpeedFusion is a tunnel bonded VPN technology that aggregates multiple internet connections to create a session-persistent and reliable VPN connection between two Peplink endpoints. It operates using AES 256-bit and 4096 DH encrypted tunnels, allowing for secure communication across various WAN circuits. Only the Hub site needs to have public or publicly accessible IP addresses, while peer sites can operate behind NAT or CGNAT, making it versatile for modern networking environments. SpeedFusion is easier to set up than traditional IPsec VPNs and offers greater capabilities, including the ability to bond multiple connections such as 5G and cable modems. The SDX router can support up to 200 remote peers, and configurations can be adjusted to avoid IP conflicts, ensuring seamless connectivity.\n\n## Document_17\n\nFor a setup involving a primary fiber internet connection and a backup cable internet connection, a Peplink Balance 20X with firmware 8.3 is recommended. The Virtual WAN feature allows for the integration of two wired WANs, and it also provides the option to use a cellular WAN as a fallback. Additionally, switching the Orbi Wifi 6e router into AP mode may be necessary for proper functionality in this configuration.\n\n## Document_18\n\nWhen considering a Peplink Balance product for a dual WAN setup with a primary fiber connection and a backup cable connection, it is important to note that a Virtual WAN license is required for a second WAN, which necessitates VLAN tagging for one of the connections. The Peplink Balance 20X has a more powerful CPU than the Balance Two and includes an embedded cellular modem, offering a potential third WAN option for backup. Additionally, the Balance 20X is more cost-effective than the Balance Two.\n\n## Document_19\n\nTo achieve bandwidth bonding on a Peplink Balance 30 Pro, a license add-on is required. Bandwidth bonding can only be accomplished over a PepVPN/SpeedFusion tunnel, necessitating a second tunnel endpoint such as FusionHub or another router. When configuring the tunnel profile, all WAN connections should be set to priority 1 to enable bonding. The maximum throughput for the Balance 30 Pro is 120 Mbps without AES-256 encryption and 55 Mbps with it.\n\n## Document_20\n\nTo join an Ethernet WAN connection and a cellular connection for increased bandwidth and speed on a Peplink Balance 30 Pro, a Speedfusion Bonding License (SKU: BPL-031-PRO-LC-SF) is required. Speedfusion Bonding is a VPN technology that aggregates the bandwidth of WAN connections, and it can utilize Speedfusion Cloud, a prepaid service from Peplink, to manage the connections and transmit requests to the desired endpoint.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo achieve the sum of multiple lines for upload using a secure connection, SpeedFusion technology can be utilized. This technology allows for the bonding of multiple internet connections, which can be implemented using a Peplink Balance Router or a FusionHub Virtual Appliance hosted in the cloud. This setup can enhance the performance of secure connections, such as those used by software like Aspera, by combining the bandwidth of all available lines.\n\n## Document_22\n\nTo achieve a reliable and fast connection using multiple ADSL WAN connections, SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding requires two Peplink devices and is supported in Balance models 210, 310, and above. However, Internet Link Load Balancing can be achieved with the existing setup without the need for SpeedFusion. MediaFast is a feature of certain Balance routers that provides caching capabilities to enhance performance.\n\n## Document_23\n\nTo achieve a reliable and fast connection by bonding three ADSL WAN connections, a Peplink Balance device with SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding is recommended. SpeedFusion allows for the bonding of multiple WAN connections to create a single, faster connection for internet use, including web, VoIP, and Skype. The Balance 50 does not support SpeedFusion, which means it cannot perform bandwidth bonding. For testing SpeedFusion, FusionHub can be used as a software-only solution. When using SpeedFusion, it is possible to bond connections from multiple WAN providers and send the combined bandwidth to the internet, provided that the remote VPS has sufficient bandwidth. The best operating system for a VPS running SpeedFusion is not specified, but it is implied that SpeedFusion may not require a traditional operating system. For local setups, a server with multiple Ethernet ports is needed to connect the WANs and provide a single LAN output, and the best operating system for such a server is not detailed.\n\n## Document_24\n\nTo achieve bandwidth bonding for multiple ADSL WAN connections, SpeedFusion technology is necessary, which requires two SpeedFusion capable devices to establish a VPN tunnel. This setup allows traffic to be split across all available WAN connections, with packets being re-ordered and sent out through the internet from the other end of the tunnel. The basic version of SpeedFusion supports connections to up to five remote locations. Additionally, SpeedFusion can be installed on various virtual machine platforms, including Amazon Web Services, VMware, Citrix XenServer, Oracle VirtualBox, and Microsoft Hyper-V, depending on network requirements.\n\n## Document_25\n\nTo achieve a reliable and fast connection by bonding multiple ADSL WAN connections, a Balance router is recommended over FusionHub, which is a virtual appliance with only one WAN port and operates on a hypervisor. SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding is essential for creating bonded WAN connections, and the Balance 50 device, while having five WAN ports, does not support SpeedFusion, meaning it cannot perform bandwidth bonding. MediaFast capability is mentioned but not explained in the response.\n\n## Document_26\n\nTo achieve a reliable and fast connection by bonding multiple ADSL WAN connections, a Balance Router is recommended, specifically models B210 or higher, which support SpeedFusion for bandwidth bonding. SpeedFusion allows the combination of total bandwidth from all WANs into a single connection. Balance One and B305 do not come with SpeedFusion but can be upgraded with a software license. PepVPN is available on all Balance routers but does not provide bonding as it only utilizes one active WAN connection in the VPN tunnel. SpeedFusion VPN requires TCP 32015 and UDP 4500 for traffic establishment.\n\n## Document_27\n\nFor achieving a reliable and fast connection by bonding multiple ADSL WAN connections, the Peplink Balance 210 or 310 and higher models support SpeedFusion, which is essential for bandwidth bonding. The Balance 50 does not support a SpeedFusion license upgrade, limiting its capability for bandwidth bonding. SpeedFusion uses TCP port 32015 and UDP port 4500 for establishing VPN tunnels, which can be changed if certain ports are blocked by government regulations. The Balance One and Balance 305 are also capable of software upgrades for SpeedFusion.\n\n",

The Peplink Balance 20X has a more powerful CPU than the Balance Two and includes an embedded cellular modem, offering a potential third WAN option for backup. Additionally, the Balance 20X is more cost-effective than the Balance Two.",
      "To achieve bandwidth bonding on a Peplink Balance 30 Pro, a license add-on is required. Bandwidth bonding can only be accomplished over a PepVPN/SpeedFusion tunnel, necessitating a second tunnel endpoint such as FusionHub or another router. When configuring the tunnel profile, all WAN connections should be set to priority 1 to enable bonding. The maximum throughput for the Balance 30 Pro is 120 Mbps without AES-256 encryption and 55 Mbps with it.",
      "To join an Ethernet WAN connection and a cellular connection for increased bandwidth and speed on a Peplink Balance 30 Pro, a Speedfusion Bonding License (SKU: BPL-031-PRO-LC-SF) is required. Speedfusion Bonding is a VPN technology that aggregates the bandwidth of WAN connections, and it can utilize Speedfusion Cloud, a prepaid service from Peplink, to manage the connections and transmit requests to the desired endpoint.",
      "To achieve the sum of multiple lines for upload using a secure connection, SpeedFusion technology can be utilized. This technology allows for the bonding of multiple internet connections, which can be implemented using a Peplink Balance Router or a FusionHub Virtual Appliance hosted in the cloud. This setup can enhance the performance of secure connections, such as those used by software like Aspera, by combining the bandwidth of all available lines.",
      "To achieve a reliable and fast connection using multiple ADSL WAN connections, SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding requires two Peplink devices and is supported in Balance models 210, 310, and above. However, Internet Link Load Balancing can be achieved with the existing setup without the need for SpeedFusion. MediaFast is a feature of certain Balance routers that provides caching capabilities to enhance performance.",
      "To achieve a reliable and fast connection by bonding three ADSL WAN connections, a Peplink Balance device with SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding is recommended. SpeedFusion allows for the bonding of multiple WAN connections to create a single, faster connection for internet use, including web, VoIP, and Skype. The Balance 50 does not support SpeedFusion, which means it cannot perform bandwidth bonding. For testing SpeedFusion, FusionHub can be used as a software-only solution. When using SpeedFusion, it is possible to bond connections from multiple WAN providers and send the combined bandwidth to the internet, provided that the remote VPS has sufficient bandwidth. The best operating system for a VPS running SpeedFusion is not specified, but it is implied that SpeedFusion may not require a traditional operating system. For local setups, a server with multiple Ethernet ports is needed to connect the WANs and provide a single LAN output, and the best operating system for such a server is not detailed.",
      "To achieve bandwidth bonding for multiple ADSL WAN connections, SpeedFusion technology is necessary, which requires two SpeedFusion capable devices to establish a VPN tunnel. This setup allows traffic to be split across all available WAN connections, with packets being re-ordered and sent out through the internet from the other end of the tunnel. The basic version of SpeedFusion supports connections to up to five remote locations. Additionally, SpeedFusion can be installed on various virtual machine platforms, including Amazon Web Services, VMware, Citrix XenServer, Oracle VirtualBox, and Microsoft Hyper-V, depending on network requirements.",
      "To achieve a reliable and fast connection by bonding multiple ADSL WAN connections, a Balance router is recommended over FusionHub, which is a virtual appliance with only one WAN port and operates on a hypervisor. SpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding is essential for creating bonded WAN connections, and the Balance 50 device, while having five WAN ports, does not support SpeedFusion, meaning it cannot perform bandwidth bonding. MediaFast capability is mentioned but not explained in the response.",
      "To achieve a reliable and fast connection by bonding multiple ADSL WAN connections, a Balance Router is recommended, specifically models B210 or higher, which support SpeedFusion for bandwidth bonding. SpeedFusion allows the combination of total bandwidth from all WANs into a single connection. Balance One and B305 do not come with SpeedFusion but can be upgraded with a software license. PepVPN is available on all Balance routers but does not provide bonding as it only utilizes one active WAN connection in the VPN tunnel. SpeedFusion VPN requires TCP 32015 and UDP 4500 for traffic establishment.",
      "For achieving a reliable and fast connection by bonding multiple ADSL WAN connections, the Peplink Balance 210 or 310 and higher models support SpeedFusion, which is essential for bandwidth bonding. The Balance 50 does not support a SpeedFusion license upgrade, limiting its capability for bandwidth bonding. SpeedFusion uses TCP port 32015 and UDP port 4500 for establishing VPN tunnels, which can be changed if certain ports are blocked by government regulations. The Balance One and Balance 305 are also capable of software upgrades for SpeedFusion."

    "query": "How can you achieve bonded bandwidth using multiple WAN connections on Peplink Balance devices, and what are the key hardware, software, and configuration requirements and limitations, including model support, licensing, and expected performance impacts for single-user and multi-user scenarios?",
    "answer": "To achieve bonded bandwidth using multiple WAN connections on Peplink Balance devices, you must use SpeedFusion technology, which requires at least two SpeedFusion-capable Peplink devices (hardware or FusionHub virtual appliance) at each endpoint. Not all models support SpeedFusion: Balance 210, 310, 305, 380, 580, 710, and above do, while Balance 30 and Balance 50 do not (and cannot be upgraded). Balance One and Balance 305 require a software license for SpeedFusion. For the Balance 30 Pro, a license add-on is also required. SpeedFusion aggregates multiple WANs to provide a single high-speed, session-persistent VPN connection, but the actual combined bandwidth for a single stream may be less than the sum of the WANs due to overhead. For multi-user environments, load balancing alone can optimize bandwidth by steering multiple sessions over different WANs, but only SpeedFusion can bond bandwidth for single-user sessions. The setup requires configuring a PepVPN/SpeedFusion tunnel between compatible devices, with all WANs set to priority 1 for proper bonding. Both endpoints must have sufficient bandwidth to realize the benefits. SpeedFusion uses TCP 32015 and UDP 4500 by default. Performance may be reduced by encryption overhead, and the practical maximum throughput depends on the model. For large LANs or high traffic, higher-end models are recommended. SpeedFusion can also be deployed using FusionHub on virtual platforms for flexible endpoint options.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_4\n\nThe default LAN configuration on a Peplink Balance cannot be assigned a VLAN tag because untagged LANs do not belong to any VLAN; data packets require a VLAN tag to be part of a VLAN. Additionally, when specifying a subnet, it is standard to use the network address format (e.g., 192.168.254.0/24) rather than an individual host address (e.g., 192.168.254.1/24).\n\n## Document_5\n\nTo configure VLANs on a switch connected to a Peplink device, it is advisable to allow both untagged and tagged VLANs between the Peplink and the switch. This is because switches utilize untagged traffic for various communication protocols that do not support tagging. Limiting traffic should be managed through the switch configuration rather than solely relying on the Peplink settings.\n\n## Document_6\n\nIn a network configuration where Port1 is set to access the default Untagged VLAN10 and Port2 is configured as a trunk for Tagged VLAN2, there may be an issue accessing the default VLAN10 when Port2 is set to trunk mode. This configuration works correctly when both ports are set to access mode, allowing devices connected to Port1 to access VLAN10. If a device connected to Port1 cannot access VLAN10 when Port2 is set to trunk, it may indicate a potential bug in the system, warranting a support ticket to be logged for further investigation.\n\n## Document_7\n\nTo reserve static IP addresses for devices connected to a Peplink router and prevent conflicts, it is important to ensure that the DHCP server is configured correctly. While assigning a static IP to a MAC address can work, it does not prevent other devices from being manually set to the same IP address. The conversation suggests a need for a method to deny users from assigning static IPs that are already reserved. Additionally, the setup involves a VLAN configuration, with the main LAN being untagged on Port 1 and the VLAN on Port 2 of the Peplink Balance router.\n\n## Document_8\n\nTo block outbound traffic on SMTP Port 25 for all internal devices while allowing it for a specific internal IP on a Peplink Balance 380, two outbound firewall rules should be configured. The first rule should allow traffic on Port 25 from the specific IP address, and the second rule should deny Port 25 traffic from all other IP addresses. It is important to ensure that the allow rule is positioned above the deny rule in the configuration.\n\n## Document_9\n\nTo limit inbound SMTP traffic on port 25 to only come from a spam blocking provider using a Peplink Balance router, you can set up an inbound firewall rule under Network > Firewall > Access Rules. The rule should specify TCP as the protocol for SMTP, with the source IP set to the spam blocker's IP address and the destination set to the internal email server's IP address on port 25. A default rule should be set to deny all other traffic.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo optimize antenna performance for the Pepwave MAX BR1 5G, it is important that antennas connected to the ports match the frequency bands used by the local tower, specifically for 5G bands such as 850MHz and 3700MHz. Antennas can be oriented at various angles, including horizontal and vertical, or at slant angles of 45 degrees, but significant separation between elements is not necessary. The effectiveness of 4G versus 5G signals can vary based on the specific tower and carrier, and at close distances, using antennas with too much gain may not be beneficial; simpler antennas may suffice.\n\n## Document_11\n\nAn untagged LAN refers to the default LAN configuration, which is acceptable for basic setups. To ensure proper WiFi connection setup, it is important to verify that the WiFi is enabled on the dashboard, that a WiFi SSID and password are configured, and that the WiFi antenna is connected and broadcasting is turned on.\n\n## Document_12\n\nIn a network using a Balance 380 as an AP controller with Peplink AP One AX devices, devices connected to the same AP within a tagged VLAN are unable to communicate with each other, while devices on different APs in the same VLAN can communicate. The management VLAN is untagged and functions correctly, allowing communication between devices. The issue may be related to the configuration of the tagged VLANs on the specific AP, as there are no routing issues within the VLAN, and devices in different VLANs can communicate without problems.\n\n## Document_13\n\nTo reserve IP addresses for devices with static IPs outside of the DHCP range on a Peplink device, navigate to the Network tab and select the appropriate LAN for DHCP reservation. Fill in the necessary fields to complete the reservation. Alternatively, you can reserve the current IP address for a device by going to the Status tab, selecting 'Client List', and clicking the 'label' button next to the device.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo block outbound traffic on SMTP Port 25 for all internal devices while allowing it for a specific internal IP on a Peplink Balance 380, the firewall rules should be configured correctly. The block rule should specify 'Any Port' for the source, while the allow rule should only specify the destination port as 25, since the source port will be a random number due to many-to-one NAT. This configuration ensures that the email server can communicate outbound while blocking unauthorized traffic.\n\n## Document_15\n\nTo limit inbound SMTP traffic on port 25 to only come from a spam blocking provider, the email rule should be set to 'Allow' with the protocol TCP for SMTP, specifying the spam blocker's public IP address as the source and the internal email server's private IP address as the destination. The default rule must be set to 'Deny'. It is important to use the internal address for the email server and to specify a network with the proper mask if allowing an entire network instead of a single IP address.\n\n## Document_16\n\nFor optimal performance with the Pepwave Max BR1 5G, it is recommended to use identical antennas on each of the four ports, as mixing different antennas is not advisable. Given the user's proximity to the tower, a panel-style MIMO directional antenna may be more suitable than a Yagi antenna. The user reported a signal degradation after switching to 5G, with an average SINR of around 8 dB, while previously achieving better signal metrics with 4G. The user is connecting primarily to band 5 (850 MHz) and band 77 (3700 MHz) for 5G.\n\n## Document_17\n\nWhen using a Peplink Balance 380 as an AP controller with multiple Peplink AP One AX devices, issues may arise where devices connected to the same AP in a tagged VLAN cannot communicate with each other, while devices on different APs in the same VLAN can. This may be related to settings such as 'Block all Private IP' under the Guest Protect feature of the AP's wireless SSID, which could prevent communication between clients on the same AP. However, communication between devices in different VLANs and on the untagged management VLAN is expected if Inter-VLAN routing is enabled.\n\n",

    "query": "How do untagged and tagged VLAN configurations on Peplink Balance and connected switches affect device connectivity and network setup, and what issues can arise if ports are set to access versus trunk modes?",
    "answer": "Untagged VLANs represent the default LAN and cannot be assigned a VLAN tag on Peplink Balance devices; only tagged networks are considered part of a VLAN. When connecting a Peplink Balance to a switch, both untagged and tagged VLANs should be permitted between the devices because some protocols require untagged traffic. Limiting which VLANs are allowed should be managed through the switch, not just on the Peplink. When configuring ports, if Port1 is set to access the default untagged VLAN and Port2 is set as a trunk for a tagged VLAN, devices on Port1 may lose access to the default VLAN if Port2 is in trunk mode—a potential bug that may require support intervention. In general, both ports set to access mode allow for proper connectivity on the untagged VLAN. For static IP reservations and DHCP, ensure that the DHCP server is configured for the untagged LAN on Port1 and tagged VLANs on Port2 to prevent conflicts. VLAN and port mode misconfiguration can lead to device isolation or connectivity issues, especially in environments with both tagged and untagged traffic.",

It is important to keep the PrimeCare subscription active to avoid losing Fusion link functionality. Additionally, users may need to adjust the MTU settings for reliable connections, depending on the internet service used.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe special firmware version 8.1.1s118 allows Peplink routers to manage a Starlink dish connected via WAN ports in DHCP/NAT mode. Users can configure the WAN connection settings to use DHCP and set a management IP address in the range of 192.168.100.2 to 192.168.100.254, enabling access to the Starlink dish at the IP address 192.168.100.1. This feature is useful for managing devices connected to the Peplink router.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo manage devices like the Starlink dish or an AT&T DSL modem through a Peplink router, the WAN connection should be set to DHCP mode, and a management IP address within the appropriate subnet must be assigned. For the Starlink dish, the management IP can range from 192.168.100.2 to 192.168.100.254, allowing access via 192.168.100.1. For other devices, such as an AT&T DSL modem, a different IP within the same subnet should be used, for example, using 192.168.3.2 to access a modem at 192.168.3.1.\n\n## Document_15\n\nTo manage a Starlink dish connected to a Peplink Balance router, it is necessary to pass through the IP address 192.168.100.1 to WAN1. Users have attempted various configurations including setting outbound policies for all WANs, adding the IP as an additional IP, creating NAT rules, and adjusting firewall settings, but have been unsuccessful in achieving connectivity to the Starlink admin interface. The Starlink device may restrict access to its admin interface to clients within its subnet, which could be a reason for the inability to ping the address except during the initial boot-up.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo manage a Starlink dish connected to a Peplink router, an outbound policy rule should be created with the source set to Any and the destination set to the IP address 192.168.100.1, using the Enforced algorithm directed to the Starlink WAN. This configuration allows LAN clients to access the management app for the Starlink dish.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo connect a Starlink dish to a Peplink router and manage it via the management app, the dish's IP address (192.168.100.1) needs to be accessible through WAN1. Attempts to configure this include setting outbound policies for all WANs, adding the IP as an additional IP, creating NAT rules, and adjusting firewall settings. However, the IP is only reachable during the initial boot of the dish, indicating it may not respond to pings at other times, complicating the management setup.\n\n## Document_18\n\nTo manage a Starlink dish connected to a Peplink Balance router, it may be necessary to pass through the IP address 192.168.100.1 to WAN1. This can potentially be achieved by adding a Static Route for the 192.168.100.0/24 subnet to the gateway IP of the Starlink interface. Additionally, it is noted that running firmware version 8.1.1 may be required for certain features to function correctly in drop-in mode.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe Starlink dish initially boots up with a gateway IP of 192.168.1.1, which then changes to 100.82.xxx.yyy with a default gateway of 100.27.aaa.bbb after renegotiation. The subnet mask used is 255.192.0.0. When attempting to set a static route, an error occurs indicating that the gateway 100.82.xxx.yyy is not on the local network. The WAN is configured in DHCP/NAT mode rather than drop-in mode.\n\n## Document_20\n\nTo connect a Starlink dish to a Peplink Balance router and manage it through a LAN client, it is suggested to add a route to the 192.168.100.1 address with a netmask of 0.0.0.0 on the WAN interface, or to add the entire 192.168.100.0/24 subnet. This allows the router to broadcast an ARP request for 192.168.100.1 and communicate directly with its MAC address. However, Peplink devices do not allow static routes on WAN interfaces, and outbound policies may result in packets being tagged with the default router's MAC address, which could prevent communication if the Starlink hardware only responds to its own MAC. An alternative solution involves using a spare WAN port with a switch to connect the Starlink and configure it for OOB communication.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo manage a Starlink dish connected to a Peplink Balance router, it is necessary to pass through the IP address 192.168.100.1 to the WAN1 interface. Attempts to configure this using outbound policies, NAT rules, and firewall settings may not succeed if the device does not respond to pings or is hidden from the network. Using the CLI interface, one can ping the IP from the WAN interface and check the ARP table to determine connectivity. If the device is unreachable, a static route may be required. FusionHub supports WAN static routes, and alternative methods such as using a secondary WAN interface or bridging with another router may be necessary to manage the Starlink device securely.\n\n",

    "query": "What is the required configuration and firmware for reliably managing a Starlink dish via a Peplink router, and what troubleshooting steps and limitations should a technician be aware of when access to the Starlink dish's management interface at 192.168.100.1 is not working as expected?",
    "answer": "To reliably manage a Starlink dish via a Peplink router, the router must be running special firmware version 8.1.1s118 and be configured with the WAN connection method set to DHCP/NAT mode and automatic DNS. The management IP address for the Peplink router should be set within the range 192.168.100.2 to 192.168.100.254, which enables access to the Starlink dish's management interface at 192.168.100.1. After applying these settings, LAN clients should be able to reach the management app.\n\nIf access does not work as expected, first confirm that firmware 8.1.1s118 is installed and the above network settings are correct. Next, create an outbound policy with the source set to \"Any\", destination set to 192.168.100.1, and use the Enforced algorithm directed to the Starlink WAN. Be aware that some Peplink models (such as Balance One) do not support this feature, and that the Starlink dish may only respond to pings at boot-up, limiting interface availability. Also, static routes cannot be set on WAN interfaces on many Peplink devices, and outbound policies may fail if the Starlink dish only responds to requests with its own MAC address.\n\nFor reliable firmware updates, use a Windows device connected via Ethernet rather than Wi-Fi or Mac.

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nPeplink's high availability (HA) feature operates on a master/slave architecture, where one router is designated as the master and the other as a backup. The backup router remains inactive while the master is operational, only becoming active if the master fails. This implementation does not support a peer-to-peer relationship where both routers can independently manage their own WANs and VLANs while providing backup for each other. The HA configuration requires synchronization of settings between the master and slave, which is optional but necessary for the slave to be prepared for activation in case of a master failure. If synchronization is not enabled, the slave must be manually configured to match the master.\n\n## Document_2\n\nIn a high availability (HA) setup using Peplink Balance routers in NAT mode, VRRP is utilized for WAN as well as LAN configurations. When properly configured, VRRP allows for the transfer of WAN addresses from the master router to the slave router in the event of a failure. This means that only one public IP address is needed for the HA setup, as the slave router will take over the master router's public IP address upon failure, rather than requiring multiple public IP addresses for each router.\n\n## Document_3\n\nIn a high availability (HA) setup for Peplink Balance routers in NAT mode, the LAN configuration requires a Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) setup with a virtual IP (VIP) for the master and slave units. For the WAN configuration, two options are presented. Option 1 requires three VRRP groups: one for the LAN and one for each ISP, necessitating a total of six public IP addresses. Option 2 suggests a simpler configuration with only two public IP addresses, where the master unit handles both WAN connections and the slave unit takes over the WAN IP address upon failover. The WAN setup involves two ISPs, each with its own subnet and gateway.\n\n## Document_4\n\nPeplink Balance devices, specifically models 210 and above, support High Availability (HA) failover using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). In an HA setup, periodic VRRP advertisement packets are sent from the master device to specific IP multicast addresses, allowing the slave device to take over if the master fails. The virtual IP (VIP) serves as the default gateway for LAN devices, and both master and slave units must be on the same subnet with a unique HA group identifier. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave to automatically apply changes from the master every five minutes, but this locks the slave's web admin interface until disabled. Failover typically occurs within 10-15 seconds, and both devices must be connected to the internet in the same mode, either NAT or Drop-in mode, with the VIP set as the default gateway for LAN hosts.\n\n## Document_5\n\nIn a 1+1 Backup configuration using Peplink Balance devices or MAX 700/HD, High Availability (HA) failover is achieved through the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). The master device sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets, and if these are not received within a specified time, the slave device takes over. Both devices must be on the same subnet and use the same HA group identifier. The virtual IP address (VIP) serves as the default gateway for all LAN hosts. Configuration for the master and slave units involves enabling HA, setting preferred roles, and configuring LAN IP addresses. In the event of a failover, the slave device's WAN connections become active and use the same IP address as the master device, with a typical recovery time of 10-15 seconds. The setup can be configured in either NAT mode or Drop-in mode, with specific requirements for each.\n\n## Document_6\n\nPeplink Balance devices, specifically the Balance 210 or above and MAX 700/HD, support High Availability (HA) failover using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). In an HA setup, the master device sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets to specific multicast addresses, allowing the slave device to take over if the master fails. The configuration requires both devices to be on the same subnet and use the same HA group identifier. The virtual IP (VIP) serves as the default gateway for all LAN hosts. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave unit to automatically apply changes from the master unit. The failover process typically takes 10-15 seconds, and both devices must be connected to the internet in the same mode, either NAT or Drop-in mode.\n\n## Document_7\n\nPeplink Balance devices, specifically the Balance 210 and above, and MAX 700/HD, support High Availability (HA) failover using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). In an HA setup, the master device sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets to specific multicast addresses, allowing the slave device to take over if the master fails. The configuration requires both devices to be on the same subnet and utilize the same HA group identifier. The virtual IP address (VIP) serves as the default gateway for devices on the LAN segment. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave unit to automatically apply changes from the master every 5 minutes, or it can be configured manually. Failover typically occurs within 10-15 seconds, and both devices must be connected to the internet in the same mode, either NAT or Drop-in mode, with the VIP set as the default gateway for the LAN segment.\n\n## Document_8\n\nTo implement a 1+1 Backup with Peplink Balance devices or MAX 700/HD, both devices must operate in active-standby mode, utilizing High Availability (HA) failover based on Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). The master device sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets to a multicast address, and if these packets are not received within a specified time, the slave device takes over. Both devices must be on the same subnet and share the same HA group identifier. Configuration for the master and slave units involves setting a virtual IP (VIP) as the default gateway for LAN hosts, enabling Configuration Sync for automatic updates, and ensuring both devices are connected to the Internet in the same mode (NAT or Drop-in). The failover process typically takes 10-15 seconds, during which WAN connections are re-established by the new master unit.\n\n## Document_9\n\nFor setting up High Availability (HA) with Peplink Balance devices or MAX 700/HD, it is essential to have a pair of devices operating in active-standby mode, utilizing Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) for failover. The master device sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets, and the slave device takes over when these packets are not received within a specified time. Both devices must be on the same subnet and share a unique HA group identifier. Configuration involves setting up a virtual IP address (VIP) as the default gateway for LAN hosts, and separate Ethernet switches are recommended to avoid a single point of failure. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave unit to automatically apply changes from the master unit, or it can be configured manually. The failover process typically takes 10-15 seconds, and both devices should be connected to the Internet in the same mode, either NAT or Drop-in mode, with the VIP set as the default gateway for connected hosts.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo implement a 1+1 Backup with Peplink Balance devices or MAX 700/HD in active-standby mode, both devices must be configured to support High Availability (HA) failover using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). The master device sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets to specific multicast addresses, and the slave device takes over if these packets are not received within a defined time interval. The devices must be on the same subnet and share the same HA group identifier. Configuration involves setting a virtual IP (VIP) as the default gateway for LAN hosts, and additional Ethernet switches are recommended to prevent single points of failure. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave unit to automatically apply changes from the master unit, or it can be configured manually. Failover typically occurs within 10-15 seconds, and both units should be connected to the Internet in the same mode, either NAT or Drop-in mode.\n\n## Document_11\n\nHigh Availability (HA) failover is supported on the Peplink MAX BR1 starting from Firmware 7, allowing a slave unit to take over the role of a master unit in case of failure, providing hardware redundancy. HA failover utilizes the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), where a heartbeat is sent from the master to the slave device. Both BR1 routers must be connected to the same LAN for VRRP to function, and they can use separate cellular WAN connections. Configuration requires setting the same HA group number on both devices, defining a Virtual IP address that serves as the default gateway for the LAN, and assigning additional IP addresses to each router. The configuration process involves logging into the master device, enabling HA, and applying the settings, followed by configuring the slave device to synchronize settings with the master.\n\n## Document_12\n\nHigh availability mode on Peplink routers, also known as Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), allows for seamless failover between two routers configured in master and slave mode. In this setup, one router (the master) handles all connectivity, while the other (the slave) remains on standby. If the master router experiences a failure, the slave router automatically takes over within approximately 15 seconds, ensuring continuous internet connectivity. The demonstration involved two Peplink Balance 380 routers, with an active ping to Google's public DNS to monitor connectivity. When the master router was turned off, the pings stopped, but once the slave router assumed master status, the pings resumed, demonstrating the effectiveness of the high availability setup. The process also includes the ability for the master router to regain control once it is powered back on, reverting the roles of the routers accordingly.\n\n## Document_13\n\nHigh Availability (HA) mode, also known as HA mode, provides hardware redundancy by allowing a slave unit to take over the role of a master unit in the event of a failure. This failover mechanism is based on the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), which sends a heartbeat signal from the master device to the slave device. If the heartbeat is lost due to hardware failure or disconnection, the slave unit assumes the master role. The setup involves configuring two Peplink Balance 20X devices, where the master device is set up first by enabling HA mode, selecting the master role, and configuring a virtual IP address that serves as the default gateway for connected hosts. The slave device is then configured to sync its settings with the master either automatically or manually, ensuring it has a different LAN IP address. The failover process typically takes 10 to 15 seconds, during which all line connections are re-established. Successful configuration can be verified through the web admin dashboard of the slave device, which will indicate that HA mode is enabled.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe high availability feature of the Peplink Balance 20X can cause issues with cable modems, particularly those from Comcast, due to the changing of the Ethernet MAC address on the WAN port. This can lead to the modem becoming unresponsive, as it is sensitive to MAC address changes. The MAC address used during high availability is an unassigned IANA MAC address (00:00:5e:01:01:fa), which is not appropriate for this function. The expected virtual MAC address for VRRP should be 00:00:5e:00:01:fa. When high availability is enabled, the WAN port may show a private IP address instead of the public IP, and the WAN status may indicate down due to DNS test failures, suggesting that the modem is not passing traffic from the router.

      "Peplink's high availability (HA) feature operates on a master/slave architecture, where one router is designated as the master and the other as a backup. The backup router remains inactive while the master is operational, only becoming active if the master fails. This implementation does not support a peer-to-peer relationship where both routers can independently manage their own WANs and VLANs while providing backup for each other. The HA configuration requires synchronization of settings between the master and slave, which is optional but necessary for the slave to be prepared for activation in case of a master failure. If synchronization is not enabled, the slave must be manually configured to match the master.",

If the master router experiences a failure, the slave router automatically takes over within approximately 15 seconds, ensuring continuous internet connectivity. The demonstration involved two Peplink Balance 380 routers, with an active ping to Google's public DNS to monitor connectivity. When the master router was turned off, the pings stopped, but once the slave router assumed master status, the pings resumed, demonstrating the effectiveness of the high availability setup.

    "query": "How does Peplink's High Availability (HA) implementation using VRRP work for LAN and WAN failover in a 1+1 Backup configuration, and what are the critical configuration requirements and limitations when using models like Balance 210 and 20X?",
    "answer": "Peplink's High Availability (HA) uses a master/slave (active-standby) architecture based on the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). In a 1+1 Backup configuration, the master router handles all traffic and sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets on the LAN to a multicast address. The slave router monitors these packets and, if they stop (indicating master failure), the slave takes over within 10–15 seconds. For LAN failover, a Virtual IP (VIP) is configured on the same subnet as both routers, serving as the default gateway for LAN hosts. For WAN failover, in NAT mode, VRRP enables the slave to assume the master’s WAN IP address, requiring only one public IP address for the HA pair. Both routers must share the same HA group identifier and be on the same subnet. Configuration Sync can automate the settings transfer from master to slave, or manual configuration can be used. For best reliability, separate Ethernet switches are recommended to avoid single points of failure. On models like Balance 20X, limitations include only being master/backup for one network and potential issues with cable modems due to use of an inappropriate virtual MAC address, which can cause WAN connectivity problems with some ISPs. The VRRP virtual MAC address used may not conform to expectations, leading to the WAN port showing a private IP instead of the public IP, and packet captures may yield LAN rather than WAN traffic during failover events.",

HA failover utilizes the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), where a heartbeat is sent from the master to the slave device. Both BR1 routers must be connected to the same LAN for VRRP to function, and they can use separate cellular WAN connections. Configuration requires setting the same HA group number on both devices, defining a Virtual IP address that serves as the default gateway for the LAN, and assigning additional IP addresses to each router.

In this setup, one router (the master) handles all connectivity, while the other (the slave) remains on standby. If the master router experiences a failure, the slave router automatically takes over within approximately 15 seconds, ensuring continuous internet connectivity. The demonstration involved two Peplink Balance 380 routers, with an active ping to Google's public DNS to monitor connectivity. When the master router was turned off, the pings stopped, but once the slave router assumed master status, the pings resumed, demonstrating the effectiveness of the high availability setup. The process also includes the ability for the master router to regain control once it is powered back on, reverting the roles of the routers accordingly.\n\n## Document_13\n\nHigh Availability (HA) mode, also known as HA mode, provides hardware redundancy by allowing a slave unit to take over the role of a master unit in the event of a failure. This failover mechanism is based on the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), which sends a heartbeat signal from the master device to the slave device. If the heartbeat is lost due to hardware failure or disconnection, the slave unit assumes the master role. The setup involves configuring two Peplink Balance 20X devices, where the master device is set up first by enabling HA mode, selecting the master role, and configuring a virtual IP address that serves as the default gateway for connected hosts. The slave device is then configured to sync its settings with the master either automatically or manually, ensuring it has a different LAN IP address. The failover process typically takes 10 to 15 seconds, during which all line connections are re-established. Successful configuration can be verified through the web admin dashboard of the slave device, which will indicate that HA mode is enabled.\n\n## Document_14\n\nIn a high availability (HA) setup using Peplink Balance routers in NAT mode, VRRP is utilized for WAN as well as LAN configurations. When properly configured, VRRP allows for the transfer of WAN addresses from the master router to the slave router in the event of a failure. This means that only one public IP address is needed for the HA setup, as the slave router will take over the master router's public IP address upon failure, rather than requiring multiple public IP addresses for each router.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Peplink Max HD4 can function as a backup router in a VRRP configuration alongside two other routers, where it can serve as the third backup router. However, the default VRRP priority for the HD4 is not specified, and it appears that the configuration does not allow for setting a specific priority value.

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nTo determine if an upgrade from the Peplink Balance 20 is necessary, users should monitor CPU usage and current bandwidth, as the Balance 20 has a throughput limit of 150Mbps. If CPU usage is frequently near maximum or if bandwidth often maxes out, an upgrade may be warranted. For optimal network management, especially with different user groups, implementing VLANs is recommended, as the mesh system in use should support VLANs. Peplink devices do not support mesh networking directly but can utilize a device connector for WiFi extension, which also supports VLANs.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a throughput speed that can vary between 100 Mbps and 150 Mbps, which may depend on factors such as firmware or hardware configurations. To verify the actual throughput speed, it is recommended to test the connection directly to the WAN using a PC, rather than through a gigabit rated switch.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 is suitable for small business use with up to 25 users, but the recommended user count is a guideline rather than a strict limit. Important factors to monitor include the throughput rating, which should be compared to the actual traffic load, and potential performance issues such as slow speeds or high CPU load if the device is stressed. The Balance 20 supports two WAN connections and has a throughput of 100Mbps, which is adequate given the current upstream speeds of 10Mbps and 25Mbps. Features like SpeedFusion and VPN are not required for this setup, and the user is not segmenting traffic or using advanced QoS settings.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Balance 20 router has a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, which can be exceeded by a 500Mbps WAN connection, potentially leading to performance issues such as high CPU usage and unresponsiveness during large downloads. Users have reported that actual throughput under real-world conditions can be significantly lower than the advertised specifications, with some suggesting that actual throughput may be about one-third of the raw throughput under ideal conditions. In contrast, other Peplink devices, like the Balance 20X, can achieve higher throughput, with reports of 900+ Mbps on 1Gbps fiber connections.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a throughput of 150Mbps, which is less than the combined total of the user's WAN connections (100/5M, 150/6M, and 35/5M). For users with 20-30 connections, particularly for applications like Zoom, upgrading to a Peplink Balance 305 is recommended due to its higher capacity and performance, supporting up to 1Gbps throughput. Alternatively, the Balance 210 with an additional license can provide a maximum throughput of 350Mbps, but it is not as capable as the Balance 305.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 supports only basic PepVPN functionality, which may limit the ability to use multiple WAN connections for PepVPN. In contrast, other models allow for advanced features such as WAN smoothing for data redundancy or WAN bonding for higher throughput, which are not available on the Balance 20.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 differs from higher tier models primarily in the number of recommended users it supports, routing throughput, and advanced features such as inbound load-balancing and SpeedFusion, which may not be relevant for basic load balancing needs. Performance increases from using a Peplink Balance device may not be observed with a VPN client, as the performance is dependent on the behavior of the traffic rather than the hardware used.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a bandwidth limit of 100 Mbps, which may be a concern if WAN speeds increase significantly beyond current levels. It does not offer user or group bandwidth limitations, which means it cannot allocate minimum bandwidth for specific users or servers. The device can handle two WAN connections, one with two static IP addresses and another as a DHCP device, allowing for proper routing to separate LAN devices. However, the new firmware version 6.1 for Peplink 20 and 30 provides PepVPN but does not support SpeedFusion for bonding connections.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 allows for the combination of multiple WAN connections to enhance network performance, providing significant improvements in download and upload speeds. However, the User Groups Bandwidth Control feature, which would allow for individual bandwidth limits for users based on IP or MAC address, is only available in higher models of the Balance series. Users can utilize outbound policy settings to manage traffic, but this may not provide the desired level of control for prioritizing or limiting specific users' bandwidth effectively.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 allows for the combination of multiple WAN connections to enhance network performance, providing significant improvements in download and upload speeds. However, the ability to set individual bandwidth limits for users via IP or MAC address is not available on the Balance 20, as this feature is reserved for higher-end Enterprise class models. The user has updated to the latest firmware version 5.4.9 build 1732.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a router throughput rating of 100 Mbps, which is a limiting factor for the maximum speed experienced when connected through the device. The Balance 20 features 4 Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) LAN ports, but the overall throughput is determined by the router's specifications. Users should consider the total throughput by adding the upload and download speeds of all WAN connections to understand performance limitations.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 device has a maximum throughput rating of 20Mbps, which may limit speeds when connected to a higher-speed internet service. The newer model of the Balance 20, which features a metal enclosure, is rated for up to 100Mbps throughput, indicating that upgrading to this newer model could resolve speed limitations experienced with the older version.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a router throughput rating of 100 Mbps, which is sufficient for the combined bandwidth of the user's Comcast and Century Link DSL connections, totaling slightly over 50 Mbps. The device can support 1-25 LAN clients, making it suitable for the anticipated growth to 21 clients (9 VoIP lines and 12 computers). The primary bottleneck in this setup is likely the Century Link DSL connection, especially considering the daily internet traffic of 2-3 GB, which is manageable given the available bandwidth. The Balance 20 should continue to perform well under the current and projected usage, with the option to upgrade later if necessary.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 is capable of handling internet speeds up to 100Mbps, making it suitable for home or small office use. It is recommended as a newer model to replace the older Balance Plus unit, which may not support faster internet speeds.\n\n## Document_15\n\nFor configuring a Peplink Balance 20 with eero Pros, it is suggested to use double NAT to retain eero functionality such as parental controls, while setting the eero WAN to DHCP for IP assignment from the Balance 20. This configuration allows for enhanced security features from the Peplink device, including content blocking and VLAN support, although eero does not support VLANs. The Balance 20's throughput of 150 Mbps is generally sufficient for 20-30 users, with typical Zoom calls consuming 2-4 Mbps each, but attention should be paid to upload bandwidth. For higher throughput needs, the Balance 20X offers 900 Mbps but has only one WAN port, while the Balance One or Balance Two provide multiple WAN ports at a higher price point.\n\n## Document_16\n\nFor configuring a Peplink Balance 20 with eero Pros, users can choose between Double NAT or bridge mode, depending on their preference for utilizing eero features. The Balance 20 has a throughput of 150 Mbps, which may be less than the combined total of multiple WAN connections. For environments with 20-30 users, especially those using bandwidth-intensive applications like Zoom, it may be advisable to consider upgrading to a different Peplink model to accommodate higher throughput needs.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe throughput speed of the Peplink Balance 20 is dependent on the hardware revision and the firmware version. The current model supports a throughput of 150 Mbps when on the latest firmware.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe throughput speed of the Peplink Balance 20 can be either 100 Mbps or 150 Mbps, which may depend on the specific hardware version or firmware. The R6 model is expected to achieve the higher throughput of 150 Mbps.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe Balance 20 router has a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, which can be exceeded by a 500Mbps WAN connection. When a large file download occurs, it can consume all of the router's resources, leading to unresponsiveness and high CPU usage, which is expected behavior for this model. The Balance 20 may not handle high traffic volumes gracefully, and it is suggested that a more capable device, such as the Balance 20X, would be better suited for handling multiple simultaneous activities without performance degradation.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe Balance 20 router may struggle with high bandwidth connections, such as a 500Mb/sec WAN, leading to performance issues like high CPU usage and unresponsiveness during large downloads. To mitigate this, it is recommended to set the Upload Bandwidth setting for the fiber connection to 120 Mbps to throttle the WAN interface. Additionally, implementing group bandwidth limits can help manage download rates on the client side.\n\n## Document_21\n\nThe Balance 20 router may experience performance issues such as unresponsiveness and high CPU usage during large file downloads, potentially due to Bufferbloat. While Peplink has implemented fq_codel for uploads under the Mitigate Bufferbloat setting, it currently does not support downloads, with a fix expected in version 9. Users can enable the 'DSL cable optimization' feature to prioritize certain types of traffic, which may help improve Bufferbloat performance until the download support is available.\n\n## Document_22\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 is undersized for applications involving 20-30 users, particularly with high-demand activities like Zoom calls. For improved performance, it is recommended to consider upgrading to a Peplink Balance One, Balance 210 (with the 3rd WAN port activated), or Balance 305. Engaging a Peplink Partner for tailored recommendations based on specific needs is also advised.\n\n## Document_23\n\nIn a Peplink Balance 20 setup with two active WAN links, one using PPPoE and the other using DHCP, if PepVPN is set to prefer WAN2 but shows it as unavailable while both WANs are connected in the Dashboard, it indicates a configuration issue. To ensure PepVPN exits only over WAN2, specific settings may need to be adjusted, although the exact settings are not detailed in the conversation.\n\n## Document_24\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a bandwidth limit of 100 Mbps, which may be a concern if WAN speeds increase significantly in the future. The device supports PePVPN in the new 6.1 firmware, providing session persistence but lacking WAN aggregation features found in SpeedFusion. The Balance 20 does not offer user or group bandwidth limitations, which may be a drawback for users needing to allocate minimum bandwidth to specific devices. Additionally, the Balance 20 can handle two WAN connections, one with two static IP addresses and another with a dynamic IP, ensuring proper routing to separate LAN devices.\n\n",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nThe Balance ONE and CORE models from Peplink support throughput of up to 600Mbps, which is reduced to 400Mbps when using five WAN connections. These models have been successfully used with 1Gbps/200Mbps links for three years without issues.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe Peplink Balance 30 does not have a limit on the number of SIP endpoints that can be registered. If there are issues with registering more than 20 endpoints, it is recommended to capture a diagnostic report from the Balance while the issue occurs and submit it for support review.\n\n## Document_3\n\nFor users experiencing performance issues with the Pepwave Balance One, particularly when utilizing the 5-WAN upgrade, it is important to note that the throughput is limited to 400Mbps. To achieve better performance while supporting multiple WAN connections, a recommended setup includes the Balance 20X with a FlexModule Mini for additional cellular connections and a Transit Duo or HD2 for further cellular WANs. This architecture allows for a total throughput of 1 Gbps, with options for various cellular modems. Additionally, for redundancy and reliability, deploying a second Balance 20X in high availability mode is advisable, ensuring quick failover and connection retention.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Peplink Balance 380 can handle up to 500 users and up to 75,000 simultaneous sessions without any hard limit. This information is relevant for assessing network performance and managing latency issues.\n\n## Document_5\n\nFor a site with multiple WAN connections, if the current Pepwave Balance One is limited to 600Mbps throughput and 450Mbps with more than three WANs, users may consider upgrading to higher models in the product line. The next models include the Balance 305 with 1Gbps, Balance 580 with 1.5Gbps, Balance 710 with 2.5Gbps, Balance 1350 with 5Gbps, and Balance 2500 with 8Gbps throughput. It is important to assess actual bandwidth needs to determine if an upgrade is necessary.\n\n## Document_6\n\nIn a drop-in mode deployment of the PepLink Balance 380, the DHCP Server settings will be overwritten. Typically, a firewall with public IPs is positioned on the inside of the Balance, and DHCP is managed on the inside of the firewall.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe Peplink Balance One has a router throughput of 400 mb/s, which refers to the combined total throughput of all WAN connections in Load Balance mode. Therefore, it cannot achieve a maximum download speed of 525 mb/s with three 175 mb/s connections. For achieving higher speeds, the Peplink Balance 305 is recommended as it can support the necessary throughput for three WAN connections.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe Peplink Balance One has a maximum throughput of 400 mb/s when using three WAN connections in Load Balance mode, meaning that the combined download speeds will not exceed this limit. To achieve a total download speed of 525 mb/s with three 175 mbps connections, a more robust solution would be required, such as using two Balance One Core units to aggregate bandwidth effectively. This setup involves connecting two WANs to one Balance Core unit and the third WAN to another Balance Core unit, allowing for better management of the aggregated bandwidth.\n\n## Document_9\n\nFor achieving a throughput of 400 Mbps with two WAN lines of 200 Mbps each, the Peplink Balance One is suitable for environments with fewer than 60 users, while the Balance 305 or higher models are recommended for more than 60 users.\n\n## Document_10\n\nFor a small co-op WISP using Peplink, the Balance One is suitable for 1-60 users, but the Balance 305 is recommended for deployments with potential growth beyond that. The throughput ratings for Peplink devices are based on the total upload and download speeds across all WAN connections, which is important to consider if both WANs are used simultaneously or if bandwidth needs increase in the future. The Peplink software allows for VLAN configurations and NAT for static public IP assignments, although specific static IP assignments to VLANs may not be directly visible in the software.\n\n## Document_11\n\nFor load balancing and failover of two 15Mb DSL connections with 15 users and 50 devices including VoIP and VPN support, the PepLink Balance 030 may not be adequate as it is recommended for up to 25 simultaneous users/devices. The Balance One is suggested as a more suitable option for this configuration.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe Peplink Balance 380 is rated for up to 500 concurrent users, making it a more powerful device compared to the Balance One, which supports up to 50 concurrent users. Despite being an older model, the 380 has significantly higher data capacity and processing power than the Balance One.\n\n## Document_13\n\nWhen considering a Peplink Balance router for a network of about 80 users, the Balance One is rated for 1Gbps throughput but recommended for only up to 50 users. The Balance 305 is the least expensive model rated for the required number of users, with a throughput of 200Mbps, which is close to the current 150Mbps internet connection. Key factors for sizing include the number of WAN links, available WAN bandwidth, SpeedFusion VPN usage, and the type of traffic over SpeedFusion. The Balance One can handle a high number of concurrent sessions, tested up to 5000, but lacks some enterprise features found in higher models like the Balance 305 and 380, which include hardware high availability support, advanced AP controller functionality, and QoS user groups.\n\n## Document_14\n\nWhen sizing for the right Peplink Balance model, it is important to consider the number of users on the network, as this correlates to the number of concurrent sessions. Smaller units have fewer hardware resources compared to larger units, which can impact performance based on user load.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe user is experiencing limited wireless bandwidth, with no device exceeding 5Mbps download speed despite having a 32Mbps line and a 5Mbps fiber line connected through a Peplink Balance 310. The setup is in bridge mode, and the user has tested the connection directly through the ATT 32Mbps router, achieving a maximum of 6Mbps. The office environment is large and contains many walls, which may impact wireless signal strength and speed.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe Peplink B One series supports a 1 Gbps throughput and is suitable for small businesses, but certain features like RADIUS and LDAP authentication for VPN are only available in higher-end models such as the Balance 210 and above. Users have reported issues with the accuracy of product specifications, as features listed in manuals and datasheets may not be available in the actual devices. The Balance 310 5G Fiber model is recommended for normal business use due to its ability to handle a full 1 Gbps fiber connection with all features enabled. Users have experienced stability issues with firmware versions, particularly with the Balance 310, which requires specific firmware to avoid frequent lockups. Additionally, using AWS EC2 for hosting FusionHub is suggested as a better alternative to Vultr due to networking issues.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 and 30 routers are limited to approximately 200mb throughput, which creates a bottleneck for users in areas where gigabit download speeds are being rolled out. The current lineup of Peplink routers does not support gigabit throughput until the 300 series and higher. This limitation affects small business and residential users who expect to utilize gigabit service without significant speed loss, as they may experience a 40% drop in speed when using these routers.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Peplink Balance One has a router throughput of 400 mb/s when using three WAN connections in Load Balance mode, meaning that the maximum combined download speed achievable is 400 mb/s, not the sum of the individual WAN speeds (525 mb/s). To achieve higher speeds, one option is to use a second dual-WAN router to create additional WAN interfaces, allowing for a total of four WAN connections, although one would be used to route traffic between the two routers.\n\n## Document_19\n\nFor achieving a throughput of 400 Mbps with two WAN lines of 200 Mbps each, the Peplink Balance One model is recommended for home use. The country of manufacture for Peplink devices is not specified in the conversation.\n\n## Document_20\n\nIn a setup with a Peplink Balance 310 and multiple access points, if wireless devices are experiencing limited download speeds (e.g., 5Mbps), it is important to check for potential issues such as Wi-Fi congestion on the 2.4GHz band. Utilizing Wi-Fi channel analyzers can help identify congestion. Additionally, running simultaneous speed tests on multiple devices may provide insight into bandwidth distribution and performance.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo troubleshoot low wireless speeds when using a Peplink Balance 310 with a 32Mbps ATT WAN, it is recommended to connect a laptop directly to the WAN for a speed test, and then connect the WAN to an AP One and test again with the same laptop. This will help measure the effective bandwidth available over Wi-Fi. It is noted that Wi-Fi performance may yield lower speeds due to environmental factors such as walls and the layout of the office space.\n\n",

    "query": "How have past InControl maintenance events and system overloads led to changes in cluster upgrade procedures and offline device handling, and what evidence supports these changes?",
    "answer": "Previous InControl maintenance events, such as the one on 24 May 2023, caused system overloads when a maintenance fix was deployed to all InControl “planets” at once. This resulted in devices being incorrectly marked as offline due to the device communication cluster’s inability to process the high volume of re-authentication requests. To address this, changes were made to deploy fixes to only one planet at a time and to add resources to the communication cluster. Additionally, the system was updated to stop marking devices as offline during periods of high authentication volume, preventing false alarms. Previous overloads, such as the January 2, 2024 incident, similarly led to devices being falsely marked offline due to system component overloads, highlighting the need for these procedural changes.",

Additionally, Peplink routers support outbound policies for data transfer management, content filtering, application blocking, and include a warranty option called 'Peplink Care' for hardware and technical support.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe Pepwave Balance 20X can utilize a USB Ethernet dongle as a second WAN port, allowing for additional connectivity options. With SpeedFusion, it is possible to create a profile with multiple sub-tunnels for different traffic types; one for per-packet bonding for TCP traffic and another for routing UDP traffic based on the lowest round-trip time (RTT). The support.cgi page can be used to access settings for traffic distribution profiles. Additionally, IPv6 can be tunneled over IPv4 using a 6in4 tunnel, which can be configured to forward protocol 41 to an IP behind the SpeedFusion VPN, facilitating IPv6 connectivity.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe Pepwave Balance 20X has one WAN port, and while it is suggested that a USB Ethernet adapter could be used as a second WAN connection, there is no official confirmation or support for this in the device's manual. The performance of USB Ethernet adapters may vary, and it is unclear if any specific adapters are compatible with the Balance 20X. Additionally, the user is interested in utilizing SpeedFusion for bonding multiple VDSL2 lines to improve TCP traffic handling and to prefer the line with the lowest RTT for UDP traffic, while also considering IPv6 tunneling over IPv4.\n\n## Document_18\n\nTo set up a Pepwave Balance 20X for bonding two VDSL2 lines, it is possible to use a USB Ethernet adapter as WAN2, although the Balance 20X has only one WAN port. For IPv6 connectivity, a tunnel can be established using HE.net's 6in4 service, with the Balance 20 configured to tunnel all traffic via a FusionHub. A port forward for IP Protocol 41 is necessary to allow IPv6 traffic to reach the firewall behind the Balance 20. However, SpeedFusion bonding is not available on the Balance 20 without a specific license, and the performance of the IPv6 tunnel has not been tested in this setup.\n\n## Document_19\n\nFor users looking to bond multiple VDSL2 lines while minimizing latency issues, the Pepwave Balance 20X can utilize a USB Ethernet adapter as a second WAN port. This setup allows for the use of both lines via SpeedFusion tunneling, which can help manage TCP traffic effectively. For UDP traffic, it is suggested to prefer the line with the lowest round-trip time (RTT) while still using the tunnel to maintain a consistent source IP. Additionally, the Balance 30 PRO LTE is mentioned as an alternative with two WAN ports and cellular support, which may provide a better solution for such setups.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe Balance 20 supports Dual-WAN connectivity with seamless switching between two WAN links, while the Balance 20X features 1 Ethernet WAN, 1 Embedded LTE Modem, 1 USB Interface, and 1 FlexModul Mini slot. The Balance 20 does not include Wi-Fi to comply with strict security standards, whereas the Balance 20X supports dual-band Wi-Fi (2.4GHz and 5GHz) for enhanced flexibility and reduced interference. In terms of throughput, the Balance 20 has a maximum throughput of 150 Mbps, while the Balance 20X offers a routing throughput of 900 Mbps, making both suitable for small businesses and branches. Additionally, the Balance 20X PrimeCare model includes InControl, Warranty, SpeedFusion license upgrades, and FusionHub Licenses as part of a subscription service.\n\n## Document_21\n\nIn a PepLink B One deployment with two ISPs, one cable/fiber and the other 5G LTE, it is possible to achieve effective load balancing and failover without using SpeedFusion Connect (SFC). The default failover and load balancing features can provide satisfactory performance, as demonstrated by quick recovery times during outages. However, SFC is typically used for traffic that requires reliability, such as VoIP or site-to-site connections, rather than for increasing bandwidth. Using SFC introduces overhead (18-36%) and can significantly reduce throughput, especially when additional features like content filtering or QoS are enabled. For optimal performance, especially with high bandwidth connections, using higher capacity PepLink devices is advisable.\n\n## Document_22\n\nIn a deployment scenario with a PepLink B One using two ISPs, one being a cable/fiber provider with 100/100 Mbps and the other a 5G LTE connection with 250/20 Mbps, it is possible to configure the internet sources without SpeedFusion Connect (SFC) and still achieve optimal performance. Speed tests can show faster download speeds from the LTE connection and better upload speeds from the fiber connection. Outbound VoIP calls can recover quickly from ISP failures without SFC, suggesting that SFC may not be necessary for all use cases. However, experiences with SFC indicate that it can negatively impact performance if one of the connections is significantly slower, as it may prioritize redundancy over speed, potentially dragging down overall performance.\n\n",

      "In a PepLink B One deployment with two ISPs, one cable/fiber and the other 5G LTE, it is possible to achieve effective load balancing and failover without using SpeedFusion Connect (SFC). The default failover and load balancing features can provide satisfactory performance, as demonstrated by quick recovery times during outages. However, SFC is typically used for traffic that requires reliability, such as VoIP or site-to-site connections, rather than for increasing bandwidth. Using SFC introduces overhead (18-36%) and can significantly reduce throughput, especially when additional features like content filtering or QoS are enabled. For optimal performance, especially with high bandwidth connections, using higher capacity PepLink devices is advisable.",
      "In a deployment scenario with a PepLink B One using two ISPs, one being a cable/fiber provider with 100/100 Mbps and the other a 5G LTE connection with 250/20 Mbps, it is possible to configure the internet sources without SpeedFusion Connect (SFC) and still achieve optimal performance. Speed tests can show faster download speeds from the LTE connection and better upload speeds from the fiber connection. Outbound VoIP calls can recover quickly from ISP failures without SFC, suggesting that SFC may not be necessary for all use cases. However, experiences with SFC indicate that it can negatively impact performance if one of the connections is significantly slower, as it may prioritize redundancy over speed, potentially dragging down overall performance."

    "query": "How can a Pepwave Balance 20X be configured to bond two VDSL2 lines for both TCP and UDP traffic, and what are the considerations for WAN port expansion and IPv6 support in this scenario?",
    "answer": "To bond two VDSL2 lines on a Pepwave Balance 20X, you can use a USB Ethernet adapter as a second WAN port (WAN2) in addition to the built-in Ethernet WAN. Once both WAN ports are connected to VDSL2 lines, SpeedFusion bonding can be configured to aggregate the lines. For TCP traffic, set up a SpeedFusion profile that enables per-packet bonding to maximize throughput and reliability. For UDP traffic, configure the profile to prefer the WAN with the lowest round-trip time (RTT) while still using the tunnel to maintain a consistent source IP. For IPv6 connectivity, you can establish a 6in4 tunnel (e.g., via HE.net) and forward protocol 41 through SpeedFusion to the appropriate device behind the firewall. Note that while using a USB Ethernet adapter is common in practice, there is no explicit official confirmation of support or compatibility for all adapters, so results may vary. Additionally, all SpeedFusion features (such as bonding) require the appropriate license (PrimeCare).",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nWhen using Peplink Balance routers with Content Filtering enabled, blocking the Security/Tunneling protocol of IPSec can interfere with Wi-Fi Calling functionality, as Wi-Fi Calling requires this protocol. The Exempted Domain feature in Web Blocking does not exempt IPSec application blocking, which may lead to issues with Wi-Fi Calling. Users experiencing this problem are advised to open a support ticket for further assistance and investigation into the conditions under which the Wi-Fi Calling application is blocked.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe MediaFast 500 supports all 8 load balancing algorithms, contrary to the initial impression that it only supports 7. This indicates that the specifications for the MediaFast family may not be fully representative of its capabilities regarding load balancing algorithms.\n\n## Document_3\n\nTo create a VPN connection between two Peplink units, specifically the BPL 305 and BPL 310, users can refer to the Balance and MediaFast User Manual for Firmware 7, which is available for download on the Peplink website under the Support section.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Peplink Balance 700, released in 2006, is considered outdated and should be replaced for security reasons. If one chooses to keep it, the minimum recommended firmware version is 6.3.4, which requires upgrading through several intermediate versions: 5.0, 5.3.12, and 5.4.9 before reaching 6.1.0 and finally 6.3.4. The firmware for version 5 is not publicly available and requires logging a support ticket to obtain.\n\n## Document_5\n\nIn a network configuration involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 routers connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is important to ensure that outbound rules are correctly set up for traffic to traverse from the satellite sites to Azure. The Balance 508 needs to properly advertise its routes to the connected 305 devices for successful end-to-end connectivity.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Peplink Balance 300, which is approximately 15 years old, supports a maximum throughput of 20Mbps. Therefore, if clients are experiencing a maximum speed of 15Mbps, this is within the expected performance limits of the device, despite having three WAN connections with a total potential speed of 300Mbps.\n\n## Document_7\n\nIn a drop-in mode deployment of the PepLink Balance 380, the DHCP Server settings will be overwritten. Typically, a firewall with public IPs is positioned on the inside of the Balance, and DHCP is managed on the inside of the firewall.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe default login credentials for the Peplink Balance 1 router are username 'admin' and password 'admin'.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe latest firmware for the Peplink Balance 20W is v4.8.1, and this model has been obsoleted. Users are advised to consider refreshing their router for updated features and support.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe firmware for the Peplink Balance 50 is the same as that for the Balance 20 and Balance 30. The correct firmware version 7.0.0 can be downloaded from the URL https://download.peplink.com/firmware/plb30/fw-b20_30-7.0.0-build3310.bin. There was an error in the URL for the firmware on the Peplink website, and the firmware for version 6.3.3 also contains incorrect links. The best representation of firmware for these models is found in version 6.2.3, where the models have been consolidated into one button on the download page.\n\n## Document_11\n\nChanging the LAN IP address on a Peplink Balance 310 from 192.168.1.41 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (/24) to 192.168.1.41 with a subnet mask of 255.254.0.0 (/15) is not a valid configuration, as 192.168.x.x is a Class C network which supports a maximum of /24. For a /15 subnet mask, a Class A network configuration would be required.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo upgrade the firmware on a Peplink Balance 700 from version 4, the device must first be updated to version 4.8.2, then to 5.3.12, and finally to the highest version 5.4.9. Users are advised to open a support ticket for specific links and instructions regarding the firmware upgrade process.\n\n## Document_13\n\nFor load balancing and failover of two 15Mb DSL connections with 15 users and 50 devices including VoIP and VPN support, the PepLink Balance 030 may not be adequate as it is recommended for up to 25 simultaneous users/devices. The Balance One is suggested as a more suitable option for this configuration.\n\n## Document_14\n\nFor live streaming with increased bandwidth, the Pepwave MAX On-The-Go or MAX 700 are suitable mobile routers that provide more bandwidth through multiple sessions or streams and offer instant fail-over between USB modems. To bond multiple USB modems for a single stream, SpeedFusion VPN bonding technology is required, necessitating a second SpeedFusion-enabled device at the headquarters or data center, with the Peplink Balance 380 being a recommended choice for this purpose.\n\n## Document_15\n\nTo troubleshoot low wireless speeds when using a Peplink Balance 310 with a 32Mbps ATT WAN, it is recommended to connect a laptop directly to the WAN for a speed test, and then connect the WAN to an AP One and test again with the same laptop. This will help measure the effective bandwidth available over Wi-Fi. It is noted that Wi-Fi performance may yield lower speeds due to environmental factors such as walls and the layout of the office space.\n\n## Document_16\n\nIncontrol and InControl2 are distinct platforms, and there is currently no automated method for migrating devices from Incontrol to InControl2; the migration process must be performed manually.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo enable Wi-Fi Calling while blocking the IPSec tunneling protocol using Peplink Balance routers, it is necessary to utilize a new option for \"Exempted Domains from Application Blocking\" in the content filtering settings. Issues have been noted with firmware versions 7.1.2GA and 8.0.0RC4, and further testing is being conducted with firmware 8.0.1 RC4 to find a solution for maintaining Wi-Fi Calling functionality while restricting VPN traffic.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Balance MediaFast family of products supports 7 load balancing algorithms, while the BALANCE family supports 8. The missing algorithm is likely 'fastest response time', which was added most recently. However, it is also possible that the MediaFast reference and datasheets are outdated.\n\n## Document_19\n\nTo create a VPN connection between two Peplink units, such as the BPL 305 and BPL 310, it is important to refer to the user manual for detailed instructions. Additionally, if there is a router or firewall in front of the Peplink devices, port forwarding must be configured for the default protocols TCP 32015 and UDP 4500 to ensure proper connectivity.\n\n## Document_20\n\nIn a network configuration involving PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is noted that IP Sec tunnels do not typically advertise their routes through second hops. To enable connectivity from satellite sites to Azure, a static route for the Azure subnet can be added on the satellite devices, pointing to the Balance 508. Additionally, firewall configurations on both the satellite sites and Azure may need to be reviewed to ensure they allow the necessary traffic exchange.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo enable connectivity from PepLink Balance 305 devices to Azure through a Balance 508, static routes can be configured on the Balance 305 for the Azure subnet, using the Balance 508 as the gateway. Additionally, the Azure configuration should include a static route for the Balance 305 subnet, also using the Balance 508 as the gateway. It is important to ensure that firewall rules on both ends permit this routing to function correctly.\n\n## Document_22\n\nIn a network setup involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via a star topology, issues may arise with route advertisement to Azure through IP Sec VPN tunnels. The Balance 508 may not be advertising its routes to the connected Balance 305 devices, which can prevent satellite sites from accessing Azure. Additionally, static routes may need to connect to gateways within the same subnet, which can complicate configurations if sites are not willing to share a common subnet.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe outbound policy configuration on the PepLink Balance 508 was successfully adjusted, allowing the connected Balance 305 devices to traverse to Azure through the established IP Sec VPN tunnels. This indicates that proper routing and policy settings are essential for enabling connectivity between satellite sites and Azure.\n\n## Document_24\n\nThe Balance 300 router supports a maximum throughput of 20mbps per user, despite having three WAN connections each capable of 100mbps. This means that while the total potential speed from the WAN connections is 300mbps, the router's limitations restrict the actual usable speed to 20mbps per user, indicating that the additional bandwidth from the WAN connections is not utilized effectively.\n\n## Document_25\n\nTo achieve better bandwidth for live streaming, using a Pepwave Max On-The-Go 3G/4G Router with Load Balancing and SpeedFusion is recommended. The traffic should be routed across the SpeedFusion VPN tunnel to a Peplink device located at a headquarters or datacenter, which will then connect to streaming services like Dacast or Livestream.\n\n## Document_26\n\nFor live streaming business requiring more bandwidth than a single USB modem can provide, a balancing and bonding router is recommended. The Pepwave Max On-The-Go 3G/4G Router with Load Balancing and SpeedFusion technology is suitable for achieving throughput of 35 to 50 Mbps. Further information can be found in the provided article link.\n\n## Document_27\n\nIn a setup with a Peplink Balance 310 and multiple access points, if wireless devices are experiencing limited download speeds (e.g., 5Mbps), it is important to check for potential issues such as Wi-Fi congestion on the 2.4GHz band. Utilizing Wi-Fi channel analyzers can help identify congestion. Additionally, running simultaneous speed tests on multiple devices may provide insight into bandwidth distribution and performance.\n\n## Document_28\n\nThe user is experiencing limited wireless bandwidth, with no device exceeding 5Mbps download speed despite having a 32Mbps line and a 5Mbps fiber line connected through a Peplink Balance 310. The setup is in bridge mode, and the user has tested the connection directly through the ATT 32Mbps router, achieving a maximum of 6Mbps. The office environment is large and contains many walls, which may impact wireless signal strength and speed.\n\n",

    "documents_text": "## Document_8\n\nWhen using a Pepwave Max Transit Duo with SpeedFusion bonding, individual cellular connections may perform adequately on their own, but bonding them can be challenging due to fluctuations in cellular speeds and packet sequencing issues. Users have reported difficulties achieving faster download speeds when bonding two cellular connections, although combining them for upload purposes may yield better results. Adjustments to settings such as MTU and WAN Connection Buffer Size have been attempted without significant improvement in overall speed. Additionally, streaming services may be blocked when using a VPN, complicating access for devices like Apple TV.\n\n## Document_9\n\nTo achieve great speed from two combined cellular connections on a Pepwave MBX Max Mini, it is recommended to use different SIMs from independent providers for each modem slot. Additionally, having spare SIMs in the secondary slots can provide alternatives. Setting up a FusionHub in a high-capacity data center like AWS and creating a SpeedFusion Tunnel from the exhibition router to the FusionHub can enhance connectivity. An outbound traffic rule should be established to direct traffic through the FusionHub. Upgrading antennas to models like the Pepwave Mobility 40G or Pepwave Maritime 40G is also advised for improved performance.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Pepwave Max BR1 Mk2 is a single modem, dual SIM device that allows users to manually select which SIM card to use or have the router automatically choose based on performance. Users can select options such as 'Both SIMs' or force the use of 'SIM A Only' or 'SIM B Only.' In contrast, devices with multiple modems, like the Transit Duo, allow each modem to be listed as a separate WAN connection, enabling users to drag and drop connections and select SIMs for each modem individually.\n\n## Document_11\n\nIn a recent test using the Pepwave MAX HD4 MBX 5G, it was found that the GPS functionality relies on a working cellular connection, specifically using the Cellular #1 chipset. If this connection is lost during flight, the GPS data cannot be recorded or captured, which poses a significant issue for data correlation with tested locations. This problem appears to have re-emerged in firmware version 8.1.2 GA, despite having been resolved in previous models and firmware updates. A Peplink ticket has been raised to address this issue.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo increase LAN internet speed on a Pepwave MAX HD4 MBX with multiple WAN and cellular connections, using load balancing mode allows a single LAN client or multiple clients to utilize the total available bandwidth. For a single session from one LAN device to leverage all available WANs simultaneously, SpeedFusion Bonding is required. A practical way to implement SpeedFusion bonding is by using a FusionHub hosted in Vultr for a monthly fee.\n\n## Document_13\n\nWhen using a Pepwave MAX-HD4 with SpeedFusion VPN, the performance of the bonding feature may result in lower speeds when multiple SIM cards are used compared to a single SIM card. This is due to the nature of cellular connections being bandwidth sharing, meaning the combined speeds of multiple SIMs do not equate to a simple sum of their individual speeds. Additionally, speed tests conducted between a PC and a speed test server do not accurately reflect the SpeedFusion throughput, which is a point-to-point connection between the HD4 and the Data Center Balance router. The drop in speed with multiple SIM cards may also be influenced by the connection quality between the two sites, such as high latency or packet loss on one of the cellular links.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo address disconnections from an ISP on a Max BR1 running v7.0.1 firmware, utilizing the SmartCheck feature can be beneficial. SmartCheck performs health checks on the cellular connection only when there is no active traffic, which helps maintain stability. If the connection goes idle, it will revert to using the DNS servers defined under the WAN Connection Settings.\n\n## Document_15\n\nWhen using two unlimited AT&T SIM cards in a Pepwave Max Transit Duo with SpeedFusion bonding, users may experience slower speeds than expected due to bandwidth sharing limitations at the cell tower. Testing individual SIM cards and comparing their speeds with a weighted balance outbound policy can help determine the available bandwidth from the location. It is common for bonded speeds to be worse than single connections due to overhead and the maximum available bandwidth to the FusionHub.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo optimize the performance of two AT&T connections on a Pepwave Max Transit Duo, it is recommended to use WAN Analysis to test each connection individually and then together, ensuring they are configured to use the same bands. If the connections do not show similar bandwidth figures when tested individually, it may indicate issues with the tower's handling of the connections. Additionally, the router allows for temporarily pausing a bond member connection based on latency thresholds, which can help improve bonding performance, although it may not fully resolve issues related to latency differences.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo set up SIM2 or CELLULAR 2 as an additional WAN connection on a Pepwave device, the dashboard allows for drag-and-drop selection of WAN connections. However, the command line interface (CLI) does not support switching between SIM cards; it is limited to configuring the APN. Alternatively, the device API could be utilized to create a custom application for easier management of SIM card selection.\n\n## Document_18\n\nIf experiencing disconnections with a new ISP on a Max BR1 running v7.0.1 firmware, it may be related to health-check issues or unreliable DNS servers. Testing with a different target for health checks could help resolve the disconnection problem.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe disconnections experienced with the new ISP, Tigo, on a Max BR1 running v7.0.1 firmware may be due to the carrier resetting the connection, likely caused by the assignment of a different IP address. The issue is not related to the router or signal strength, as it was functioning properly with the previous provider, Orange Senegal. Additionally, Dynamic DNS (DDNS) will not function correctly because the connection is receiving a private IP address instead of a public one.\n\n## Document_20\n\nWhen experiencing disconnections with a new ISP on a Max BR1 running v7.0.1 firmware, it is advisable to check with the carrier regarding the DHCP lease time, as a very short lease time could be causing the disconnections. The signal strength is not an issue, with an RSSI of -79dBm indicating a good connection.\n\n",

SmartCheck performs health checks on the cellular connection only when there is no active traffic, which helps maintain stability. If the connection goes idle, it will revert to using the DNS servers defined under the WAN Connection Settings.",
      "When using two unlimited AT&T SIM cards in a Pepwave Max Transit Duo with SpeedFusion bonding, users may experience slower speeds than expected due to bandwidth sharing limitations at the cell tower. Testing individual SIM cards and comparing their speeds with a weighted balance outbound policy can help determine the available bandwidth from the location. It is common for bonded speeds to be worse than single connections due to overhead and the maximum available bandwidth to the FusionHub.",
      "To optimize the performance of two AT&T connections on a Pepwave Max Transit Duo, it is recommended to use WAN Analysis to test each connection individually and then together, ensuring they are configured to use the same bands. If the connections do not show similar bandwidth figures when tested individually, it may indicate issues with the tower's handling of the connections. Additionally, the router allows for temporarily pausing a bond member connection based on latency thresholds, which can help improve bonding performance, although it may not fully resolve issues related to latency differences.",
      "To set up SIM2 or CELLULAR 2 as an additional WAN connection on a Pepwave device, the dashboard allows for drag-and-drop selection of WAN connections. However, the command line interface (CLI) does not support switching between SIM cards; it is limited to configuring the APN. Alternatively, the device API could be utilized to create a custom application for easier management of SIM card selection.",
      "If experiencing disconnections with a new ISP on a Max BR1 running v7.0.1 firmware, it may be related to health-check issues or unreliable DNS servers. Testing with a different target for health checks could help resolve the disconnection problem.",
      "The disconnections experienced with the new ISP, Tigo, on a Max BR1 running v7.0.1 firmware may be due to the carrier resetting the connection, likely caused by the assignment of a different IP address. The issue is not related to the router or signal strength, as it was functioning properly with the previous provider, Orange Senegal. Additionally, Dynamic DNS (DDNS) will not function correctly because the connection is receiving a private IP address instead of a public one.",
      "When experiencing disconnections with a new ISP on a Max BR1 running v7.0.1 firmware, it is advisable to check with the carrier regarding the DHCP lease time, as a very short lease time could be causing the disconnections. The signal strength is not an issue, with an RSSI of -79dBm indicating a good connection."

    "query": "Why do users often report that SpeedFusion bonding of two cellular connections on devices like the Pepwave Max Transit Duo results in lower or less predictable download speeds compared to using a single SIM, and what are some effective troubleshooting and optimization strategies?",
    "answer": "Users frequently find that SpeedFusion bonding of two cellular connections on devices like the Pepwave Max Transit Duo yields lower or less predictable download speeds compared to a single SIM due to several factors. Firstly, cellular connections are subject to bandwidth sharing at the tower, which can limit the actual combined throughput, especially when using two SIMs from the same provider. Bonding also introduces protocol overhead and packet sequencing challenges, which can further reduce effective speed. Differences in latency or quality between the two links can cause packet reordering and inefficiency in the bond. Additionally, the maximum bandwidth to the FusionHub endpoint and the connection quality between the Pepwave device and FusionHub (such as latency or packet loss) play a significant role. Users have tried adjusting settings like MTU and WAN Connection Buffer Size, but these rarely yield substantial improvements. Recommended troubleshooting steps include testing each SIM individually to assess their standalone performance and using WAN Analysis to ensure both are configured for similar bands and performance. Using SIMs from different providers and upgrading antennas can help, as can temporarily pausing one connection based on latency thresholds to improve bond quality. Outbound traffic rules and hosting the FusionHub in a high-capacity data center may further optimize results.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nFor site-to-site VPN configurations involving Peplink devices, using SpeedFusion VPN is recommended over traditional IPSec due to its ability to maintain VPN connections during WAN failures and to aggregate bandwidth from multiple WAN connections. SpeedFusion provides military-grade 256-bit AES encryption for data security and is noted for its ease of setup. The conversation also highlights issues with double NAT and private IP addresses in the context of VPN configurations, particularly with Cisco ASA and Peplink devices.\n\n## Document_2\n\nSpeedFusion Bandwidth Bonding can be used to combine the bandwidth of multiple WAN links, allowing one device behind the Peplink router to utilize the combined bandwidth of both connections, minus the bonding overhead. This technology can effectively increase overall throughput, as demonstrated by a user who combined two 15/1 DSL links to achieve a 25/1.5 connection, resulting in a noticeable improvement in performance.\n\n## Document_3\n\nSpeedFusion is a point-to-point VPN technology that requires at least two devices to create a bonded VPN using multiple WAN connections. Internet traffic can be routed in various ways: it can be load balanced directly to the internet using multiple WANs without utilizing SpeedFusion, or it can be sent over the SpeedFusion tunnel to access the internet through the remote device's internet connectivity.\n\n## Document_4\n\nSpeedFusion technology allows for the combination of multiple WAN connections to enhance internet speed and reliability. It operates on a hierarchy where PepVPN serves as the foundation, followed by SpeedFusion Hot Failover and then SpeedFusion Bonding. Traffic management approaches can be applied on top of bonding, including options such as Bonding, Lowest Latency, Weighted Round Robin, and Overflow. WAN Smoothing can be enabled to duplicate packets for reduced packet loss, consuming additional bandwidth. If WAN Smoothing is set to maximum, the SpeedFusion distribution algorithm is ignored, but at lower levels, duplicate packets are distributed according to the selected traffic distribution rules. In scenarios where the Lowest Latency distribution is used, SpeedFusion continuously selects the WAN with the lowest latency for outbound packets, adjusting as network conditions change.\n\n## Document_5\n\nSpeedFusion VPN is a suitable solution for aggregating multiple internet connections to enhance stability and reduce disconnects. It includes features such as Hot Failover, which automatically switches to another available connection during a failure, ensuring no downtime. WAN Smoothing addresses packet loss by sending extra packets that can be reconstructed, while also optimizing traffic to the connection with the lowest latency. Bandwidth Bonding combines multiple connections into a single high-speed connection, though it may not be necessary for all setups. It is important to note that SpeedFusion VPN requires Peplink devices on both ends of the tunnel for operation.\n\n## Document_6\n\nPeplink SpeedFusion technology allows for the bonding of multiple internet connections to provide a combined bandwidth, enhancing throughput and redundancy. It utilizes built-in VPN technology to achieve this, differentiating it from simple load balancing. To implement SpeedFusion, both ends of the connection must utilize Peplink devices, as SpeedFusion requires compatible hardware to function effectively. The proposed setup involves using a Peplink 710 in the main office with multiple ADSL connections and a Peplink Balance 20 at home or branch offices to achieve increased download speeds through bonded connections.\n\n## Document_7\n\nSpeedFusion creates a virtual tunnel that utilizes all WAN links simultaneously, providing an 'Unbreakable' VPN that does not require re-establishment upon the failure of an individual WAN connection. This results in increased throughput due to bandwidth bonding, which is not achievable with IPsec alone. The configuration includes 256-bit AES encryption and two Peplink Balance 380 routers with four 100Mbit/sec WAN links from two different ISPs, but performance may be limited due to factors not specified in the conversation.\n\n## Document_8\n\nPeplink SpeedFusion establishes concurrent VPN tunnels across multiple WAN connections, allowing for bonded bandwidth and instant failover. This technology distributes VPN traffic across these tunnels, maximizing available bandwidth. In the event of a WAN disconnection, the concurrent tunnels provide resilience by routing traffic through healthy connections, maintaining VPN sessions without downtime.

Additionally, it offers built-in dynamic routing capabilities, allowing users to route all traffic or only private network traffic through the VPN, enabling configurations such as star topology or mesh networks.\n\n## Document_9\n\nSpeedFusion is a VPN that allows for the combination of multiple connections for increased bandwidth, error correction, and traffic mirroring over multiple links. Data flows from the device to the Peplink router, then to the nearest SpeedFusion server and out to the work server, with returning data following the same path in reverse. The SpeedFusion tunnel may introduce overhead, potentially reducing speeds depending on the mode used; mirroring may slow down the connection while aggregation could increase speeds. For optimal performance, if using a MiFi device with the Peplink B-1 router, it should be set to IP passthrough mode and connected via USB tethering if not using the 5G model of the router.\n\n## Document_10\n\nPeplink's bonding technology, particularly SpeedFusion, allows for the aggregation of multiple WAN connections, providing increased reliability and bandwidth without the need for specialized carrier connectivity. Unlike traditional IPsec and LACP bonding methods, which have limitations such as requiring identical circuits or being sensitive to latency and packet loss, SpeedFusion can utilize any internet connection from various providers, including 4G, 5G, DSL, and satellite. This dynamic bonding capability enables users to achieve higher throughput and reliability, making it a compelling solution for businesses needing consistent internet performance. The technology emerged from the need to bond multiple connections for applications requiring more bandwidth than a single connection could provide, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.\n\n## Document_11\n\nPeplink's SpeedFusion technology provides a patented architecture for bonding multiple internet connections to enhance reliability, speed, and reduce latency and packet loss. It allows users to combine various WAN sources, including cellular and Wi-Fi, to create a seamless internet experience. SpeedFusion supports features like WAN smoothing, which reduces latency and jitter by duplicating packets across multiple WAN connections, and Forward Error Correction, which adds parity bits to maintain throughput while minimizing packet loss. This flexibility enables Peplink devices to adapt to different networking needs, making them suitable for various applications, including real-time video conferencing and broadcasting. The system can scale to accommodate numerous connections, as demonstrated by a user who bonded 101 internet connections, showcasing the technology's robustness and efficiency.\n\n## Document_12\n\nSpeedFusion is a tunnel bonded VPN technology that aggregates multiple internet connections to create a session-persistent and reliable VPN connection between two Peplink endpoints. It operates using AES 256-bit and 4096 DH encrypted tunnels, allowing for secure communication across various WAN circuits. Only the Hub site needs to have public or publicly accessible IP addresses, while peer sites can operate behind NAT or CGNAT, making it versatile for modern networking environments. SpeedFusion is easier to set up than traditional IPsec VPNs and offers greater capabilities, including the ability to bond multiple connections such as 5G and cable modems. The SDX router can support up to 200 remote peers, and configurations can be adjusted to avoid IP conflicts, ensuring seamless connectivity.\n\n## Document_13\n\nPeplink's SpeedFusion is a core product that enables the establishment of multiple VPN tunnels directly to clients' infrastructure, allowing for flexible management of voice services and other resources. The deployment strategies for SpeedFusion can vary, with options for self-hosted infrastructure or SpeedFusion Cloud, each catering to different client needs. The use of public IPs from data centers facilitates seamless reconnections for clients in case of disruptions. SpeedFusion can complement existing IPsec setups by providing a more seamless failover experience. Additionally, InControl2 offers enhanced remote management capabilities, allowing administrators to access devices behind Peplink routers without the need for separate management networks, thus improving operational efficiency and reducing the need for on-site visits.\n\n## Document_14\n\nPeplink offers solutions for unbreakable internet connectivity through its SpeedFusion Cloud technology, which allows users to connect SpeedFusion-compatible routers and subscribe to a service plan. This technology utilizes failover capabilities to ensure seamless connections, minimizing disruptions during activities such as video conferencing and streaming. One of the key features is the One Smoothing technology, which addresses packet loss by replicating lost packets during transmission, thus preventing jittering in video calls. Additionally, Peplink's bandwidth bonding technology enables the combination of multiple connections into a single VPN tunnel, enhancing bandwidth and redundancy without the need for complex setups. This approach allows for reliable internet access, even in challenging conditions, ensuring that users experience consistent connectivity for various applications.\n\n## Document_15\n\nTo utilize SpeedFusion or bonding, at least two Peplink devices are required, with one needing a public IP address. SpeedFusion offers multiple connection configurations, including point-to-point, mesh, and star topologies. Key features include bandwidth bonding, WAN smoothing to reduce jitter, and hot failover for maintaining session persistence during link failures. SpeedFusion Connect, Peplink's public bonding service, has a throughput limit of 200 Mbps, while hosting a FusionHub in a private cloud allows for unrestricted throughput based on the device's capabilities. WAN smoothing duplicates traffic across multiple connections to enhance reliability for VoIP and video applications, while Forward Error Correction (FEC) minimizes overhead during one-way communications. Outbound policies can be configured to manage traffic across different tunnels, optimizing performance for various applications.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo establish a site-to-site VPN between a Peplink-360 and Peplink-310 with a Cisco ASA, it is important to address the double NAT issue and the private IP configuration on the ASA. The peer ID on the Branch Peplink-310 should match the WAN IP of the HQ Peplink-360. The Branch Peplink-310 can operate with a PPPoE dialer and a fixed IP, but it is crucial to determine if aggressive mode is necessary for both the Peplink and Cisco ASA configurations. Creating a SpeedFusion VPN profile between the Peplink devices allows for custom outbound rules to manage traffic across the tunnel effectively.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe conversation discusses a network topology involving a Peplink-360 and Peplink-310 with a Cisco ASA for VPN termination. The HQ Peplink-360 is in VPN passthrough mode with a static IP, while the Branch Peplink-310 uses a PPPoE dialer with a fixed IP. The configuration faces issues due to double NAT and a private IP on the Cisco ASA, which is affecting the peer ID for the VPN connection. The user is exploring aggressive mode for IKE1 on the Peplink-310 and inquiring about the need for similar configuration changes on the Cisco ASA. The conversation suggests that the network design may need reevaluation and mentions the potential use of SpeedFusion VPN for better performance.\n\n## Document_18\n\nIn a network topology where a Cisco ASA is behind a Peplink-360 configured in VPN passthrough mode, issues arise due to double NAT and the use of a private IP address on the ASA. The peer ID on the Branch Peplink-310 is incorrectly identified as the private IP of the Cisco ASA instead of the WAN IP of the HQ Peplink-360. The Branch Peplink-310 has a PPPoE dialer with a fixed IP, which raises questions about its classification as a static IP and its compatibility with aggressive mode. The configuration attempts included using main mode for IKE1 and switching to aggressive mode, but success has not been achieved. The conversation also raises the need to consider whether the Cisco ASA should be configured in aggressive mode or main mode, and whether any adjustments are necessary on the HQ Peplink-360 in passthrough mode.\n\n## Document_19\n\nIn a network setup involving a Peplink-360 and Cisco ASA, the Peplink-360 is configured in VPN passthrough mode, which allows VPN traffic to pass through to the Cisco ASA. The Cisco ASA has a private IP address on its outside interface, leading to a double NAT situation. The Branch Peplink-310 is using a PPPoE dialer with a fixed IP address. For VPN configuration, the peer ID on the Branch Peplink-310 is incorrectly showing the private IP of the Cisco ASA instead of the WAN IP of the HQ Peplink-360. To resolve this, it is suggested to configure the Cisco ASA to use its private LAN IP as its WAN IP and set the Peplink as its WAN Gateway, avoiding the need to reconfigure remote VPN endpoints. Alternatively, obtaining a new WAN IP range for drop-in mode could be considered, but this would require significant reconfiguration.\n\n## Document_20\n\nTo combine a DSL fiber connection with a cable connection for increased bandwidth, SpeedFusion technology can be utilized, specifically with a FusionHub for optimal performance. It is important to ensure that both connections have low latency and minimal packet loss for effective bonding. The hardware required to achieve gigabit speeds will need to be robust, and users should check the SpeedFusion encrypted throughput specifications on the Peplink Balance routers to ensure they meet the necessary performance requirements.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo combine a fiber DSL connection with a cable connection at packet level, a Peplink multi-WAN Balance router with a SpeedFusion license is necessary. This setup allows for channel bonding, effectively increasing download and upload speeds by aggregating the bandwidth from both connections. It is important to ensure that the SpeedFusion license is included with the router or accounted for in the overall cost, as it can be expensive if purchased separately. Additionally, the router should be compatible with the existing network setup to avoid issues like double NAT, which can affect device connectivity and security.\n\n## Document_22\n\nTo combine a DSL fiber connection with a cable connection for improved overall internet speeds, a combination of load balancing and SpeedFusion technology can be utilized. SpeedFusion allows for the creation of a more reliable connection by aggregating bandwidth from multiple WAN sources. However, it is important to account for overhead, which can reduce effective speeds; for example, a combined upload speed of 140 Mbps may yield around 110 Mbps after accounting for overhead, and a combined download speed of 1000 Mbps may yield around 800 Mbps. Devices requiring a stable connection can be prioritized over SpeedFusion, while other devices can be connected directly to the gigabit WAN to avoid impacting SpeedFusion throughput.\n\n## Document_23\n\nTo combine a DSL fiber connection with a cable connection for increased bandwidth, a Pepwave router capable of channel bonding is needed. The goal is to achieve a combined speed of approximately 1 Gbps download and 140 Mbps upload without creating a double NAT situation, allowing the Google WiFi system to remain the DHCP handler. The user is looking for a non-WiFi Pepwave device that can handle high throughput, as residential-grade devices typically offer lower speeds.\n\n",

    "query": "How does Peplink SpeedFusion technology provide increased bandwidth, reliability, and seamless failover when bonding multiple internet connections, and what are the key configuration considerations and limitations compared to traditional IPsec VPNs?",
    "answer": "Peplink SpeedFusion technology bonds multiple internet connections (such as DSL, cable, 4G/5G, and satellite) to increase bandwidth, reliability, and provide seamless failover. Unlike traditional IPsec VPNs—which can only use a single WAN, are slower to recover from WAN failures, and may require identical circuits—SpeedFusion can aggregate bandwidth from diverse providers, ensuring sessions persist even if one WAN fails. SpeedFusion achieves this by establishing concurrent encrypted VPN tunnels (AES 256-bit) across all WANs between Peplink devices, distributing traffic to maximize available bandwidth and instantly rerouting traffic over healthy links during outages (Hot Failover). Additional features include WAN Smoothing (packet duplication for reduced jitter and packet loss), Forward Error Correction (for minimizing one-way loss), and various traffic management schemes (Bonding, Lowest Latency, Weighted Round Robin, Overflow). For implementation, both endpoints must be Peplink devices, with at least one having a public IP, and hardware must meet encrypted throughput requirements. However, bonding introduces protocol overhead (reducing effective speeds), and the solution requires compatible Peplink hardware with a SpeedFusion license. Unlike IPsec, SpeedFusion supports deployment behind NAT, can operate with only the hub site on public IP, and is easier to set up. Outbound policies and topology (point-to-point, mesh, star) can be customized for optimal performance.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_3\n\nFor improving cellular service inside an Airstream using a Peplink Max BR1 Pro 5G with a Mobility 42G, it is suggested to avoid using an amplifier like WeBoost due to potential interference issues. Instead, consider using a Peplink device that supports dual SIMs or a two-modem setup to manage different carriers. This allows for better connectivity without the complications of signal amplification, while also enabling guests to use Wi-Fi calling and texting through a guest network.\n\n## Document_4\n\nTo maintain optimal connectivity with the Peplink Max BR2 Pro using two Mobility 42G antennas, it is recommended to connect Modem 1 to Antenna 1 and Modem 2 to Antenna 2. For proper 5G operation, all four antennas are required unless switching to a 2x antenna mode. If some antenna connections receive good signals while others do not, the overall performance of the modem may be negatively impacted, as the modem expects all antennas to receive similar signal levels.\n\n## Document_5\n\nFor a sailing boat installation of multi modem LTE, the Peplink Max HD2 Dome mounted at the top of a 45m carbon mast and the Peplink MBX Mini with two Mobility 40G antennas on the first spreader (10m high) are being compared. The MBX Mini's 4x4 MIMO antennas with higher effective gain are expected to provide better performance in terms of bandwidth and range compared to the HD2 Dome, particularly within 2.5NM/5km from cell towers, while still achieving a minimum of 500kbit/s for applications like WhatsApp calls and basic surfing/email. Load balancing capabilities may require specific service plans from Peplink, which could incur additional costs.\n\n## Document_6\n\nFor connecting antennas to a Pepwave router, it is recommended to use either Cellular 1 (1A-1D) or Cellular 2 (2A-2D) for the four antenna connections, rather than splitting them across both cellular inputs. The successful connection configuration involves connecting antenna 1 to port A, antenna 2 to port C, antenna 3 to port B, and antenna 4 to port D on the router.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe Peplink Max BR1 5G router utilizes a single 5G modem chip, which means that only one cellular antenna port can connect to 5G at a time. The modem supports 4x4 MIMO technology, but for 5G connectivity, at least 2x2 MIMO is required. MIMO technology is designed to be aimed in one direction, as the serving cell expects a single client signal from a specific location. Therefore, to achieve multiple directional connections, multiple modems would be necessary.\n\n## Document_8\n\nFor optimal performance with a 5G modem, it is necessary to connect all four antennas in a MIMO configuration, as different bands used by the 5G modem require specific antenna combinations. Directional antennas should all be pointed in the same direction to maximize signal reception.\n\n## Document_9\n\nTo optimize antenna configuration for the Pepwave MAX BR2 Pro, it is recommended to use two 4x4 MIMO antennas with some separation for best performance. If firmware version 8.3 is installed, enabling the 'two antenna mode' will provide guidance on which ports to connect the antennas. The number of SIM cards is not critical for performance, as having one SIM in SIM-A of each modem suffices unless carrier failover or data cap considerations are necessary.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe HD2-DOME is a router with an integrated LTE modem and antennas, not just an antenna. It provides an IP address via DHCP for the SIM Injector and other devices on the same LAN. The SIM Injector's PoE output can be enabled or disabled through its web management page, but the output voltage cannot be controlled. For installation details, the technical manual is available on the Peplink website, which includes various SIM Injector installation topology scenarios and optional settings for enabling roaming for SIM cards.\n\n## Document_11\n\nA proposed design for a mounting sleeve for the HD Dome includes an M35 Female thread on one end to cover the M35 thread of the Dome and a 1\"x 14 standard Female thread on the other end to fit onto a 1\"x 14 standard male maritime fitting. The material suggested for the mount is 316 stainless steel, and there is a consideration for a cable exit opening versus having cables go through the base. A design for a two-piece stainless mount has been created to prevent cable twisting during installation, although the manufacturing cost is noted to be high.\n\n## Document_12\n\nUsing two 4x4 MIMO antennas for the Pepwave BR2 is feasible, and there are options for 8x8 MIMO omni-directional antennas available from manufacturers like Parsec and Poynting. However, it is important to consider signal loss over distance when setting up the antennas. Waveform's recommendation to use a single 4x4 antenna for both modems may not be optimal for maximizing signal strength and performance.\n\n## Document_13\n\nTo bond a T-Mobile 5G connection with WiFi from an RV park using a Peplink Max BR1 5G Pro, SpeedFusion or a self-hosted Fusion Hub is required. The SpeedFusion technology has a speed cap of 200 Mbps and typically achieves less than 100 Mbps. The Max BR1 5G Pro supports WiFi-As-WAN, allowing it to pick up and rebroadcast public WiFi signals, which can be used alongside a cellular connection for local internet access.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe Peplink Max BR1 5G Pro supports WiFi-As-WAN, allowing users to connect to public WiFi signals from hotspots and rebroadcast them within their local network. To bond a WiFi connection with a T-Mobile 5G signal, Peplink's SpeedFusion software is typically required. However, the Max BR1 can also manage multiple connections, such as a T-Mobile plan and Starlink, without needing additional bonding software, depending on the setup.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Peplink Max BR1 5G Pro supports WiFi-As-WAN, allowing users to connect to public WiFi signals from hotspots, campgrounds, and other sources, which can then be rebroadcasted as a local WiFi network. To bond a T-Mobile 5G connection with a Starlink connection, it is possible to use the WAN input channel of the BR1 to combine these services. However, it is unclear whether this bonding requires SpeedFusion software or if it can be done without additional hardware or software.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe video discusses the process of bulk updating firmware for multiple Pepwave routers using the actions menu in the dashboard. Users can select multiple devices and apply a firmware policy to them simultaneously, allowing for efficient management of firmware updates. The process involves navigating to the dashboard, selecting the devices, and using the actions menu to push the desired firmware version, such as the HD1 Dome Pro 8.5 firmware, to all selected devices at once. This method eliminates the need for manual updates for each individual device, streamlining the firmware management process.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe Peplink Max HD2 Dome does not support 5G, making the Peplink MBX Mini a better choice for 4/5G connectivity. The performance of cellular connections depends significantly on the location, capacity, and configuration of cell towers. A multi-modem router increases the likelihood of maintaining service by allowing the use of multiple carriers. For optimal performance, antenna cable lengths should be kept short (ideally under 5m/15ft) to minimize signal loss. Load balancing is available out of the box without additional service plans, but for bonding or hitless failover, SpeedFusion is required, which incurs costs depending on the chosen service plan. Using SpeedFusion Cloud or hosting a FusionHub can provide additional features, including inbound routing for remote access to devices on the boat.\n\n## Document_18\n\nFor a sailing boat installation of multi modem LTE, it is suggested to consider Maritime antennas over Mobility antennas for improved performance, especially in varying sea conditions. While the Peplink MBX Mini with 2x Mobility 40G offers 4x4 MIMO and higher effective gain, the use of specialized Maritime antennas could provide significant advantages in terms of connectivity and reliability. The impact of antenna choice on expected bandwidth near shore and range should be evaluated, particularly for maintaining a minimum of 500 kbit/s for applications like WhatsApp calls and basic surfing/email. Additionally, load balancing with Peplink may involve specific service plans, which should be clarified for associated costs.\n\n## Document_19\n\nFor a high-performing cellular setup on a sailing boat, the Peplink MBX Mini is considered superior to the HD2 Dome in terms of performance and future-proofing. The MBX Mini requires 8 antenna elements, which may pose an aesthetic compromise. It can also accommodate multiple Ethernet WAN connections, allowing for configuration flexibility. When considering antenna placement, it's important to engage with a local partner experienced in marine setups due to the unique challenges posed by the maritime environment. Load balancing capabilities may require specific service plans, but costs were not detailed in the conversation.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe MAX BR2 Pro requires a total of 8 antennas for optimal performance, with 4 antennas designated for each of its 2 cellular SIM slots. A user has connected 4 roof antennas to SIM slots 1A and 2A, while using paddle antennas for the remaining ports. It is suggested that the roof antennas could potentially be connected to all ports of Cell 1, while paddle antennas could be used for Cell 2, but the optimal configuration may depend on the specific firmware version and antenna requirements for 5G connectivity.\n\n## Document_21\n\nThe distance between the SIM Injector and the HD2-DOME antenna can be up to 100 meters, making a 40-meter distance feasible. The HD2-DOME can be powered either via the SIM Injector or with a separate PoE adapter. If using the SIM Injector to power the HD2-DOME, the power input voltage should be 56V.\n\n## Document_22\n\nFor mounting the HD Dome, a sleeve with M35 Female on one end and 1\"x 14 standard Female on the other end made of 316 Stainless-steel is proposed. A cable exit opening option is discussed, with a preference for a plastic version with a punch out for cable management, along with the use of sealant or rubber O-rings to ensure water tightness. The majority of installations utilize a threaded mount that goes through into the void below, while a smaller percentage use a punch out for cable exit.\n\n## Document_23\n\nFor mounting the HD Dome, a sleeve with an M35 Female end to cover the M35 thread and a 1\"x 14 standard Female end for compatibility with a maritime fitting is proposed. The sleeve would be made of 316 Stainless-steel. There is a consideration for a cable exit opening versus having cables run through the base of the mount. Additionally, a commonly used mast mount is referenced, which features a 1\"x 14 thread, raising questions about compatibility and sufficient stand-off distance from the mast to ensure proper fit and function of the dome.\n\n## Document_24\n\nThe proposed mounting solution for the HD Dome includes a sleeve with an M35 Female thread on one end to cover the Dome's M35 thread and a 1\"x 14 standard Female thread on the other end to fit onto a 1\"x 14 standard male maritime fitting, made from 316 stainless steel. There is a consideration for a cable exit opening or allowing cables to go through the base of the fitting, with some concerns about installation challenges related to cable twisting.\n\n## Document_25\n\nThe proposed adapter for mounting the HD Dome would feature an M35 Female thread on one end to cover the M35 thread of the Dome and a 1\"x 14 standard Female thread on the other end to fit onto a 1\"x 14 standard male maritime fitting. The adapter would be made of 316 stainless steel, and there is a consideration for a cable exit opening versus having the cables go through the base of the standard fitting.\n\n## Document_26\n\nThe proposed adapter for mounting the HD Dome features an M35 Female thread on one end to cover the M35 thread of the Dome and a 1\"x 14 standard Female thread on the other end to fit onto a 1\"x 14 standard male maritime fitting. The adapter is suggested to be made of 316 Stainless-steel, and there is a consideration for a cable exit opening or allowing cables to go through the base of the mount.\n\n## Document_27\n\nA custom mounting solution for the HD Dome has been designed and fabricated, available in either Marine Grade Stainless Steel or Aluminium, with the latter being suitable for weight-sensitive applications. The design utilizes a standard antenna spring mount for enhanced strength and serviceability, employing six screw mounts for secure attachment. This configuration ensures environmental sealing for the HD1 Dome's ethernet connection and allows the use of toolless ethernet plugs for easier connectivity.\n\n## Document_28\n\nA mounting sleeve for the HD Dome is being proposed, featuring an M35 Female thread on one end to cover the M35 thread of the Dome and a 1\"x 14 standard Female thread on the other end to fit onto a 1\"x 14 standard male maritime fitting. The sleeve will be made of 316 Stainless-steel. There is also a consideration for a cable exit opening or allowing cables to go through the base of the fitting.\n\n",

      "The HD2-DOME is a router with an integrated LTE modem and antennas, not just an antenna. It provides an IP address via DHCP for the SIM Injector and other devices on the same LAN. The SIM Injector's PoE output can be enabled or disabled through its web management page, but the output voltage cannot be controlled. For installation details, the technical manual is available on the Peplink website, which includes various SIM Injector installation topology scenarios and optional settings for enabling roaming for SIM cards.",
      "A proposed design for a mounting sleeve for the HD Dome includes an M35 Female thread on one end to cover the M35 thread of the Dome and a 1\"x 14 standard Female thread on the other end to fit onto a 1\"x 14 standard male maritime fitting. The material suggested for the mount is 316 stainless steel, and there is a consideration for a cable exit opening versus having cables go through the base. A design for a two-piece stainless mount has been created to prevent cable twisting during installation, although the manufacturing cost is noted to be high.",
      "Using two 4x4 MIMO antennas for the Pepwave BR2 is feasible, and there are options for 8x8 MIMO omni-directional antennas available from manufacturers like Parsec and Poynting. However, it is important to consider signal loss over distance when setting up the antennas. Waveform's recommendation to use a single 4x4 antenna for both modems may not be optimal for maximizing signal strength and performance.",
      "To bond a T-Mobile 5G connection with WiFi from an RV park using a Peplink Max BR1 5G Pro, SpeedFusion or a self-hosted Fusion Hub is required. The SpeedFusion technology has a speed cap of 200 Mbps and typically achieves less than 100 Mbps. The Max BR1 5G Pro supports WiFi-As-WAN, allowing it to pick up and rebroadcast public WiFi signals, which can be used alongside a cellular connection for local internet access.",
      "The Peplink Max BR1 5G Pro supports WiFi-As-WAN, allowing users to connect to public WiFi signals from hotspots and rebroadcast them within their local network. To bond a WiFi connection with a T-Mobile 5G signal, Peplink's SpeedFusion software is typically required. However, the Max BR1 can also manage multiple connections, such as a T-Mobile plan and Starlink, without needing additional bonding software, depending on the setup.",
      "The Peplink Max BR1 5G Pro supports WiFi-As-WAN, allowing users to connect to public WiFi signals from hotspots, campgrounds, and other sources, which can then be rebroadcasted as a local WiFi network. To bond a T-Mobile 5G connection with a Starlink connection, it is possible to use the WAN input channel of the BR1 to combine these services. However, it is unclear whether this bonding requires SpeedFusion software or if it can be done without additional hardware or software.",
      "The video discusses the process of bulk updating firmware for multiple Pepwave routers using the actions menu in the dashboard. Users can select multiple devices and apply a firmware policy to them simultaneously, allowing for efficient management of firmware updates. The process involves navigating to the dashboard, selecting the devices, and using the actions menu to push the desired firmware version, such as the HD1 Dome Pro 8.5 firmware, to all selected devices at once. This method eliminates the need for manual updates for each individual device, streamlining the firmware management process.",
      "The Peplink Max HD2 Dome does not support 5G, making the Peplink MBX Mini a better choice for 4/5G connectivity. The performance of cellular connections depends significantly on the location, capacity, and configuration of cell towers. A multi-modem router increases the likelihood of maintaining service by allowing the use of multiple carriers. For optimal performance, antenna cable lengths should be kept short (ideally under 5m/15ft) to minimize signal loss. Load balancing is available out of the box without additional service plans, but for bonding or hitless failover, SpeedFusion is required, which incurs costs depending on the chosen service plan. Using SpeedFusion Cloud or hosting a FusionHub can provide additional features, including inbound routing for remote access to devices on the boat.",
      "For a sailing boat installation of multi modem LTE, it is suggested to consider Maritime antennas over Mobility antennas for improved performance, especially in varying sea conditions. While the Peplink MBX Mini with 2x Mobility 40G offers 4x4 MIMO and higher effective gain, the use of specialized Maritime antennas could provide significant advantages in terms of connectivity and reliability. The impact of antenna choice on expected bandwidth near shore and range should be evaluated, particularly for maintaining a minimum of 500 kbit/s for applications like WhatsApp calls and basic surfing/email. Additionally, load balancing with Peplink may involve specific service plans, which should be clarified for associated costs.",
      "For a high-performing cellular setup on a sailing boat, the Peplink MBX Mini is considered superior to the HD2 Dome in terms of performance and future-proofing. The MBX Mini requires 8 antenna elements, which may pose an aesthetic compromise. It can also accommodate multiple Ethernet WAN connections, allowing for configuration flexibility. When considering antenna placement, it's important to engage with a local partner experienced in marine setups due to the unique challenges posed by the maritime environment. Load balancing capabilities may require specific service plans, but costs were not detailed in the conversation.",
      "The MAX BR2 Pro requires a total of 8 antennas for optimal performance, with 4 antennas designated for each of its 2 cellular SIM slots. A user has connected 4 roof antennas to SIM slots 1A and 2A, while using paddle antennas for the remaining ports. It is suggested that the roof antennas could potentially be connected to all ports of Cell 1, while paddle antennas could be used for Cell 2, but the optimal configuration may depend on the specific firmware version and antenna requirements for 5G connectivity.",
      "The distance between the SIM Injector and the HD2-DOME antenna can be up to 100 meters, making a 40-meter distance feasible. The HD2-DOME can be powered either via the SIM Injector or with a separate PoE adapter. If using the SIM Injector to power the HD2-DOME, the power input voltage should be 56V.",
      "For mounting the HD Dome, a sleeve with M35 Female on one end and 1\"x 14 standard Female on the other end made of 316 Stainless-steel is proposed. A cable exit opening option is discussed, with a preference for a plastic version with a punch out for cable management, along with the use of sealant or rubber O-rings to ensure water tightness.

    "query": "When installing a Peplink MBX Mini or MAX BR2 Pro with 4x4 or 8x8 MIMO antennas on a sailing boat, what are the key considerations for antenna configuration and mounting, and how do these affect performance, especially compared to the HD2 Dome?",
    "answer": "For optimal cellular performance on a sailing boat, the Peplink MBX Mini and MAX BR2 Pro require careful antenna configuration and mounting. The MBX Mini needs 8 antenna elements for best results, while the MAX BR2 Pro requires a total of 8 antennas, with 4 per modem/SIM slot. Using two 4x4 MIMO antennas with some separation is recommended for the BR2 Pro, and all antennas should be connected in a MIMO configuration for 5G. Directional antennas should be pointed in the same direction, and cable runs should be kept short to minimize signal loss. Maritime antennas may provide better performance than mobility antennas in marine environments. Compared to the HD2 Dome, which does not support 5G and integrates its antennas, the MBX Mini and BR2 Pro with external high-gain MIMO antennas offer better bandwidth, range, and future-proofing, especially within 2.5NM/5km of shore. Proper mounting solutions—such as stainless steel sleeves with M35 and 1\"x14 threads—ensure secure installation and cable management. Load balancing is available out of the box, but features like bonding or seamless failover require SpeedFusion and may incur additional costs.",

The current model supports a throughput of 150 Mbps when on the latest firmware.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a throughput speed that can vary between 100 Mbps and 150 Mbps, which may depend on factors such as firmware or hardware configurations. To verify the actual throughput speed, it is recommended to test the connection directly to the WAN using a PC, rather than through a gigabit rated switch.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe throughput speed of the Peplink Balance 20 can be either 100 Mbps or 150 Mbps, which may depend on the specific hardware version or firmware. The R6 model is expected to achieve the higher throughput of 150 Mbps.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe older Peplink Balance 20 model has a hardware revision that limits its throughput to 100 Mbps, which explains the reduced download speeds observed when the router is connected. In contrast, newer hardware revisions of the Balance 20 can support speeds up to 150 Mbps. Therefore, the performance drop when using the router is likely due to its hardware limitations rather than a configuration issue.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 and 30 routers are limited to approximately 200mb throughput, which creates a bottleneck for users in areas where gigabit download speeds are being rolled out. The current lineup of Peplink routers does not support gigabit throughput until the 300 series and higher. This limitation affects small business and residential users who expect to utilize gigabit service without significant speed loss, as they may experience a 40% drop in speed when using these routers.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, which explains why the user is experiencing lower download speeds despite having a 1Gbps connection from Comcast. The user should refer to the provided guide to understand the difference between port speed and the actual throughput rating of the device.\n\n## Document_7\n\nIf experiencing lower throughput than expected from a cable modem service, it may be due to using an older version of the Peplink Balance 20, which is rated for a maximum throughput of 20 Mbps. Upgrading to a newer version of the Balance 20, which can handle up to 100 Mbps, is recommended to achieve higher speeds.\n\n## Document_8\n\nTo achieve higher throughput on a Peplink Balance One Core, it is recommended to perform a factory reset and only apply essential changes for testing, as unnecessary configurations can increase CPU load and decrease performance. Features like Mitigate Bufferbloat can limit speeds to ensure low latency. The Balance One Core can handle connections over 600Mbps, and users considering higher speeds may look into upgrading to the Balance 20X or the upcoming next-generation SOHO model, which is expected to be released soon.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe Peplink Balance 30 has a maximum throughput of 100Mbps, which could be the reason for experiencing reduced speeds when connected through the router compared to a direct connection to the modem. To achieve higher speeds, an upgrade to a Peplink Balance 310 is recommended.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Balance 30 LTE has a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, which is a hardware limitation that cannot be exceeded. For users needing higher speeds, upgrading to a Balance One or Balance 305 is recommended, and Peplink support can assist in converting the configuration file to the new model.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a router throughput rating of 100 Mbps, which is a limiting factor for the maximum speed experienced when connected through the device. The Balance 20 features 4 Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) LAN ports, but the overall throughput is determined by the router's specifications. Users should consider the total throughput by adding the upload and download speeds of all WAN connections to understand performance limitations.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo achieve higher download speeds with a Peplink Balance router, it is recommended to use a Balance 305 or a model rated for higher throughput, as the Balance 20 is rated for a maximum of 200Mbps. This may explain the slower speeds experienced when routing through the Peplink device compared to a direct connection to the ISP's router.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 device has a maximum throughput rating of 20Mbps, which may limit speeds when connected to a higher-speed internet service. The newer model of the Balance 20, which features a metal enclosure, is rated for up to 100Mbps throughput, indicating that upgrading to this newer model could resolve speed limitations experienced with the older version.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 is suitable for managing multiple WAN connections and can support protocol binding for VOIP lines to specific WANs with failover capabilities. It allows for QoS prioritization for VOIP and Skype traffic, ensuring that these applications maintain performance during bandwidth fluctuations. The device can automatically switch traffic between WANs based on availability, and it is capable of handling varying bandwidth scenarios without manual adjustments. The Peplink system is designed to optimize load balancing and can provide seamless failover for VOIP lines, although specific settings and configurations would need to be established for optimal performance.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20X (B20X) is rated for a maximum throughput of 60Mbps when using SpeedFusion VPN with encryption. The performance may be significantly lower when using OpenVPN, which could explain the clients' inability to achieve speeds over 20Mbps on a 1Gbps fiber connection.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe Balance ONE and CORE models from Peplink support throughput of up to 600Mbps, which is reduced to 400Mbps when using five WAN connections. These models have been successfully used with 1Gbps/200Mbps links for three years without issues.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo troubleshoot slow internet speeds when connected through a Peplink router to a Cisco gigabit switch, it is recommended to ensure that the Peplink device is running firmware version 5.4.9 or higher. If the issue persists, opening a support ticket with Peplink for further assistance is advisable.\n\n## Document_18\n\nWhen experiencing slower internet speeds through a Peplink router compared to a direct modem connection, it is suggested to test the individual connections to assess their metrics. The Peplink Balance 20 does not support SpeedFusion technology, but it can still perform load balancing between connections. Additionally, updating the firmware to version 5.4.9 may help improve performance.\n\n## Document_19\n\nTo accurately test the actual capacity of internet connections through a Peplink router, it is recommended to use a speed test that allows multiple streams, as traditional speed test sites like speedtest.net typically only open a single socket for testing, which may not reflect the aggregate throughput.\n\n",

    "query": "How does InControl 2 facilitate scalable, secure, and efficient network management for organizations with multiple Peplink devices, and what best practices and precautions should a technician follow when using its centralized configuration features?",
    "answer": "InControl 2 enables scalable and efficient management of multiple Peplink devices by providing a centralized, cloud-based platform for configuration, monitoring, firmware management, reporting, and policy enforcement. Organizations can structure their device management hierarchically (organization, group, device), push consistent VLAN, firewall, and outbound policy settings, and manage Wi-Fi and SSIDs across all sites, ensuring compliance and simplifying administration. Bulk configuration and template features allow technicians to deploy settings to many devices simultaneously, while centralized firmware and policy management streamline updates and security practices. InControl 2 also supports real-time diagnostics, device status dashboards, notifications, and geofencing, further enhancing operational oversight.\n\nFor secure management, it is recommended that technicians set up user accounts, register devices to claim ownership, and enable two-factor authentication. After securing ownership, InControl 2 management should be disabled on the device itself if remote cloud management is not required, reducing the attack surface. Technicians should be aware that enabling centralized management features (such as Wi-Fi or VLAN management) will overwrite local device settings with group or organization-level profiles, so changes should be carefully coordinated and tested, especially in large or sensitive deployments. Centralized content filtering, firewall, and outbound policy rules should be tailored to organizational needs and compliance requirements, leveraging tagging and group policies for flexible deployment. Firmware updates and configuration changes should be staged and validated before broad rollout, using rollback features if needed. Maintaining an active warranty or license ensures continued access to InControl 2’s full capabilities. Finally, technicians should monitor device and event logs, utilize reporting features for troubleshooting and optimization, and manage user access with appropriate roles and idle timeouts for security and compliance.",

SpeedFusion is a VPN bonding technology that incurs overhead from additional headers, which can reduce the effective bandwidth. The theoretical bonded bandwidth calculation accounts for this overhead, estimating a combined throughput of approximately 32 Mbps under ideal conditions. Testing tools such as SpeedFusion graphs and speed tests can help diagnose performance issues, with packet loss being a significant factor affecting bandwidth performance.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo increase bandwidth and speed by joining an Ethernet WAN connection and a cellular connection on a Peplink Balance 30 Pro, one can utilize SpeedFusion technology. SpeedFusion allows for bandwidth bonding, which combines multiple internet connections for improved performance. The user should consider the differences between SpeedFusion, SpeedFusion Cloud, and FusionHub, as these options provide various capabilities for establishing tunnels and managing connections, particularly when remote equipment is involved.\n\n## Document_11\n\nSpeedFusion technology allows for the combination of multiple WAN connections to enhance internet speed and reliability. It operates on a hierarchy where PepVPN serves as the foundation, followed by SpeedFusion Hot Failover and then SpeedFusion Bonding. Traffic management approaches can be applied on top of bonding, including options such as Bonding, Lowest Latency, Weighted Round Robin, and Overflow. WAN Smoothing can be enabled to duplicate packets for reduced packet loss, consuming additional bandwidth. If WAN Smoothing is set to maximum, the SpeedFusion distribution algorithm is ignored, but at lower levels, duplicate packets are distributed according to the selected traffic distribution rules. In scenarios where the Lowest Latency distribution is used, SpeedFusion continuously selects the WAN with the lowest latency for outbound packets, adjusting as network conditions change.\n\n## Document_12\n\nSpeedFusion technology allows for true WAN bonding only within a SpeedFusion VPN deployment. If not deployed in this manner, users will experience link load balancing instead of bonding. Therefore, to achieve the desired WAN speed increase by combining multiple radio connections, a SpeedFusion VPN deployment is necessary.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe MAX On The Go router is rated for a maximum throughput of 100 Mbps, which limits the total bandwidth available for download even when multiple 4G dongles are connected. To achieve better performance, it is recommended to use the Weighted Balance outbound policy to ensure that traffic is distributed across all WAN connections. Additionally, cellular share bandwidth can occur when using multiple dongles from the same service provider, potentially limiting the effective bandwidth.\n\n## Document_14\n\nSpeedFusion Bonding is a feature that aggregates traffic at the packet level across multiple WAN links, allowing for improved bandwidth utilization.

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nThe older Peplink Balance 20 model has a hardware revision that limits its throughput to 100 Mbps, which explains the reduced download speeds observed when the router is connected. In contrast, newer hardware revisions of the Balance 20 can support speeds up to 150 Mbps. Therefore, the performance drop when using the router is likely due to its hardware limitations rather than a configuration issue.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 and 30 routers are limited to approximately 200mb throughput, which creates a bottleneck for users in areas where gigabit download speeds are being rolled out. The current lineup of Peplink routers does not support gigabit throughput until the 300 series and higher. This limitation affects small business and residential users who expect to utilize gigabit service without significant speed loss, as they may experience a 40% drop in speed when using these routers.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 and 30 routers are rated for 100 Mbps of throughput, which includes both upload and download speeds. They support various types of WAN connections, including Ethernet and USB, although some USB connections may require a firmware update. The Balance series is designed to handle multiple WAN connections, ensuring seamless failover in case one connection drops.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe maximum throughput for the Peplink Balance 30 is 100Mbps, and it is expected to achieve close to this without dropping packets. The device can effectively balance traffic between multiple links, and Peplink offers advanced load balancing algorithms to tailor traffic distribution. While the Balance 30 can meet basic needs, the Balance 380 is recommended for higher throughput and additional enterprise features, such as a built-in PPTP VPN Server.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe Peplink Balance 30 is rated for a maximum throughput of 100Mbps for both upload and download speeds. If the combined speeds of the connected ISPs exceed this limit, performance issues may arise due to bottlenecking. For higher throughput needs, upgrading to a Peplink Balance 380, which supports up to 170Mbps, is recommended. The Peplink Balance can provide benefits such as traffic prioritization through load balancing, quality of service (QoS) assignment on an application or port level, and hardware firewall capabilities, enhancing overall network performance and flexibility.\n\n## Document_6\n\nIn a network configuration involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 routers connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is important to ensure that outbound rules are correctly set up for traffic to traverse from the satellite sites to Azure. The Balance 508 needs to properly advertise its routes to the connected 305 devices for successful end-to-end connectivity.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe outbound policy configuration on the PepLink Balance 508 was successfully adjusted, allowing the connected Balance 305 devices to traverse to Azure through the established IP Sec VPN tunnels. This indicates that proper routing and policy settings are essential for enabling connectivity between satellite sites and Azure.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a throughput of 150Mbps, which is less than the combined total of the user's WAN connections (100/5M, 150/6M, and 35/5M). For users with 20-30 connections, particularly for applications like Zoom, upgrading to a Peplink Balance 305 is recommended due to its higher capacity and performance, supporting up to 1Gbps throughput. Alternatively, the Balance 210 with an additional license can provide a maximum throughput of 350Mbps, but it is not as capable as the Balance 305.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe Peplink Balance 300, which is approximately 15 years old, supports a maximum throughput of 20Mbps. Therefore, if clients are experiencing a maximum speed of 15Mbps, this is within the expected performance limits of the device, despite having three WAN connections with a total potential speed of 300Mbps.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Stateful Firewall Throughput of the Peplink Balance 30 Pro is 400 Mbps, which typically refers to the maximum throughput for a single download from WAN to LAN. In a scenario with WAN1 at 250 Mbps up/down and WAN2 at 8 Mbps up/down, the Balance 30 Pro can handle a maximum of 258 Mbps download without issues most of the time. However, if simultaneous full utilization of both WAN connections is expected, a bottleneck may occur. For users with many devices or complex routing needs, the Balance One may be a better option due to its higher throughput capabilities.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a maximum throughput limit of 150Mbps, which is tied to its hardware. To achieve gigabit speeds, users must upgrade to a Balance 305 or a higher model. Future hardware revisions may allow for increased throughput in new models, but currently, there are no upgrade options for the Balance 20 to support higher speeds.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo load balance over 10 VDSL routers using a single WAN interface, a suitable device would be a Peplink SD-WAN router that supports multiple WAN interfaces. Options include the Balance 1350 or Balance 2500, which can handle 10 WAN interfaces, or using three Balance Ones, where two of them can be unlocked to support 5 WANs each via an add-on license. This setup allows for effective load balancing while considering throughput requirements of over 300 Mbps.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Peplink Balance 30 operates by directing traffic down a single WAN during speed checks, but the overall download speed can approximate the sum of multiple WAN capacities when multiple sessions are active. The performance depends on the selected load balancing algorithm. The older firmware version 4.7.0 on the older Balance 30 is limited to an upgrade to 4.8.1, and the device is considered deprecated compared to newer models that offer improved speed and security.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe latest firmware for the Peplink Balance 20W is v4.8.1, and this model has been obsoleted. Users are advised to consider refreshing their router for updated features and support.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Peplink Balance e30 is not a DSL modem and does not have RJ11 ports; it only features RJ45 Ethernet ports. To connect the Balance router to an ADSL connection, a separate DSL modem is required that provides an Ethernet output to connect to the Balance's WAN port.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe Peplink Balance 30 Pro features 2 Gigabit Ethernet WAN ports and has a Stateful Firewall Throughput of 400Mbps. This configuration allows for high-speed internet connections, but the user is questioning the utility of Gigabit WAN ports if they are not routable, especially in light of their observed speeds of 380Mbps down and 360Mbps up after upgrading to fiber.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe Balance ONE and CORE models from Peplink support throughput of up to 600Mbps, which is reduced to 400Mbps when using five WAN connections. These models have been successfully used with 1Gbps/200Mbps links for three years without issues.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Balance 20 and 30 routers have the same technical specifications, with the primary difference being that the Balance 30 includes an additional WAN port. The Balance 210 offers advantages such as support for a greater number of users, a more extensive list of Outbound Load Balancing options (7 options compared to 5 on the 20/30), and increased VPN capabilities not available on the 20 or 30 models. All models support multi-WAN configurations and can accommodate various internet connections including cable, DSL, and 3G/4G.\n\n## Document_19\n\nBoth the Peplink Balance 20 and Balance 30 can be configured for 2 Ethernet connections, while the Balance 30 supports 3 Ethernet connections. Additionally, both models allow for 1 USB 3G/4G connection, which can be set up for backup use through Outbound Policy or WAN status. Users can also implement a bandwidth cap on the USB/Mobile connection to disable it upon reaching a monthly data allowance.\n\n## Document_20\n\nIn a network configuration involving PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is noted that IP Sec tunnels do not typically advertise their routes through second hops. To enable connectivity from satellite sites to Azure, a static route for the Azure subnet can be added on the satellite devices, pointing to the Balance 508. Additionally, firewall configurations on both the satellite sites and Azure may need to be reviewed to ensure they allow the necessary traffic exchange.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo enable connectivity from PepLink Balance 305 devices to Azure through a Balance 508, static routes can be configured on the Balance 305 for the Azure subnet, using the Balance 508 as the gateway. Additionally, the Azure configuration should include a static route for the Balance 305 subnet, also using the Balance 508 as the gateway. It is important to ensure that firewall rules on both ends permit this routing to function correctly.\n\n## Document_22\n\nIn a network setup involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via a star topology, issues may arise with route advertisement to Azure through IP Sec VPN tunnels. The Balance 508 may not be advertising its routes to the connected Balance 305 devices, which can prevent satellite sites from accessing Azure. Additionally, static routes may need to connect to gateways within the same subnet, which can complicate configurations if sites are not willing to share a common subnet.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 is undersized for applications involving 20-30 users, particularly with high-demand activities like Zoom calls. For improved performance, it is recommended to consider upgrading to a Peplink Balance One, Balance 210 (with the 3rd WAN port activated), or Balance 305. Engaging a Peplink Partner for tailored recommendations based on specific needs is also advised.\n\n## Document_24\n\nThe Balance 300 router supports a maximum throughput of 20mbps per user, despite having three WAN connections each capable of 100mbps. This means that while the total potential speed from the WAN connections is 300mbps, the router's limitations restrict the actual usable speed to 20mbps per user, indicating that the additional bandwidth from the WAN connections is not utilized effectively.\n\n## Document_25\n\nThe Balance 20 router has a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, which is insufficient for users with ISPs offering speeds of 600Mbps and plans for 1000Mbps in the near future. Users are inquiring about potential upgrades for the Balance 20 to support higher throughput speeds or the necessity of upgrading to the Balance 305 to accommodate increasing ISP speeds. There is concern regarding the cost-effectiveness of purchasing a new router that may soon become obsolete as ISPs continue to enhance their offerings.\n\n## Document_26\n\nThe older Balance 30 router is limited to firmware version 4.8.1 and does not support SpeedFusion bonding. The latest supported firmware for the older Balance 30 is 6.4.3, while the newer Balance 30 can run version 7.0.1. It is advised to avoid using outdated hardware on networks due to security concerns.\n\n## Document_27\n\nTo connect a Peplink Balance e30 to an ADSL connection, the DSL router should be configured in Bridge mode to allow the Peplink to handle the PPPoE authentication. If the DSL router is set to authenticate, the Peplink WAN must be configured to either specify an IP address or to automatically obtain an address from the DSL router.\n\n",

    "query": "Given increasing gigabit ISP speeds, what are the practical throughput limitations of the Peplink Balance 20 and 30 series routers, how do these limitations differ across hardware revisions, and what upgrade paths are recommended for users needing higher throughput?",
    "answer": "The Peplink Balance 20 and 30 series routers have hardware throughput limitations that prevent them from utilizing gigabit ISP speeds. The Balance 20 typically supports up to 100 Mbps on older hardware, with some revisions supporting up to 150 Mbps. The Balance 30 is also limited to 100 Mbps throughput, despite having multiple WAN ports. These throughput limits mean that users with ISP speeds of 600 Mbps or 1 Gbps will experience significant bottlenecking, with actual network speeds reduced to the router's maximum throughput. The Balance 20 and 30 do not support gigabit throughput; support for such speeds begins with the Balance 305 and higher models, which can provide up to 1 Gbps throughput. Therefore, users seeking to take advantage of high-speed or gigabit ISP services are advised to upgrade to the Balance 305 or higher models, as there are no upgrade options available for the Balance 20 or 30 to support higher speeds.

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nIn a Pepwave Transit Pro (Duo) setup with 4 active SIMs and Fusion Connect Active, SpeedFusion Connect functions as an additional connection option, effectively acting like a third SIM slot for each modem. Users can select between connecting to the primary SIMs (A/B) or the SpeedFusion Connect (SFConnect).\n\n## Document_2\n\nBand 12 is a lower frequency that provides better coverage over longer distances, which is why it may show a stronger signal (5 bars). However, it has limited bandwidth assigned to it, primarily designed for voice calls and messaging, which may explain why internet connectivity is not functioning properly on this band.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe MAX BR1 MK2 may face connectivity issues with T-Mobile if it does not support the bands that T-Mobile uses in certain areas, specifically bands 7 and 12. The router is currently connecting to Band 5, which may not be sufficient for optimal performance. To check the primary band being used by an iPhone, one can enter the code ***3001#12345#*** to access the serving cell information.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe issue of GPS location updates failing on Pepwave devices may be related to the GPS antenna rather than the devices themselves. Users have reported intermittent functionality with both a 7 in 1 antenna and the GPS antenna provided with the Transit DUO and Transit Pro. The GPS signal may resume after rebooting the router, suggesting potential reliability issues with the antennas. For persistent problems, it is recommended to download a diagnostic file from the status page and submit a ticket to Peplink engineering for further investigation.\n\n## Document_5\n\nFor a Transit Max 5G setup with a dual element panel antenna, it is currently connected to main 1 and 2, while a roof mount 7-in-1 antenna is connected to aux 1 and 2. The device is experiencing coverage issues in 5G, with the radio switching between band 12 and band 14.\n\n## Document_6\n\nWhen both the AC and USB power ports are connected to a Pepwave Transit device simultaneously, the device will share the load between the two power sources. As long as each power supply can provide sufficient current individually, it is safe to unplug and replug either power source without powering down the device.\n\n## Document_7\n\nFor the Pepwave Transit Duo Cat 12, using a single 4x4 MIMO dome antenna to serve two modems may be convenient but could potentially lessen performance compared to using two separate 2x2 MIMO antennas. It is also possible for multiple antennas to share the same ground plane, such as a large sheet of metal. The different antenna ports on the HD4-MBX Cat 18 are best tuned to different frequencies, which is a consideration for optimal performance. Regarding the spacing between separate MIMO antennas, while a recommendation of 1'-2' apart is suggested to minimize transmit interference, it may be feasible to use a smaller case if the antennas are positioned strategically, although this could affect upload speeds.\n\n## Document_8\n\nFor the Pepwave Transit Duo Cat 12, using a single 4x4 MIMO dome antenna to serve two modems may be convenient, but it could result in reduced performance compared to using two separate 2x2 MIMO antennas. Multiple antennas can share the same ground plane, such as a large sheet of metal. The different antenna ports on the HD4-MBX Cat 18 are best tuned to different frequencies, which is a consideration for optimal performance. Regarding antenna spacing, while a recommendation of 1'-2' apart is suggested for MIMO antennas to minimize interference, practical constraints such as case size and weight may necessitate closer spacing, though this could impact upload speeds due to potential transmit interference.\n\n## Document_9\n\nFor the Pepwave Transit Duo Cat 12, using a single 4x4 MIMO dome antenna to serve two modems may be convenient, but it could potentially lessen performance compared to using two separate 2x2 MIMO antennas. Multiple antennas can share the same ground plane, such as a large sheet of metal. It is suggested that the different antenna ports on the HD4-MBX Cat 18 are best tuned to different frequencies. Regarding spacing between separate MIMO antennas, while a recommendation of 1'-2' apart is given, the necessity of such distance may depend on specific installation conditions and the priority of minimizing transmit interference for upload speeds.\n\n## Document_10\n\nWhen evaluating the HD2 IP67 for deployment with AT&T and Verizon, it is noted that Band 17 is a subset of Band 12. Therefore, purchasing an LTEA model that does not explicitly support Band 17 will not result in losing AT&T connectivity, as Band 12 will still provide the necessary support.\n\n## Document_11\n\nA quick IMEI check indicated that the Verizon 150GB postpaid hotspot plan is acceptable for use with a Pepwave Transit CAT-12, while it is not acceptable for the Transit 5G model.\n\n## Document_12\n\nWhen attempting to bond multiple connections using a Pepwave Transit Cat 18 and a Pepwave Balance 20X, a link failure may occur due to SpeedFusion traffic interception. To resolve this issue, it is recommended to change the PepVPN/SpeedFusion data port on the Transit from 4500 to 5500, which may prevent the interception and allow proper traffic flow to the Balance 20X.\n\n## Document_13\n\nFor a portable internet solution suitable for events, a modified Pepwave Transit Duo Pro can be used by replacing the CAT7 modem with a CAT20 5G NR setup. This configuration allows for a stable connection using CAT20 and CAT12 modems from two different carriers. Additionally, utilizing SpeedFusion technology in a Google Cloud instance enables the teaming of the two modems for improved bandwidth and reliability.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe MAX BR1 MK2 may have connectivity issues with T-Mobile if it does not support the bands that T-Mobile is using in the area, specifically bands 7 and 12, which have been in use since July of this year. The router is currently connecting on Band 5, which may not be sufficient for reliable service in the region. The firmware version is 8.2.1.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe MAX BR1 MK2 can connect to cellular networks, but its performance may vary depending on the bands supported by the local towers. In this case, T-Mobile primarily uses bands 7 and 12 in certain areas, which the MAX BR1 MK2 may not support, leading to connectivity issues. The router was able to connect successfully in a different location, indicating that the problem may be related to the specific cellular coverage in the area where it was previously camped. The firmware version in use is 8.2.1.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe MAX BR1 MK2 may face connectivity issues with T-Mobile if it does not support the necessary bands, specifically band 7 and 12, which T-Mobile has been using in many areas since July of this year. The router is currently connecting on band 5, which may not provide adequate service in the region. The firmware version in use is 8.2.1.\n\n## Document_17\n\nFor optimal antenna connection on a Transit Max 5G, it is important to consider the type of antennas being used. The 5G modem typically utilizes two antennas for transmission and reception, while the other two are for reception only. Even with two antennas, MIMO 5G can be achieved if there are 5G base stations in the area. Additionally, it is crucial to verify the frequency bands used for 5G in the area, as older antenna models may only support frequencies up to 2.7GHz, while 5G bands may operate above 3.4GHz.\n\n## Document_18\n\nWhen considering antenna setups for the Pepwave HD4-MBX Cat 18 and Transit Duo Cat 12, it is noted that using a single 4x4 MIMO dome antenna for two modems may be convenient but could potentially lessen performance compared to using two separate 2x2 MIMO antennas. Additionally, the different antenna ports on the HD4-MBX Cat 18 can switch between various frequency bands, suggesting that frequency-dedicated antennas may not provide consistent performance. For optimal MIMO performance, it is recommended that antennas be spaced at least 7 wavelengths apart, although practical considerations may lead to compromises in spacing. Real-world testing and adjustments are often necessary to achieve the best results, as the impact of antenna placement can vary significantly.\n\n## Document_19\n\nUsing a single 4x4 MIMO dome antenna to serve two modems is not advisable in theory, particularly if both modems are using SIMs from the same carrier and frequencies, as this could lead to interference. However, many installations have successfully implemented this setup by manually setting allowed frequencies per modem. For optimal performance, it is recommended to space antennas as far apart as possible in both horizontal and vertical planes, ideally positioning them at angles between 45 to 90 degrees to each other to minimize interference and improve upload speeds.\n\n## Document_20\n\nWhen setting up antennas for a Pepwave HD4-MBX Cat 18, it is advisable to use separate 2x2 MIMO antennas rather than a single 4x4 MIMO dome antenna for each modem to avoid performance loss. Multiple antennas can share the same ground plane, but the effectiveness depends on the specific installation and potential obstructions. The different antenna ports on the HD4-MBX Cat 18 are best tuned to different frequencies, which is important for optimal performance. For spacing between separate MIMO antennas, while a recommendation of 1'-2' apart is common for reducing interference, practical considerations such as case size and layout may necessitate adjustments, though care should be taken to avoid mixing channels from different modems that could interfere with each other.\n\n## Document_21\n\nFor the Pepwave HD4-MBX Cat 18, it is suggested that different antenna ports are best tuned to different frequencies, although this is not explicitly documented elsewhere. When considering antenna configurations, using a single 4x4 MIMO dome antenna for two modems may be convenient but could potentially lessen performance compared to using two separate 2x2 MIMO antennas. Regarding antenna spacing, while a recommendation of 1'-2' apart is common to minimize interference, practical solutions have been implemented, such as mounting antennas on different levels within a single dome, which may allow for more compact setups without significant performance loss.\n\n## Document_22\n\nWhen considering antenna setups for a Pepwave Transit Duo Cat 12, using a single 4x4 MIMO dome antenna for two modems may be convenient, but it could result in reduced performance compared to using two separate 2x2 MIMO antennas.

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nThe Peplink Balance One is capable of maintaining 1 Gbps throughput, which is a significant feature for users who require high-speed internet connectivity. This performance capability is particularly important for those who prioritize speed in their networking solutions.\n\n## Document_2\n\nTo achieve higher throughput on a Peplink Balance One Core, it is recommended to perform a factory reset and only apply essential changes for testing, as unnecessary configurations can increase CPU load and decrease performance. Features like Mitigate Bufferbloat can limit speeds to ensure low latency. The Balance One Core can handle connections over 600Mbps, and users considering higher speeds may look into upgrading to the Balance 20X or the upcoming next-generation SOHO model, which is expected to be released soon.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe Peplink Balance One router is advertised with a maximum throughput of 600Mbps for Stateful Firewall, but users have reported achieving only around 300Mbps on a 1.2Gbps Comcast service, with CPU usage reaching 100% during speed tests. Testing with multiple devices and configurations, including disabling Mitigate Bufferbloat, did not improve performance. A comparison with a Firewalla Gold Plus showed it could achieve over 900Mbps. The issue may be related to specific settings or firmware versions, as one user noted a previous experience where bandwidth was halved due to an outbound policy rule using domain names, although this was on an earlier firmware version.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Peplink Balance One Core router is designed to support throughput up to 600Mbps, but users have reported varying performance levels, with one user experiencing a drop from 450Mbps to 260Mbps despite confirming that the issue is not with the ISP. The user has attempted various troubleshooting steps, including disconnecting devices, disabling PepVPN tunnels, and downgrading firmware, but the throughput remains low. Additionally, there are discrepancies in the router's specifications on different pages, with some showing a maximum throughput of 400Mbps instead of the expected 600Mbps.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe Peplink Balance One Core router is reported to provide only 200 Mbps download and upload speeds when connected via DHCP, despite the ISP offering speeds of 500 Mbps for both. To investigate this issue further, it is recommended for the customer to create a support ticket with Peplink, including the router's serial number and enabling remote assistance for troubleshooting.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Balance One router is rated for a maximum throughput of 600 Mbps, which aligns with the performance being observed by the user. The InControl2 software can be utilized independently of a Peplink router, indicating that it is not exclusive to the Balance One.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe Balance One router is rated for a maximum WAN-to-LAN throughput of up to 600Mbps. Users experiencing lower throughput, such as ~323Mbps down and up, may need to consider the impact of PPPoE and VLAN tagging on performance. For further investigation of throughput issues, it is recommended to open a support ticket with Peplink.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe Peplink Balance One and Balance One Core models are capable of supporting up to 600 Mbps routing throughput. The Balance One includes WiFi functionality, while the Balance One Core does not. This information is relevant for users experiencing lower speed test results through Peplink devices compared to direct connections to their ISP's router.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe Peplink Balance One has a router throughput of 400 mb/s, which refers to the combined total throughput of all WAN connections in Load Balance mode. Therefore, it cannot achieve a maximum download speed of 525 mb/s with three 175 mb/s connections. For achieving higher speeds, the Peplink Balance 305 is recommended as it can support the necessary throughput for three WAN connections.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Peplink Balance One has a router throughput of 400 mb/s when using three WAN connections in Load Balance mode, meaning that the maximum combined download speed achievable is 400 mb/s, not the sum of the individual WAN speeds (525 mb/s). To achieve higher speeds, one option is to use a second dual-WAN router to create additional WAN interfaces, allowing for a total of four WAN connections, although one would be used to route traffic between the two routers.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Peplink Balance One has a maximum throughput of 400 mb/s when using three WAN connections in Load Balance mode, meaning that the combined download speeds will not exceed this limit. To achieve a total download speed of 525 mb/s with three 175 mbps connections, a more robust solution would be required, such as using two Balance One Core units to aggregate bandwidth effectively. This setup involves connecting two WANs to one Balance Core unit and the third WAN to another Balance Core unit, allowing for better management of the aggregated bandwidth.\n\n## Document_12\n\nFor achieving a throughput of 400 Mbps with two WAN lines of 200 Mbps each, the Peplink Balance One is suitable for environments with fewer than 60 users, while the Balance 305 or higher models are recommended for more than 60 users.\n\n## Document_13\n\nFor a small co-op WISP using Peplink, the Balance One is suitable for 1-60 users, but the Balance 305 is recommended for deployments with potential growth beyond that. The throughput ratings for Peplink devices are based on the total upload and download speeds across all WAN connections, which is important to consider if both WANs are used simultaneously or if bandwidth needs increase in the future. The Peplink software allows for VLAN configurations and NAT for static public IP assignments, although specific static IP assignments to VLANs may not be directly visible in the software.\n\n## Document_14\n\nWhen considering a Peplink Balance router for a network of about 80 users, the Balance One is rated for 1Gbps throughput but recommended for only up to 50 users. The Balance 305 is the least expensive model rated for the required number of users, with a throughput of 200Mbps, which is close to the current 150Mbps internet connection. Key factors for sizing include the number of WAN links, available WAN bandwidth, SpeedFusion VPN usage, and the type of traffic over SpeedFusion. The Balance One can handle a high number of concurrent sessions, tested up to 5000, but lacks some enterprise features found in higher models like the Balance 305 and 380, which include hardware high availability support, advanced AP controller functionality, and QoS user groups.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Peplink Balance One router, with a throughput of 1Gbps, is recommended for smaller environments (1-50 users) due to its ability to handle fewer concurrent sessions compared to larger models like the Peplink 305, which is designed for 50-500 users and has a throughput of 200Mbps. The Balance One is suitable for smaller branches or remote power users with high-speed internet connections, while larger units are intended for enterprise offices that require support for more concurrent users and sessions.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe Peplink B One series supports a 1 Gbps throughput and is suitable for small businesses, but certain features like RADIUS and LDAP authentication for VPN are only available in higher-end models such as the Balance 210 and above. Users have reported issues with the accuracy of product specifications, as features listed in manuals and datasheets may not be available in the actual devices. The Balance 310 5G Fiber model is recommended for normal business use due to its ability to handle a full 1 Gbps fiber connection with all features enabled. Users have experienced stability issues with firmware versions, particularly with the Balance 310, which requires specific firmware to avoid frequent lockups. Additionally, using AWS EC2 for hosting FusionHub is suggested as a better alternative to Vultr due to networking issues.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe Peplink Balance One router is advertised with a maximum Stateful Firewall Throughput of 600Mbps, but users have reported achieving only around 300Mbps with their Comcast 1.2Gbps service, indicating a significant performance discrepancy. Testing revealed that the CPU usage peaks at 100% during speed tests at 300Mbps, suggesting that the router may be struggling to handle the throughput. In contrast, a Firewalla Gold Plus can achieve speeds of 900Mbps or more with the same modem. Additionally, the Balance One was tested with various configurations, including disabling Mitigate Bufferbloat and testing different firmware versions, but no improvement was observed. A Surf Soho router achieved speeds consistent with its specifications, indicating that the Balance One may be underperforming compared to its rated capabilities.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Peplink Balance One router is experiencing throughput issues, achieving only around 300Mbps on a 1.2Gbps Comcast service, despite being rated for 600Mbps Stateful Firewall Throughput. Testing revealed that the CPU reaches 100% during speed tests, indicating potential performance limitations. Disabling the Mitigate Bufferbloat feature did not improve download speeds, and testing with different firmware versions yielded no significant changes. In contrast, a Firewalla Gold Plus modem achieved over 900Mbps with the same setup. Additionally, a Surf Soho router performed as expected at 123Mbps, suggesting that the Balance One may not be functioning optimally. The Balance20X also reported similar performance issues, with upload speeds significantly lower than expected, and other services like CCTV and VPN access were not functioning properly, although LAN downloads reached full speed.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe Peplink Balance One router is experiencing a maximum throughput of around 300Mbps despite being rated for 600Mbps Stateful Firewall Throughput. This issue persists across multiple units and firmware versions, with CPU utilization reaching 100% during speed tests. Testing with a Firewalla Gold Plus shows it can achieve over 900Mbps with the same modem. The user has also tested various configurations, including disabling Mitigate Bufferbloat and using different routers, with the Surf Soho achieving its rated throughput. For better bandwidth management, alternatives like the Balance 580 or 580X are suggested, or using synergy mode to combine multiple routers for enhanced WAN capabilities.\n\n## Document_20\n\nTo achieve better throughput on the Peplink Balance One router, it is recommended to use the Edge browser on Windows 10 for speed tests, configure speedtest.net to use a Single Connection instead of Multi Connection, and avoid logging into the Balance One during testing to reduce CPU usage. This approach resulted in a maximum download speed of 600Mbps and upload speeds reaching 567Mbps, indicating that CPU load and browser choice can significantly impact performance during speed tests.\n\n## Document_21\n\nAfter experiencing a drop in throughput on a Balance One Core router from 450Mbps to 260Mbps, a factory reset restored the bandwidth to over 450Mbps. The issue was identified as being related to the Quality of Service (QoS) settings; enabling any QoS setting resulted in a significant reduction in bandwidth, effectively cutting it in half. This behavior raises concerns about whether it is a design choice or a firmware bug, suggesting that it should be clearly documented for users.\n\n## Document_22\n\nUsers have reported a significant drop in throughput on the Balance One router, with speeds decreasing from approximately 450Mbps to around 260Mbps despite direct connections to the cable modem achieving close to 500Mbps. Troubleshooting steps included disabling PepVPN tunnels, adjusting QoS settings, and modifying WAN connection buffer sizes without resolving the issue. The Balance One's CPU usage during speed tests was noted to be between 50% and 75%. The setup involved multiple Peplink AP One Minis, VLANs, and WAN connections, but no specific settings were identified as the cause of the slowdown.\n\n## Document_23\n\nA user experienced a drop in throughput on a Pepwave Balance One Core router from approximately 450Mbps to 260Mbps despite having a direct connection to the cable modem that achieved close to 500Mbps. Troubleshooting revealed that a specific QoS setting under Network->QoS->Application, where Remote Desktop was set to High Priority, was causing the bandwidth reduction. Removing this setting restored expected bandwidth performance.\n\n## Document_24\n\nThe user is experiencing a significant drop in throughput on a Pepwave Balance One Core router after upgrading firmware from version 8.0.0 to 8.0.1, with speeds dropping from 480Mbps to around 240Mbps. Testing revealed that the issue is related to firmware changes, particularly between versions 8.0.0 and 8.0.1. The user noted several features introduced in 8.0.1 that could potentially impact performance, including Fast Roaming support, Local Service Inbound Firewall, and changes to SNMP. The user also mentioned that other users have reported QoS settings affecting performance. Further testing is planned with the latest firmware version and a factory reset to identify the cause of the issue.\n\n## Document_25\n\nThe Balance One Core router can experience a significant drop in throughput, as evidenced by a user reporting a decrease from 450Mbps to 260Mbps despite having a direct connection to the cable modem yielding close to 500Mbps. Troubleshooting steps included unplugging devices, disabling PepVPN tunnels, and downgrading firmware to version 8.0.1, but the issue persisted. Another user reported different throughput results with untagged LAN at 550Mbps and VLAN 10 at 270Mbps, indicating potential configuration issues or limitations related to VLAN settings, even after resetting the device to factory defaults.\n\n## Document_26\n\nWhen using a Peplink Balance One with CenturyLink fiber, enabling PPPoE and VLAN tagging can significantly reduce throughput, with reported speeds around 323Mbps down and up. However, when the Peplink is connected as a child device to the CenturyLink router and both PPPoE and VLAN tagging are removed, throughput improves to approximately 550-560Mbps down and 700Mbps up. High CPU utilization (100%) during speed tests suggests that the Balance One may struggle with gigabit throughput, indicating it may not be optimized for such speeds.\n\n## Document_27\n\nThe Balance One router is experiencing throughput limitations on WAN to LAN connections, with reported speeds of approximately 323Mbps down and up when connected to a CenturyLink fiber service with PPPoE and VLAN tagging enabled. In contrast, a direct connection to the CenturyLink router yields speeds of 900Mbps down and up. Another user reports achieving 400Mbps down and 250Mbps up with the Balance One, while a competitor's product provides higher speeds of 700Mbps down and 600Mbps up under similar conditions. This suggests potential optimization issues or limitations with the Balance One's handling of PPPoE and VLAN configurations.\n\n## Document_28\n\nTo troubleshoot low throughput on a Pepwave Balance One when using a CenturyLink fiber connection with PPPoE and VLAN tagging, it is suggested to test with a beta firmware version (6.2.1s011) that includes performance tweaks. The user should conduct throughput tests multiple times to assess performance changes. The current setup shows a maximum throughput of approximately 323Mb down and up, while a direct connection through the CenturyLink router achieves around 900Mb down and up, indicating potential issues with the Balance One's handling of VLAN tagging or PPPoE.\n\n",

This issue persists across multiple units and firmware versions, with CPU utilization reaching 100% during speed tests. Testing with a Firewalla Gold Plus shows it can achieve over 900Mbps with the same modem. The user has also tested various configurations, including disabling Mitigate Bufferbloat and using different routers, with the Surf Soho achieving its rated throughput. For better bandwidth management, alternatives like the Balance 580 or 580X are suggested, or using synergy mode to combine multiple routers for enhanced WAN capabilities.",
      "To achieve better throughput on the Peplink Balance One router, it is recommended to use the Edge browser on Windows 10 for speed tests, configure speedtest.net to use a Single Connection instead of Multi Connection, and avoid logging into the Balance One during testing to reduce CPU usage. This approach resulted in a maximum download speed of 600Mbps and upload speeds reaching 567Mbps, indicating that CPU load and browser choice can significantly impact performance during speed tests.",
      "After experiencing a drop in throughput on a Balance One Core router from 450Mbps to 260Mbps, a factory reset restored the bandwidth to over 450Mbps. The issue was identified as being related to the Quality of Service (QoS) settings; enabling any QoS setting resulted in a significant reduction in bandwidth, effectively cutting it in half. This behavior raises concerns about whether it is a design choice or a firmware bug, suggesting that it should be clearly documented for users.",
      "Users have reported a significant drop in throughput on the Balance One router, with speeds decreasing from approximately 450Mbps to around 260Mbps despite direct connections to the cable modem achieving close to 500Mbps. Troubleshooting steps included disabling PepVPN tunnels, adjusting QoS settings, and modifying WAN connection buffer sizes without resolving the issue.

    "query": "How do configuration choices such as QoS settings, VLAN tagging, and PPPoE influence the achievable throughput on the Peplink Balance One/Core, and what troubleshooting steps have been shown to restore or improve performance in these scenarios?",
    "answer": "QoS settings, VLAN tagging, and PPPoE can all significantly reduce the achievable throughput on the Peplink Balance One/Core. Enabling QoS features or certain application priorities (like setting Remote Desktop to High Priority) can cut throughput by up to half, as observed by users who saw bandwidth drop from over 450Mbps to about 260Mbps; removing or resetting these settings restored performance. Similarly, enabling both PPPoE and VLAN tagging on fiber connections can reduce throughput to around 323Mbps, while removing these features and connecting the router as a child device to the ISP's router allows for much higher speeds (over 550Mbps). High CPU utilization during speed tests (often reaching 100%) is a common indicator that the router is struggling with these features enabled. Troubleshooting steps that have restored or improved performance include performing a factory reset, disabling or adjusting QoS settings, downgrading or upgrading firmware, removing VLAN tagging and PPPoE when possible, and testing with different firmware versions (including beta releases).",

If the problem continues, check the Status > Event Log for any time sync failures, which may indicate issues with the DNS server configured on WAN interfaces or the NTP server settings.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Peplink Balance Series does not support TR-069, but users can manage their devices using InControl2, which is Peplink's network management solution.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 and 30 routers are rated for 100 Mbps of throughput, which includes both upload and download speeds. They support various types of WAN connections, including Ethernet and USB, although some USB connections may require a firmware update. The Balance series is designed to handle multiple WAN connections, ensuring seamless failover in case one connection drops.\n\n## Document_6\n\nIn a network configuration involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 routers connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is important to ensure that outbound rules are correctly set up for traffic to traverse from the satellite sites to Azure. The Balance 508 needs to properly advertise its routes to the connected 305 devices for successful end-to-end connectivity.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe outbound policy configuration on the PepLink Balance 508 was successfully adjusted, allowing the connected Balance 305 devices to traverse to Azure through the established IP Sec VPN tunnels. This indicates that proper routing and policy settings are essential for enabling connectivity between satellite sites and Azure.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe Peplink Balance 300, which is approximately 15 years old, supports a maximum throughput of 20Mbps. Therefore, if clients are experiencing a maximum speed of 15Mbps, this is within the expected performance limits of the device, despite having three WAN connections with a total potential speed of 300Mbps.\n\n## Document_9\n\nEnabling VLANs on a Balance 1350 router does not cause any downtime, allowing for configuration changes without interrupting the network service.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo set up a Point to Point PepLink VPN tunnel between Balance 210-A and Balance 210-C, it is important to note that a custom handshake port feature is not currently available. The handshake port is global to all profiles on the device and cannot be set through the existing PepVPN management UI.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe latest firmware for the Peplink Balance 20W is v4.8.1, and this model has been obsoleted. Users are advised to consider refreshing their router for updated features and support.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo configure a Peplink Balance 20/30 for a network with multiple workstations and servers, the custom outbound policy manager can be utilized to create rules that direct specific workstations to use WAN2 while all other traffic uses WAN1. This can be achieved through the Priority or Enforced algorithm. Additionally, time-based rules for scheduling traffic management have been requested and are on the development roadmap, although no estimated time of arrival (ETA) has been provided.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Peplink Balance e30 is not a DSL modem and does not have RJ11 ports; it only features RJ45 Ethernet ports. To connect the Balance router to an ADSL connection, a separate DSL modem is required that provides an Ethernet output to connect to the Balance's WAN port.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe Peplink Balance 1350 supports only one VLAN, necessitating a layer 3 switch for additional VLAN configurations. With firmware release 6.1, multiple LAN subnets will be supported. The Balance 1350 can manage up to 20 access points (APs) without an additional license, while a license is required for controlling between 21 and 500 APs. The device is scalable and can handle over 5000 users, accommodating future growth needs.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Balance 380 has a router throughput rating of 200 Mbps, which indicates that the combined WAN upload and download speeds can potentially exceed this limit, leading to undesirable behavior. Although the router should sustain 75 Mbps of throughput, high CPU load can occur under certain conditions, affecting performance and causing issues such as failed admin page requests and internet unavailability for other users. It is advisable to open a support ticket for further investigation.\n\n## Document_16\n\nWhen encountering an 'invalid Incontrol host' message while migrating an access point on a Privately Hosted IC2 appliance, it is advisable to check for any trailing spaces in the IP address. Removing any such spaces may resolve the issue and allow successful migration.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe MediaFast 500 supports all 8 load balancing algorithms, contrary to the initial impression that it only supports 7. This indicates that the specifications for the MediaFast family may not be fully representative of its capabilities regarding load balancing algorithms.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Balance 20 and 30 routers have the same technical specifications, with the primary difference being that the Balance 30 includes an additional WAN port. The Balance 210 offers advantages such as support for a greater number of users, a more extensive list of Outbound Load Balancing options (7 options compared to 5 on the 20/30), and increased VPN capabilities not available on the 20 or 30 models. All models support multi-WAN configurations and can accommodate various internet connections including cable, DSL, and 3G/4G.\n\n## Document_19\n\nBoth the Peplink Balance 20 and Balance 30 can be configured for 2 Ethernet connections, while the Balance 30 supports 3 Ethernet connections. Additionally, both models allow for 1 USB 3G/4G connection, which can be set up for backup use through Outbound Policy or WAN status. Users can also implement a bandwidth cap on the USB/Mobile connection to disable it upon reaching a monthly data allowance.\n\n## Document_20\n\nIn a network configuration involving PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is noted that IP Sec tunnels do not typically advertise their routes through second hops. To enable connectivity from satellite sites to Azure, a static route for the Azure subnet can be added on the satellite devices, pointing to the Balance 508. Additionally, firewall configurations on both the satellite sites and Azure may need to be reviewed to ensure they allow the necessary traffic exchange.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo enable connectivity from PepLink Balance 305 devices to Azure through a Balance 508, static routes can be configured on the Balance 305 for the Azure subnet, using the Balance 508 as the gateway. Additionally, the Azure configuration should include a static route for the Balance 305 subnet, also using the Balance 508 as the gateway. It is important to ensure that firewall rules on both ends permit this routing to function correctly.\n\n## Document_22\n\nIn a network setup involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via a star topology, issues may arise with route advertisement to Azure through IP Sec VPN tunnels. The Balance 508 may not be advertising its routes to the connected Balance 305 devices, which can prevent satellite sites from accessing Azure. Additionally, static routes may need to connect to gateways within the same subnet, which can complicate configurations if sites are not willing to share a common subnet.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe Balance 300 router supports a maximum throughput of 20mbps per user, despite having three WAN connections each capable of 100mbps. This means that while the total potential speed from the WAN connections is 300mbps, the router's limitations restrict the actual usable speed to 20mbps per user, indicating that the additional bandwidth from the WAN connections is not utilized effectively.\n\n## Document_24\n\nTo set up a Point to Point PepLink VPN tunnel between Balance 210-A and Balance 210-C, it is necessary to use custom handshake and data ports for PepVPN on Balance 210-C. These ports must be forwarded through Balance 210-B. The PepVPN profile on Balance 210-A should be configured to connect to the public IP of Balance 210-B using the specified custom ports.\n\n## Document_25\n\nTo connect a Peplink Balance e30 to an ADSL connection, the DSL router should be configured in Bridge mode to allow the Peplink to handle the PPPoE authentication. If the DSL router is set to authenticate, the Peplink WAN must be configured to either specify an IP address or to automatically obtain an address from the DSL router.\n\n## Document_26\n\nThe Peplink 1350 supports multi VLAN configurations, allowing separate subnets for each wireless SSID, which can be defined in version 6.1, currently in beta and expected to be released by the end of the year. Bandwidth limitations can be set for each SSID in the current version. User management for access control can be handled through an external RADIUS server, with the number of users manageable depending on the capabilities of the RADIUS software used.\n\n",

    "query": "How do throughput limitations and WAN interface options differ among Peplink Balance 20, Balance 30, Balance 300, and Balance 20X models, and what are the practical impacts of these differences for a home or small business with multiple devices?",
    "answer": "The Balance 20 and Balance 30 both have a throughput limit of 100 Mbps, with the primary difference being that the Balance 30 has an extra WAN port, supporting 3 Ethernet WANs versus 2 on the Balance 20. Both models also support 1 USB 3G/4G WAN for backup, and a bandwidth cap can be set on the USB interface to manage data usage. The Balance 300 is significantly older and limited to a maximum throughput of 20 Mbps, regardless of having three 100 Mbps WAN connections; its hardware restricts usable speed per user and in aggregate. The Balance 20X, in contrast, provides up to 900 Mbps throughput, making it suitable for modern home or small business networks with many devices (PCs, NAS, smart devices) demanding higher speeds. In practice, using a Balance 300 would result in much slower internet performance for all connected users, even if your internet connections are faster. The Balance 20 and 30 allow for full use of 100 Mbps connections, but would bottleneck if your ISP provides higher speeds. The Balance 20X avoids these limitations, enabling much higher aggregate speeds and better support for multiple devices with high bandwidth needs.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nThe Peplink Balance 380 HW5 has a maximum router throughput of 200Mbps, which is insufficient given the combined WAN speeds of 200Mbps, 150Mbps, and 120Mbps. The device is experiencing saturation at 150Mbps due to its limitations. For improved performance, it is recommended to upgrade to a newer model, such as the Balance 380 HW6, which supports 1Gbps Stateful Firewall Throughput.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe Peplink Balance 380 HWR 5 is not capable of supporting a 1Gbps WAN connection, which is why the user is experiencing a maximum speed of 323 Mbps. To achieve the desired speeds, an upgrade to a HWR 6 version of the Balance 380 is necessary.\n\n## Document_3\n\nHardware Revision 1 of the Peplink Balance 380 features 10/100 Ethernet ports, which are capable of operating at 100 Mbps Full Duplex, allowing for a total throughput of up to 200 Mbps of data traffic. Despite the 10/100 labeling, the router's throughput is rated at 170 Mbps.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Peplink Balance 380 features 3 WAN ports that support 10/100/1000 Base-T Ethernet connectivity, which indicates that each port can handle up to 1 Gbps bandwidth. However, the overall router's throughput is limited to a maximum of 170 Mbps, which does not reflect the individual port capabilities.\n\n## Document_5\n\nFor achieving a minimum throughput of 1.9 Gbps with high-speed connections like 940/940 Fiber and 1000/20 Cable, the Peplink Balance 380X is a suitable option as it has a firewall throughput of 3 Gbps. However, there are concerns regarding the lack of clarity on IPv6 support from Peplink, which has not been addressed for over three years. The Balance 380, on the other hand, only supports a firewall throughput of 1 Gbps, making it unsuitable for the desired specifications.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Peplink Balance 380 (HW.5) has a maximum throughput that limits performance to around 290 Mbps for speed tests, while the Balance 380 (HW.6) can achieve up to 900 Mbps. The user is experiencing high CPU usage (100%) during speed tests, which may contribute to the lower throughput observed. The MTU settings tested (1440, 1500, 1530, and 1580) did not improve the speed beyond 290 Mbps, indicating that the issue may not be solely related to MTU configuration.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe Peplink Balance 310 has a maximum throughput of 200 Mbps, which limits the ability to aggregate multiple WAN connections to achieve higher speeds. However, using a more recent model like the Balance 380 or 305 could allow for up to 1 Gbps throughput, provided that the ISPs are balanced equally. To achieve a combined speed of 600 Mbps with three 200 Mbps connections, traffic must consist of separate concurrent sessions that can be distributed evenly across the WANs by the balancing algorithms.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe Peplink Balance 380 has varying throughput limitations depending on the hardware version. The throughput for hardware versions 1 through 4 is 170 Mbps, for hardware version 5 it is 200 Mbps, and for hardware version 6 it supports up to 1 Gbps.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe current hardware revisions of the Peplink Balance 305 (HW rev 2) and Balance 380 (HW rev 6) support 1 Gbps throughput on the WAN ports, which includes the total of all WANs' upload and download speeds.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Peplink Balance 380 and Balance 580 have specific hardware revisions that affect their performance, including router throughput and SpeedFusion throughput. For the latest specifications, users can refer to the Peplink model comparison page for detailed information on these devices.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Peplink Balance One has a router throughput of 400 mb/s when using three WAN connections in Load Balance mode, meaning that the maximum combined download speed achievable is 400 mb/s, not the sum of the individual WAN speeds (525 mb/s). To achieve higher speeds, one option is to use a second dual-WAN router to create additional WAN interfaces, allowing for a total of four WAN connections, although one would be used to route traffic between the two routers.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe Peplink Balance One has a maximum throughput of 400 mb/s when using three WAN connections in Load Balance mode, meaning that the combined download speeds will not exceed this limit. To achieve a total download speed of 525 mb/s with three 175 mbps connections, a more robust solution would be required, such as using two Balance One Core units to aggregate bandwidth effectively. This setup involves connecting two WANs to one Balance Core unit and the third WAN to another Balance Core unit, allowing for better management of the aggregated bandwidth.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe older revisions of the Peplink Balance 380 support up to 200Mbps of throughput. For issues related to lower throughput, it is recommended to open a support ticket for further investigation.\n\n## Document_14\n\nWhen using a Peplink Balance 380, if the WAN settings are default and the speed tests show significantly lower speeds compared to a direct connection to the modem, it may be necessary to investigate the configuration of the router. The user has already replaced cables and a hub without improvement, indicating that the issue may lie within the router settings or capabilities. Testing the connection directly to the modem yielded speeds of 934.78 Mbps, while the router consistently showed speeds between 263.93 Mbps and 306.02 Mbps. Further adjustments to the router settings may be needed to optimize performance.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Peplink Balance 380 has three Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) WAN ports, which means that each of these ports can support up to 1 Gbps bandwidth. Additionally, it has one GbE LAN port and four 10/100 Base-T Ethernet ports, which support lower bandwidths.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo achieve over 1Gb/sec for a single client, it is necessary to have 10Gb networking between the router and the client, as LACP (802.3ad) will not allow a single client to consume 2Gbps. LACP is designed to load balance flows across multiple physical links, but the speed of any single flow will be limited to the line rate of individual network ports. For a home setup with a combination of connections, the Balance Two is suggested as a viable option.\n\n## Document_17\n\nFor achieving high throughput close to 1.9 Gbps with dual high-speed connections (940/940 Fiber and 1000/20 Cable), the Peplink Balance 310X and Balance 380X are considered suitable options. The Balance 310X may not utilize its LTE capabilities, while the Balance 380X supports multiple WAN connections and is preferred for setups requiring LACP (802.3ad) to allow a single client to consume full bandwidth. The Balance 380X is also noted for its ability to support 3-4 WANs, making it a versatile choice for high-speed internet setups.\n\n## Document_18\n\nFor achieving high throughput close to 1.9 Gbps with dual high-speed connections, the Peplink Balance 310X is a suitable option, although its LTE features may go unused. The Balance 380 is another potential choice, but it is more expensive. Additionally, the BR1 PRO 5G features a 2.5 Gbps WAN port, indicating that newer devices may support higher speeds as chipsets evolve.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe Peplink Balance 380 (HW.5, FW 6.2.2 build 3362) is rated for 200 Mbps, but the user is experiencing speeds of 290 Mbps on a gigabit WAN circuit. However, the CPU usage spikes to 100% during speed tests, causing the command line interface to become non-responsive. The user has tested various MTU settings (1440, 1500, 1530, and 1580) without improvement in speed, and the upload/download bandwidth is correctly set to 1 Gbps.\n\n## Document_20\n\nWhen experiencing lower than expected speeds on a Peplink Balance 380 with a gigabit WAN connection, it is important to check the device's CPU usage, as high CPU spikes (up to 100%) during speed tests can affect performance. Additionally, ensuring that the Upload/Download bandwidth settings are correctly configured to 1 Gbps and verifying the MTU settings, which auto-configures to 1500, are also crucial steps in troubleshooting the issue.\n\n## Document_21\n\nWhen conducting speed tests on a Peplink Balance 380 with a gigabit WAN connection, if the results show significantly lower speeds (e.g., 290x290 Mbps) compared to a direct connection to a laptop (e.g., 910x910 Mbps), it may indicate an MTU issue or CPU overload. Testing various MTU sizes (1440, 1500, 1530, and 1580) did not yield improvements in speed. The CPU of the Peplink Balance 380 spikes to 100% during speed tests, causing the command line interface to become non-responsive. It is recommended to connect the client device directly to the LAN port of the Balance 380 for accurate testing.\n\n## Document_22\n\nWhen experiencing lower than expected speeds on a Peplink Balance 380 with a gigabit WAN connection, it is important to check the MTU settings, although testing various MTU sizes (1440, 1500, 1530, and 1580) did not yield improvements in this case. High CPU usage (spiking to 100%) during speed tests can affect performance, leading to non-responsiveness in the command line interface. Additionally, the configuration should ensure that the upload/download bandwidth is set correctly to 1 Gbps and that Dynamic DNS (DDNS) is utilized in the WAN settings due to the absence of static public IPs.\n\n## Document_23\n\nWhen experiencing lower than expected speeds on a Peplink Balance 380 with a gigabit WAN connection, potential causes could include MTU settings and CPU performance. Testing various MTU sizes (1440, 1500, 1530, and 1580) did not yield improvements beyond 290x290 Mbps. The CPU usage spikes to 100% during speed tests, causing the command line interface to become non-responsive. It is confirmed that the upload/download bandwidth is set to 1 Gbps, and the auto MTU is set to 1500.\n\n",

    "query": "A technician is troubleshooting why a Peplink Balance 380 router with a gigabit WAN circuit achieves only around 290 Mbps throughput during speed tests, despite correct bandwidth and MTU settings. What are the most likely causes for this bottleneck, and how do hardware revision limitations and CPU usage factor into the observed performance?",
    "answer": "The most likely causes of the observed throughput bottleneck (around 290 Mbps) on a Peplink Balance 380 with a gigabit WAN circuit are hardware revision limitations and high CPU usage during speed tests. Hardware versions of the Balance 380 prior to HW6 are limited to lower maximum throughput rates (170–200 Mbps), and while some users observe up to 290 Mbps, this is above the official rating and likely represents a practical ceiling under optimal conditions. High CPU utilization (100%) during speed tests is also reported, which causes the router interface to become non-responsive and further limits achievable speeds. Testing different MTU values (1440, 1500, 1530, 1580) does not improve throughput, ruling out MTU misconfiguration as the bottleneck. The CPU overload during high-bandwidth use is a direct consequence of the hardware's processing limits. To achieve gigabit speeds, upgrading to a newer hardware revision (HW6 or newer), which officially supports up to 1 Gbps throughput, is necessary.",

Omnidirectional antennas are recommended for RVs because they do not require aiming and can maintain connectivity while in motion. For optimal signal quality, antennas should be mounted as high as possible and above deck, ideally with a separation of 1.5 meters between antennas to reduce interference and enhance MIMO performance. Cable runs should be kept as short as possible, using high-quality cables (e.g., LM400) to minimize dB loss per foot and maintain signal strength. The BR1 Mini supports Cat 6 carrier aggregation for improved throughput and requires a full-size SIM designed for routers. Additionally, the device can be configured for failover and GPS tracking, with the GPS antenna included in the Puma 221. Proper antenna installation and cable management directly impact the achievable download speeds and overall connectivity reliability in mobile environments like RVs.",

Users can select between connecting to the primary SIMs (A/B) or the SpeedFusion Connect (SFConnect).\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe Pepwave Transit models with Cat 12 modems support download speeds of up to 600 Mbps, while those with Cat 6 modems support speeds of up to 300 Mbps. The newest 'Pro' versions of the Pepwave Transit are equipped with Cat 12 modems.\n\n## Document_3\n\nTo activate a Pepwave Transit Mini with carriers like AT&T, it may be necessary to use a carrier-supplied hotspot device to activate the hotspot SIM. If one does not have access to such a device, purchasing a compatible hotspot from a secondary market, such as eBay, may be a viable option for activation.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe issue of GPS location updates failing on Pepwave devices may be related to the GPS antenna rather than the devices themselves. Users have reported intermittent functionality with both a 7 in 1 antenna and the GPS antenna provided with the Transit DUO and Transit Pro. The GPS signal may resume after rebooting the router, suggesting potential reliability issues with the antennas. For persistent problems, it is recommended to download a diagnostic file from the status page and submit a ticket to Peplink engineering for further investigation.\n\n## Document_5\n\nFor the Pepwave Transit Duo Cat 12, using a single 4x4 MIMO dome antenna to serve two modems may be convenient but could potentially lessen performance compared to using two separate 2x2 MIMO antennas. It is also possible for multiple antennas to share the same ground plane, such as a large sheet of metal. The different antenna ports on the HD4-MBX Cat 18 are best tuned to different frequencies, which is a consideration for optimal performance. Regarding the spacing between separate MIMO antennas, while a recommendation of 1'-2' apart is suggested to minimize transmit interference, it may be feasible to use a smaller case if the antennas are positioned strategically, although this could affect upload speeds.\n\n## Document_6\n\nFor the Pepwave Transit Duo Cat 12, using a single 4x4 MIMO dome antenna to serve two modems may be convenient, but it could result in reduced performance compared to using two separate 2x2 MIMO antennas.

The response suggests clarifying the specific model of the Transit device, noting that the Transit 5G is an older model no longer available for new purchases, while the Transit Duo would not support 5G and is limited to 2xCAT12. Additionally, checking the firmware version, with the current version being 8.3.0, is recommended for troubleshooting.\n\n## Document_10\n\nA quick IMEI check indicated that the Verizon 150GB postpaid hotspot plan is acceptable for use with a Pepwave Transit CAT-12, while it is not acceptable for the Transit 5G model.\n\n## Document_11\n\nTo use a Google Fi SIM card in a Pepwave Transit Cat-18, one must first establish a voice line with Google Fi, after which additional data-only lines can be added to the account. The SIM cards for voice lines are white, while data-only SIM cards are yellow.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThere is conflicting information regarding the compatibility of the AT&T unlimited elite plan with the Pepwave MAX Transit Cat-18. Users have reported varying experiences, with some stating it works well while others mention potential IMEI locking issues. Additionally, a user experienced disconnections due to tower maintenance but found stability after the work was completed. They also switched from using SmartCheck to HTTP, suggesting that AT&T may prefer web browsing activity for connection stability.\n\n## Document_13\n\nWhen attempting to bond multiple connections using a Pepwave Transit Cat 18 and a Pepwave Balance 20X, a link failure may occur due to SpeedFusion traffic interception. To resolve this issue, it is recommended to change the PepVPN/SpeedFusion data port on the Transit from 4500 to 5500, which may prevent the interception and allow proper traffic flow to the Balance 20X.\n\n## Document_14\n\nFor a portable internet solution suitable for events, a modified Pepwave Transit Duo Pro can be used by replacing the CAT7 modem with a CAT20 5G NR setup. This configuration allows for a stable connection using CAT20 and CAT12 modems from two different carriers. Additionally, utilizing SpeedFusion technology in a Google Cloud instance enables the teaming of the two modems for improved bandwidth and reliability.\n\n## Document_15\n\nA VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) allows multiple networks to coexist on the same networking hardware while keeping traffic logically separated. This logical segmentation avoids the need for physical separation of networks, enabling control over communication between devices and networks. To configure a guest VLAN in Pepwave, access the network tab in the web administration interface, change the default IP address to a unique number within the range of 1 to 254, and set the subnet mask to 255.255.255.0. The DHCP range must be defined to automatically assign IP addresses to devices. The VLAN should be assigned to a specific Ethernet LAN port, and if Wi-Fi access is needed, the SSID must be configured with a name and security settings, including a password. Changes must be saved and applied to ensure the configuration takes effect.\n\n## Document_16\n\nWhen considering antenna setups for the Pepwave HD4-MBX Cat 18 and Transit Duo Cat 12, it is noted that using a single 4x4 MIMO dome antenna for two modems may be convenient but could potentially lessen performance compared to using two separate 2x2 MIMO antennas. Additionally, the different antenna ports on the HD4-MBX Cat 18 can switch between various frequency bands, suggesting that frequency-dedicated antennas may not provide consistent performance. For optimal MIMO performance, it is recommended that antennas be spaced at least 7 wavelengths apart, although practical considerations may lead to compromises in spacing. Real-world testing and adjustments are often necessary to achieve the best results, as the impact of antenna placement can vary significantly.\n\n## Document_17\n\nUsing a single 4x4 MIMO dome antenna to serve two modems is not advisable in theory, particularly if both modems are using SIMs from the same carrier and frequencies, as this could lead to interference. However, many installations have successfully implemented this setup by manually setting allowed frequencies per modem. For optimal performance, it is recommended to space antennas as far apart as possible in both horizontal and vertical planes, ideally positioning them at angles between 45 to 90 degrees to each other to minimize interference and improve upload speeds.\n\n## Document_18\n\nWhen setting up antennas for a Pepwave HD4-MBX Cat 18, it is advisable to use separate 2x2 MIMO antennas rather than a single 4x4 MIMO dome antenna for each modem to avoid performance loss. Multiple antennas can share the same ground plane, but the effectiveness depends on the specific installation and potential obstructions.

To update the cellular firmware on the Transit mini, users can modify the address bar from index.cgi to support.cgi, and it is suggested to try the beta firmware available through Peplink's open beta program.\n\n## Document_22\n\nThe Pepwave MAX Transit model currently does not support dual 5G modules, as there are no existing models with such capabilities. For issues with a Pepwave device showing incorrect carrier information, it is suggested to manually select the APN settings, changing from 'Auto' to 'Broadband' to ensure proper connection to the intended cellular network. This adjustment may help resolve issues related to SIM card recognition and connectivity, especially in remote areas where specific settings are necessary for optimal performance.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe MAX Transit 5G (MAX-TST-5GD-T-PRM) is expected to be Verizon certified as of September 2021, which indicates compatibility with Verizon's services, including their new 150GB postpaid hotspot plan.\n\n## Document_24\n\nThe Verizon 150GB postpaid hotspot plan is compatible with Peplink Pepwave devices, and users have reported that it functions effectively for their needs.\n\n## Document_25\n\nThe Verizon 150GB postpaid hotspot plan is compatible with the Pepwave MAX Transit Duo. To use the plan, the hotspot device's IMEI can be switched to the IMEI of the Transit Duo without needing a new ICCID.\n\n## Document_26\n\nThe $55 100GB AT&T prepaid plan works well with the Pepwave MAX Transit Cat 18, and the user provided the IMEI during the signup process. However, there is uncertainty regarding the compatibility of the AT&T unlimited elite plan with the device.\n\n",

    "query": "What are the key considerations and trade-offs when setting up antennas for a Pepwave Transit Duo Cat 12 or HD4-MBX Cat 18, particularly regarding the use of a single 4x4 MIMO dome antenna versus two separate 2x2 MIMO antennas, antenna spacing, and frequency tuning?",
    "answer": "When setting up antennas for a Pepwave Transit Duo Cat 12 or HD4-MBX Cat 18, using a single 4x4 MIMO dome antenna for two modems is more convenient but can result in reduced performance compared to using two separate 2x2 MIMO antennas. The main trade-off is that a single 4x4 antenna may introduce interference, especially if both modems operate on the same carrier and frequencies, while two 2x2 antennas can better isolate signals and maximize throughput. For optimal performance, antennas should be spaced 1'-2' apart to minimize transmit interference, particularly for upload speeds. Though practical constraints, such as case size, may require closer spacing, this can negatively impact performance. Multiple antennas can share the same ground plane, like a large sheet of metal, without issue. Additionally, the HD4-MBX Cat 18's antenna ports are best tuned to different frequencies for optimal performance, and frequency allocation per modem can be managed manually to further reduce interference. In some setups, mounting antennas at different angles or on different levels within a single dome can help mitigate interference if space is limited.",

If the problem persists after the upgrade, it is advisable to log a ticket with engineering for further assistance.\n\n## Document_3\n\nPepwave products do not use Broadcom or Cypress Wi-Fi chipsets, and therefore, they are not affected by the CVE-2019-15126 security flaw that allows a bad actor to exploit encrypted Wi-Fi connections by changing the key to zero, resulting in unencrypted Wi-Fi.\n\n## Document_4\n\nTo transfer settings from an old Balance 380 to a new one, swapping the card is not possible. However, if InControl was used, the device configuration is automatically backed up to the cloud with every change, allowing for easy download of the settings from there.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe IMEI of a cellular device can be found in the Dashboard of the Pepwave router by clicking on the \"Details\" link for the Cellular connection, which displays the IMEI in a pop-up window.\n\n## Document_6\n\nSpeedFusion technology allows for the combination of multiple WAN connections to enhance internet speed and reliability. It operates on a hierarchy where PepVPN serves as the foundation, followed by SpeedFusion Hot Failover and then SpeedFusion Bonding. Traffic management approaches can be applied on top of bonding, including options such as Bonding, Lowest Latency, Weighted Round Robin, and Overflow. WAN Smoothing can be enabled to duplicate packets for reduced packet loss, consuming additional bandwidth. If WAN Smoothing is set to maximum, the SpeedFusion distribution algorithm is ignored, but at lower levels, duplicate packets are distributed according to the selected traffic distribution rules. In scenarios where the Lowest Latency distribution is used, SpeedFusion continuously selects the WAN with the lowest latency for outbound packets, adjusting as network conditions change.\n\n## Document_7\n\nPeplink SpeedFusion technology allows for the bonding of multiple internet connections to provide a combined bandwidth, enhancing throughput and redundancy. It utilizes built-in VPN technology to achieve this, differentiating it from simple load balancing. To implement SpeedFusion, both ends of the connection must utilize Peplink devices, as SpeedFusion requires compatible hardware to function effectively. The proposed setup involves using a Peplink 710 in the main office with multiple ADSL connections and a Peplink Balance 20 at home or branch offices to achieve increased download speeds through bonded connections.\n\n## Document_8\n\nTo aggregate multiple cellular connections across different locations for increased upload bandwidth and connection availability, Peplink's SpeedFusion technology can be utilized. This technology is a core advantage of Peplink products, allowing for the bonding of multiple connections to enhance performance and reliability.\n\n## Document_9\n\nCurrently, there are no plans to change the minimum health connection check settings in future firmware updates for Peplink devices. The user is experiencing a delay of 5 to 10 seconds for failover to a backup connection when the main connection goes down, which is influenced by the health check set to 5 seconds and a timeout of 2 seconds. For seamless failover between WAN links, it is recommended to explore SpeedFusion technology, which enhances connection reliability and performance.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Pepwave MAX BR1 is recommended to support up to 25 simultaneous users. While this is not a strict software limit, exceeding this number may lead to a poor user experience due to the limitations of a single cellular connection.\n\n## Document_11\n\nOn a Pepwave UBR router, only a single Wi-Fi as WAN connection can be active at any given moment, although multiple Wi-Fi as WAN profiles can be configured for use.\n\n## Document_12\n\nWhen integrating a Pepwave router with a 22G external antenna in a campervan, it is suggested to use the external antenna for Wi-Fi connections to maintain signal quality. The signal strength typically does not drop significantly when transitioning from outside to inside the vehicle, allowing for effective use of the Wi-Fi signal both inside the van and for several hundred feet outside. Alternatively, using a 20G antenna or not connecting the Wi-Fi cables can help keep the Wi-Fi signal confined within the van.\n\n## Document_13\n\nPeplink's SpeedFusion technology enables bandwidth bonding by combining multiple WAN connections, such as fixed and cellular links, to enhance throughput and reliability. This technology allows for the creation of a robust internet connection by bonding different types of networks, including Starlink and cellular, which compensates for dropouts and optimizes data traffic through dynamic weighted bonding. Additionally, SpeedFusion includes WAN smoothing, which sends copies of data packets across multiple WAN links to ensure a jitter-free data stream, and hot failover, which maintains session continuity during link failures. Peplink's solutions can be configured as standalone SD-WAN devices or integrated into existing SD-WAN setups. The InControl2 platform provides management capabilities for Peplink devices, enabling configuration, monitoring, and reporting, while also supporting geographic functionalities and remote management through mobile applications.\n\n## Document_14\n\nPeplink's technology allows for the aggregation of multiple internet connections, providing seamless failover and real-time decision-making at the packet level, which is crucial for maintaining reliable connectivity during high-demand situations such as live calls or events with numerous connected devices. The use of SpeedFusion technology enables dynamic shifting of connections, ensuring that users experience minimal disruptions even when one connection encounters issues. This capability is particularly beneficial in environments where traditional connections may be unreliable, such as rural areas with power line interference. Peplink's solutions are designed to be user-friendly, allowing for quick configuration and management of multiple connections, making advanced connectivity accessible to a broader audience, including individual users and enterprises alike.\n\n## Document_15\n\nPeplink provides solutions for enhancing mobile connectivity in challenging environments, such as remote locations with poor signal. The use of SpeedFusion technology allows for the bonding of multiple connections, including Starlink and cellular links, to ensure reliable internet access. Key features include WAN smoothing, which duplicates traffic to minimize packet loss and latency during critical applications like video conferencing, and dynamic weighted bonding, which optimizes the use of diverse connections with varying speeds. These settings help maintain consistent performance for both real-time streaming and large file uploads, making it easier for users to operate without needing extensive IT support in the field.\n\n## Document_16\n\nPeplink offers solutions for unbreakable internet connectivity through its SpeedFusion Cloud technology, which allows users to connect SpeedFusion-compatible routers and subscribe to a service plan. This technology utilizes failover capabilities to ensure seamless connections, minimizing disruptions during activities such as video conferencing and streaming. One of the key features is the One Smoothing technology, which addresses packet loss by replicating lost packets during transmission, thus preventing jittering in video calls. Additionally, Peplink's bandwidth bonding technology enables the combination of multiple connections into a single VPN tunnel, enhancing bandwidth and redundancy without the need for complex setups. This approach allows for reliable internet access, even in challenging conditions, ensuring that users experience consistent connectivity for various applications.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo import settings from an old Peplink Balance 380 to a new one, it is essential to have a backup of the configuration file, which can be downloaded from the router's admin interface under System > Configuration > Download Active Configurations. If a backup is available, it can be imported into the new device. However, swapping the internal card between devices is not a viable option. Regularly backing up the configuration after changes is recommended for ease of recovery.\n\n## Document_18\n\nSwapping the card from an old Balance 380 to a new Balance 380 is a viable method to transfer settings, and it successfully powered on and functioned correctly. However, it is necessary to upgrade the firmware from version 5.4 to a newer version for optimal performance.\n\n## Document_19\n\nTo transfer settings from an old Peplink Balance 380 to a new one, it is possible to back up the configuration file from the old device and then import it into the new device.\n\n## Document_20\n\nSpeedFusion technology allows the bonding of multiple WAN connections to achieve higher speeds and reliability. Traffic control algorithms can prioritize connections based on latency, while smoothing helps reduce packet loss by utilizing different connections to ensure a stable experience. However, if less stable connections are included in the mix, they may negatively affect overall performance, regardless of the Peplink technology. The persistence feature is useful for specific applications, but it may lead to load balancing rather than true bonding. The combination of these features should be carefully configured to achieve a reliable connection, especially for applications sensitive to packet loss, such as cloud software.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo aggregate multiple cellular connections across different locations for increased upload bandwidth and connection availability, a Peplink Balance 580 can be utilized. By setting up SpeedFusion between the Balance 580 at headquarters and HD4 devices at remote sites, the system can effectively manage the connections. The Balance 580 supports up to 50 tunnels, allowing for extensive connectivity options.\n\n## Document_22\n\nTo aggregate multiple cellular connections for increased upload bandwidth and connection availability, using two Peplink HD4 devices can be effective, as each HD4 can connect to two LTE connections and a WiFi WAN. However, if a VPN is involved, this setup may not be feasible due to potential complications with the VPN configuration.\n\n## Document_23\n\nIn a setup where multiple cellular connections need to be aggregated across different locations to achieve the required upload bandwidth and ensure connection availability, using a Balance 580 connected to multiple MAX HD4 devices can allow for up to 8 active LTE connections. This configuration can facilitate load balancing between different locations, although the reliability of the connections should be considered, as a complete failure of all LTE connections is unlikely in practical scenarios.\n\n## Document_24\n\nTo aggregate multiple cellular connections over long distances for increased upload bandwidth and connection availability, the feasibility of point-to-point (PTP) connections between separate boxes is confirmed. The appropriate sizing of the models used will depend on the type and volume of traffic being handled.\n\n## Document_25\n\nThe failover mechanism to a second WAN link involves three key parameters: Connection Timeout, Health Check Interval, and Health Check Retries. These settings determine how quickly the system can switch to a backup connection when the primary connection fails, impacting the overall response time during connectivity issues.\n\n## Document_26\n\nThe Pepwave UBR router supports only one Wi-Fi WAN connection at a time, as indicated by its datasheet which specifies that it operates on either the 2.4GHz (802.11b/g/n) or 5GHz (802.11a/n) band, but not both simultaneously. In contrast, the Pepwave Transit Pro router can support two simultaneous Wi-Fi WAN connections due to its dual-band capability (2.4GHz / 5GHz) and Wi-Fi 6 technology with 2x2 MIMO.\n\n## Document_27\n\nWhen using a Pepwave router with external antennas, the signal is broadcast from the location of the antennas. To ensure WiFi is strong inside a campervan, it is advisable to use indoor WiFi antennas instead of connecting the outdoor antenna cables. If the router supports multiple access points, one can be placed inside the van and another outside for flexibility in coverage.\n\n## Document_28\n\nPeplink's SpeedFusion technology allows for the bonding of multiple network connections, ensuring that the failure of one connection does not disrupt the overall communication. This technology enhances reliability and provides smooth connectivity from remote sites to the internet. Peplink's InTouch feature enables out-of-band management, allowing users to connect to and troubleshoot third-party devices like printers and switches through the Peplink network. The Peplink devices support dual SIM structures, with single radio devices having one active and one passive SIM, while dual radio devices can support up to four SIM cards, allowing for two active connections at any time. This setup ensures continuous connectivity even if one connection fails, making it particularly useful for critical applications such as broadcasting and emergency services.\n\n",

      "SpeedFusion technology allows the bonding of multiple WAN connections to achieve higher speeds and reliability. Traffic control algorithms can prioritize connections based on latency, while smoothing helps reduce packet loss by utilizing different connections to ensure a stable experience. However, if less stable connections are included in the mix, they may negatively affect overall performance, regardless of the Peplink technology. The persistence feature is useful for specific applications, but it may lead to load balancing rather than true bonding. The combination of these features should be carefully configured to achieve a reliable connection, especially for applications sensitive to packet loss, such as cloud software.",
      "To aggregate multiple cellular connections across different locations for increased upload bandwidth and connection availability, a Peplink Balance 580 can be utilized. By setting up SpeedFusion between the Balance 580 at headquarters and HD4 devices at remote sites, the system can effectively manage the connections. The Balance 580 supports up to 50 tunnels, allowing for extensive connectivity options.",
      "To aggregate multiple cellular connections for increased upload bandwidth and connection availability, using two Peplink HD4 devices can be effective, as each HD4 can connect to two LTE connections and a WiFi WAN. However, if a VPN is involved, this setup may not be feasible due to potential complications with the VPN configuration.",
      "In a setup where multiple cellular connections need to be aggregated across different locations to achieve the required upload bandwidth and ensure connection availability, using a Balance 580 connected to multiple MAX HD4 devices can allow for up to 8 active LTE connections. This configuration can facilitate load balancing between different locations, although the reliability of the connections should be considered, as a complete failure of all LTE connections is unlikely in practical scenarios.",
      "To aggregate multiple cellular connections over long distances for increased upload bandwidth and connection availability, the feasibility of point-to-point (PTP) connections between separate boxes is confirmed. The appropriate sizing of the models used will depend on the type and volume of traffic being handled.",
      "The failover mechanism to a second WAN link involves three key parameters: Connection Timeout, Health Check Interval, and Health Check Retries. These settings determine how quickly the system can switch to a backup connection when the primary connection fails, impacting the overall response time during connectivity issues.",
      "The Pepwave UBR router supports only one Wi-Fi WAN connection at a time, as indicated by its datasheet which specifies that it operates on either the 2.4GHz (802.11b/g/n) or 5GHz (802.11a/n) band, but not both simultaneously. In contrast, the Pepwave Transit Pro router can support two simultaneous Wi-Fi WAN connections due to its dual-band capability (2.4GHz / 5GHz) and Wi-Fi 6 technology with 2x2 MIMO.",
      "When using a Pepwave router with external antennas, the signal is broadcast from the location of the antennas. To ensure WiFi is strong inside a campervan, it is advisable to use indoor WiFi antennas instead of connecting the outdoor antenna cables. If the router supports multiple access points, one can be placed inside the van and another outside for flexibility in coverage.",
      "Peplink's SpeedFusion technology allows for the bonding of multiple network connections, ensuring that the failure of one connection does not disrupt the overall communication. This technology enhances reliability and provides smooth connectivity from remote sites to the internet. Peplink's InTouch feature enables out-of-band management, allowing users to connect to and troubleshoot third-party devices like printers and switches through the Peplink network. The Peplink devices support dual SIM structures, with single radio devices having one active and one passive SIM, while dual radio devices can support up to four SIM cards, allowing for two active connections at any time. This setup ensures continuous connectivity even if one connection fails, making it particularly useful for critical applications such as broadcasting and emergency services."

    "query": "How does Peplink's SpeedFusion technology ensure reliable, high-performance internet by combining multiple types of WAN connections, and what additional features or configuration options are available to optimize connection quality and minimize disruption during failover or varying network conditions?",
    "answer": "Peplink's SpeedFusion technology provides reliable, high-performance internet by bonding multiple WAN connections—including fixed, cellular, and even Starlink links—into a single robust connection. This bonding improves both bandwidth and redundancy, as traffic can be dynamically shifted between connections in response to failures or changing network conditions, minimizing disruptions even during live calls or streaming. SpeedFusion operates on a hierarchy with PepVPN as the foundation, supporting advanced features like Hot Failover (which keeps sessions active during link failures), SpeedFusion Bonding (which aggregates bandwidth), and WAN Smoothing (which duplicates packets across multiple links to reduce packet loss and jitter). Users can further optimize performance using various traffic distribution algorithms such as Bonding, Lowest Latency, Weighted Round Robin, and Overflow, tailoring the connection to prioritize speed, reliability, or cost. The InControl2 cloud platform and mobile apps allow for remote configuration, monitoring, and reporting, while features like One Smoothing and dynamic weighted bonding help maintain consistent performance for real-time and high-bandwidth applications. When connections of varying quality are used, SpeedFusion’s configuration should be adjusted to prevent unstable links from degrading the overall experience. Failover timing can be influenced by settings like Connection Timeout and Health Check intervals, and dual-SIM or dual-radio device setups further ensure continuous connectivity.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_2\n\nThe Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini LTEA operates on 802.11n with 1 spatial stream on the 2.4GHz band. Due to the inherent overhead protocols in the WiFi standard, real-world speeds are typically around 40-45% of the maximum PHY data rates achievable, which may explain the lower average speed reported during the PepVPN Test Configuration compared to the expected bandwidth limit of 200 Mbps down and up.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe internet connection issues with the Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini LTE may be attributed to poor cellular signal quality, as indicated by low SINR (3.6 dB) and RSRQ values. To improve connectivity and speeds, it is recommended to reposition the antennas and ensure that both the cellular and diversity antennas are properly installed.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe speed difference observed between a Pepwave BR1 mini and a mobile phone using the same SIM card may be due to the BR1 mini connecting on a 3G network instead of 4G LTE. Speeds of 2-3 Mbps are typical for 3G connections, while the mobile phone is achieving 8-9 Mbps, likely due to its ability to connect to a 4G LTE network.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe difference in speed between a Pepwave BR1 mini and a mobile phone using the same SIM card can be attributed to the Ec/Io value of -13.0 dB, indicating a high level of noise compared to the signal, which results in a poor quality connection to the tower. To improve the connection, it is suggested to use a directional antenna or a device with less gain, and to identify and eliminate any local sources of RF noise that may be affecting the signal quality.\n\n## Document_6\n\nWhen using a Pepwave MAX BR1 MK2 connected to a home WiFi network, users may experience slower download speeds compared to direct connections to the home WiFi. This can occur if the BR1 is used for both WiFi WAN and LAN connections, leading to reduced performance. To improve speeds, it is recommended to use a separate access point (AP) for LAN connections while allowing the BR1 to handle only the WiFi WAN. Additionally, the BR1 MK2 is older hardware, which may contribute to its lower performance compared to newer devices.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe Pepwave Max BR1 Mini is criticized for being underpowered for typical consumer use, particularly in RV settings. It features a CAT4 cellular modem, which is considered slow compared to newer standards, and operates on a single-band WiFi chipset limited to the 2.4GHz band without MIMO capabilities. This design leads to performance issues when using WiFi-WAN in conjunction with access point functions, as it requires alternating packet flows, which reduces overall performance. For better performance and reliability, alternatives such as the Max BR1 Pro 5G or Max Transit CAT18 are recommended, and using a separate device for WiFi access points is suggested for improved connectivity.\n\n## Document_8\n\nTo address slow WiFi speeds on a Peplink BR1 mini while Ethernet speeds are fast, it is recommended to manually download and update the firmware to version 8.0.2. The customer should also contact the third-party vendor to adjust the sales registration date for a full 12-month InControl2 subscription, which facilitates remote diagnostics. Potential causes for slow WiFi could include loose WiFi antennas, interference from nearby equipment, or the need to change the WiFi channel and region settings. Checking the antenna connection and relocating the device may help improve speeds.\n\n## Document_9\n\nTo address slow WiFi speeds of 3.3Mbps on a Pepwave BR1 Mini, it is suggested to consider changing the wireless channel, adjusting transmit power (both increasing and decreasing), and exploring alternative antennas or their placement. Additionally, the drop in LTE speeds from 17Mbps to 2Mbps should be investigated further to determine if it is related to specific conditions or equipment changes.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo improve the performance of a Pepwave BR1 Max LTE router, it is recommended to upgrade the firmware to version 6.3.4 and then to 7.1.0. The firmware can be found in the Pepwave archive by selecting the MAX BR1 model. Additionally, updating the cellular module firmware is advised, which can be done through the support.cgi page by navigating to the cellular module firmware upgrade section and checking for updates.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Pepwave BR1 Max LTE router, when tested against other devices like the AT&T Nighthawk and Verizon Home MiFi, showed significantly lower speeds despite similar signal strength readings. For AT&T, the Pepwave recorded 55ms latency with 3.5mbps down and 1.2mbps up, while the Nighthawk achieved 27ms with 37mbps down and 24mbps up. For Verizon, the Pepwave had 40ms latency with 4.5mbps down and 3mbps up, compared to the MiFi's 30ms with 44mbps down and 40mbps up. Signal strength metrics for both AT&T and Verizon were comparable, indicating that the performance issue may not be related to signal quality. Another user reported similar issues with their MAX BR1 LTEA, achieving speeds under 10mbps while connected to AT&T on band 12, despite better performance on a mobile device.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo address regular outages on the MAX BR1, it is recommended to upgrade the firmware to version 7.0.2, which may resolve stability issues. The firmware can be obtained from the Peplink support downloads page, where release notes are also available for further details.\n\n## Document_13\n\nTo improve poor performance with the AP One 300M, it is advisable to check the transmit power settings, which are configurable on the Advanced Wireless Tab. Additionally, ensure that both antennas are attached and verify that the selected channel is not saturated by other wireless devices, as this can affect signal quality.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo address poor performance with the AP One, which is exhibiting a maximum throughput of 15Mbps while direct connections yield around 70Mbps, it is suggested to investigate potential interference or noise issues. Changing the wireless channel on the AP One may help improve performance, with common channels being 1, 6, and 11. Utilizing a program like InSSIDer can assist in determining the optimal channel to reduce interference.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe user is experiencing lower speed test results on a Pepwave BR1 Mini connected to Vodafone Egypt despite having a strong signal (-66dbm). It is suggested that RF noise may be affecting performance. Additionally, a firmware upgrade to version 8.0 is recommended to potentially improve the situation.\n\n## Document_16\n\nIn testing the Pepwave BR1 Max LTE router, significant speed issues were observed compared to other devices. The AT&T Nighthawk provided 27ms latency with 37mbps down and 24mbps up, while the Verizon Home MiFi delivered 30ms latency with 44mbps down and 40mbps up. In contrast, the Pepwave showed 55ms latency with only 3.5mbps down and 1.2mbps up on AT&T, and 40ms latency with 4.5mbps down and 3mbps up on Verizon. The campground WiFi was also tested, yielding 90ms latency with 5.23mbps down and 0.39mbps up. Signal strength metrics were similar across devices, with RSSI and RSRP values indicating acceptable signal levels for both AT&T and Verizon bands.\n\n## Document_17\n\nWhen experiencing poor performance with an AP One, it is suggested to check the power settings, as excessive power output can negatively impact performance. Additionally, interference from other 2.4 GHz devices, such as phones or baby monitors, should be considered as potential sources of radio frequency interference (RFI) that could affect throughput.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe AP One is designed to have high output power, which should provide better performance compared to consumer-grade Wi-Fi units. However, if the throughput is limited to a maximum of 15Mbps while direct connections to the router yield around 70Mbps, it may indicate a potential issue with the unit itself.

    "query": "A technician is troubleshooting a Pepwave BR1 Mini or Max LTE router that is consistently providing much slower speeds over WiFi and LTE compared to mobile phones or other routers using the same SIM card and in similar signal conditions. What multi-step diagnostic and remediation approach should the technician follow, considering both hardware, software, and environmental factors?",
    "answer": "The technician should conduct a comprehensive troubleshooting process covering both hardware and software aspects, as well as environmental factors:\n\n1. Confirm that the Pepwave BR1 Mini/Max is operating on the correct network type (preferably 4G LTE, not 3G). If it's connecting on 3G, this can explain significantly slower speeds compared to devices using 4G LTE.\n2. Check the signal quality, particularly SINR, RSRQ, and Ec/Io values. Even if signal strength (e.g., RSSI/RSRP) is good, poor signal quality due to high noise (e.g., low SINR, high Ec/Io) can cause slow speeds. Improving antenna placement, using directional antennas, or reducing local RF interference can help.\n3. Verify that all antennas (cellular, diversity, and WiFi) are properly installed and connected. Reposition antennas and the device as needed.\n4. Update the firmware of the Pepwave BR1 to the latest recommended version (at least 8.0.2 for the Mini, or as advised in support documentation). Also, check and update the cellular module firmware via the support page.\n5. For WiFi performance issues, check for loose WiFi antennas, try changing the WiFi channel (avoid congested channels), and consider interference from nearby devices (phones, baby monitors, etc.). Adjust WiFi transmit power up or down as needed, and set the proper WiFi region.\n6. If using WiFi-WAN and acting as an access point simultaneously, performance may degrade due to hardware limitations (single-band, no MIMO, alternating packet flows). Using a separate device for LAN WiFi is recommended for best performance.\n7. If persistent low throughput is observed even after these steps, consider possible hardware limitations (CAT4 modem, older hardware), and compare with other devices. If the unit still underperforms relative to expectations, consider RMA/replacement.",

This approach simplifies the activation process and avoids complications with customer service when trying to set up a prepaid plan directly with the Pepwave router.",
      "The MAX BR1 Mini LTEA-W-C1 is identified as a HW1 model, and the hardware version information can be found on the bottom left of the label on the box.",
      "Different models from the BR1 mini Series are available, which support various cellular bands. To troubleshoot connectivity issues with deployed units in Mexico, it is important to check the specific bands supported by the modems and compare them with the bands used by the local cellular network. Additionally, reviewing the Dashboard for error messages or connection status can provide insights into the problem.",
      "To resolve the issue of a Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini not obtaining an IP address when using a Verizon SIM card that was previously activated on an iPhone, it is important to ensure that the SIM card is associated with a proper data plan that is compatible with the router. Not all SIM cards that work in smartphones will function correctly in a router, as they may require specific configurations or plans for data usage.",
      "When using a SIM card from an old iPhone activated on Verizon in a Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini, issues may arise if there is a mismatch between the hardware and the data plan. Some phone plans may not be compatible with routers, which can lead to problems such as the device being stuck on 'Obtaining IP Address.'",
      "When using a SIM card from an old iPhone activated on Verizon in a Pepwave MAX BR1 Mini, if the device is stuck on 'Obtaining IP Address', it may indicate an issue with the SIM card compatibility or the data plan settings. It is common for cell carriers' customer support to lack knowledge about setting up accounts for such devices, leading users to attempt using phone SIM cards directly. Proper configuration and compatibility with the carrier's data plan are essential for successful operation.",
      "The Pepwave Max Transit LTEA Cat 18 is compatible with Sprint, but users may face challenges activating it with certain Sprint hotspot plans. Entering the Max Transit's IMEI on Sprint's activation page may result in an error indicating that the device cannot be activated. Users have expressed concerns about the high cost of data plans for quality routers compared to cheaper hotspot devices, which can lead to frustration, especially in rural areas with limited internet options.",
      "When activating a Pepwave MAX-BR1-Mini-LTEA-W-T with a Verizon BYOD SIM, users may encounter issues with the IMEI recognition. The Verizon system may not recognize the device, even when the correct 15-character IMEI is used. A workaround involves activating a Verizon Jetpack first, then transferring the SIM to the Pepwave MAX, although the account page may still not recognize the MAX device.",
      "When encountering issues activating a Peplink MAX-BR1-MINI-LTEA-US-T-PRM on the Verizon network, it is important to ensure that the SIM card is set up on a data-only plan and that the device is certified for use on Verizon's network. Users should verify the device's certification status through Verizon's device showcase.

    "query": "If a technician is trying to activate a Verizon SIM card for use in a Pepwave MAX-BR1-MINI-LTEA-W-T or MAX-BR1-MINI-LTE-US-T and encounters issues with obtaining an IP address or Verizon not recognizing the device's IMEI, what troubleshooting and workaround steps are recommended, and what factors related to device certification, SIM type, and carrier policy should be considered?",
    "answer": "When activating a Verizon SIM card in a Pepwave MAX-BR1-MINI-LTEA-W-T or MAX-BR1-MINI-LTE-US-T, several challenges may arise, such as the device being stuck on 'Obtaining IP Address' or Verizon's system not recognizing the device's IMEI. First, verify that the Pepwave model is certified for use on Verizon, as only certified devices are reliably supported for activation and operation. Use a data-only SIM card and ensure the plan is compatible with routers, since voice-capable or standard phone SIMs often will not work in commercial routers like the Pepwave. If Verizon's system does not accept the device's IMEI or activation fails, a common and effective workaround is to first activate the SIM card in a Verizon-certified Jetpack or other Verizon device (using its IMEI), and then transfer the activated SIM to the Pepwave router. This method bypasses IMEI-related restrictions and facilitates successful activation and connectivity. Additionally, ensure the correct APN is configured for static IPs if needed, and consider resetting the Pepwave to factory defaults before activation. For persistent issues, escalate to Verizon's second-level support or consult the device's supplier or a Peplink partner.",

Create an outbound policy named 'priority' with the wired WAN at the top of the list and SpeedFusion Cloud next, ensuring to tick the option to terminate sessions on link recovery before saving and applying the settings.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe Peplink Balance 380 has a maximum limit of 50 concurrent OpenVPN connections. When this limit is reached, additional users attempting to connect will be blocked from establishing a VPN session.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Peplink Balance 380 supports a maximum of 50 concurrent OpenVPN connections, as stated in the documentation. This limit is not just a recommendation; it is a hard-coded restriction. If a 51st VPN user attempts to connect, they will be blocked from establishing a VPN connection until one of the existing users disconnects, as the device cannot handle more than the specified number of concurrent connections.\n\n## Document_5\n\nWhen configuring a Peplink Balance 580 with two WAN connections for outbound DNS resolution, it is important to note that the secondary DNS server will only be used if the primary DNS server is unresponsive. The DNS traffic analysis may show internal NATted IP addresses, such as 192.168.17.198, instead of the queried external web addresses or IPs. To gain better visibility into DNS queries and responses across the network, setting up a syslog server can be beneficial.\n\n## Document_6\n\nWhen aggregating multiple internet connections using a Peplink Balance 580, the type of speed test conducted can significantly impact the results, as browser-based tests typically utilize a single session and may not effectively leverage all available WAN connections. Satellite connections often have high latency (around 800ms on KA band), which can hinder performance compared to DSL connections that have lower latency (20-50ms). For optimal performance, it is suggested to use the satellite link as a backup only, as it can negatively affect the overall speed and latency of the load-balanced connections.\n\n## Document_7\n\nWhen aggregating multiple internet connections using a Peplink Balance 580, the inclusion of a satellite connection with high latency can negatively impact overall speed. Specifically, the satellite connection should not be aggregated with DSL lines, as the high latency of the satellite connection can slow down the entire SpeedFusion VPN tunnel. It is recommended to combine satellite connections only with other satellite connections, while landlines can be effectively combined with cellular connections for better performance.\n\n## Document_8\n\nTo route all SIP traffic through a T1 line with failover to a cable line on a Peplink Balance 580, outbound rules using IP addresses are recommended. Issues may arise when new devices connect to the network, as they can inadvertently use the T1 line, causing congestion for voice traffic. It is important to define outbound policies carefully and ensure that all devices are accounted for in the rules to maintain optimal performance.\n\n## Document_9\n\nTo establish a backup connection for Offices B and C in the event of an MPLS failure, a Peplink Balance can be installed in both offices with ADSL lines connected for redundancy. A PepVPN can be set up from Offices B and C to HQ over the MPLS connection, but it is also possible to create a PepVPN from Offices B and C to Office A, which would then route traffic to HQ via the existing PepVPN. Additionally, it is feasible to configure the Peplink Balance in Offices B and C to failover to the ADSL lines and utilize a PepVPN when the MPLS connection is down, allowing for continued operation during outages.\n\n## Document_10\n\nWhen configuring a Peplink Balance 580 with two WAN connections, it is important to set the DNS servers correctly for outbound DNS resolution. If a secondary DNS server is used, issues may arise where the DNS queries do not return expected results, potentially due to misconfigurations or external factors such as ISP redirection. In this case, the logs showed an unexpected IP address, indicating a possible issue with hostname resolution or DNS server order. Reversing the DNS server order might help in troubleshooting the issue, and contacting Peplink support for further diagnostics may be necessary.\n\n## Document_11\n\nTo optimize the performance of a Peplink Balance 580 when aggregating multiple internet connections, outbound policy settings such as Weighted Balance can be defined to effectively load balance traffic across the 5 WAN connections. This approach can help manage the differing speeds and characteristics of DSL and satellite connections, potentially allowing for more efficient use of available bandwidth.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe user is running a Peplink Balance 580 to aggregate five internet connections: one satellite connection with 10 Mbps upload/download and four Bell DSL lines that combine for 20 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload. The user has observed that disabling the DSL lines sometimes results in better connection speeds than when they are enabled. The user experiences inconsistent performance, noting that they cannot achieve full speeds through the Peplink device, while direct connection to the satellite provides the expected 10 Mbps speeds.\n\n## Document_13\n\nTo ensure that SIP traffic is routed through a T1 line with failover to cable lines on a Peplink Balance 580, it is recommended to dedicate a VLAN for the Voice network. The outbound policy should source from the voice network and target trusted host networks, using UDP or TCP protocols. The algorithm should be set to priority for the circuits, avoiding load balancing for voice traffic to prevent issues such as one-way audio or registration problems during calls.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo set up a backup connection for Offices B and C in case the MPLS link to Office A goes down, a Peplink Balance can be installed in both offices with ADSL lines connected for backup. By enabling expert mode under outbound policies and defining the remote ends network under destination using the Priority algorithm, the MPLS link can be set as the top connection priority, while the PepVPN over ADSL lines can be set as the secondary option. This configuration ensures that all traffic is routed through MPLS unless it fails, at which point traffic will automatically switch to the PepVPN connection.\n\n",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nThe maximum throughput for the Pepwave Surf SOHO T router is 120 Mbps, which explains why a speed test through the SOHO shows 95 Mbps, as it is operating within its specified limits. The difference in speed between the internet router and the SOHO is not indicative of a malfunction but rather a result of the router's maximum capacity.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 can successfully ping and trace the printer, indicating it is reachable on the network. However, the printer does not consistently appear on the client list and is unresponsive to Wake-on-LAN requests, which may suggest that the printer does not support this function. The client list may not accurately reflect all connected devices, especially if they are only communicating on the local area network without Internet access. Restarting the router temporarily allows the printer to appear on the client list, but it subsequently disappears after a few minutes, indicating potential connectivity issues.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 router is experiencing issues with a wired printer that intermittently appears on the client list but is marked as inactive. The printer can be pinged from a PC and is visible in traceroute results, but it does not respond to Wake-on-LAN requests and disappears from the client list after a few minutes. Wired PCs can print to the printer, but Wi-Fi devices, including a phone, cannot detect it. The printer lacks a web UI, and there are no VLANs configured on the network. The issue persists despite the router being powered by a UPS during a power outage, and it is suggested that pressing the router's reset button might resolve the issue.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Peplink Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput of 120 Mbps, which may limit connection speeds to around 100 Mbps, even if the internet service is upgraded to 200 Mbps. For higher throughput needs, considering a Peplink Balance 20X or other devices that support closer to 200 Mbps is advisable.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe Peplink Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput of around 120 Mbps, which may not be sufficient for high-speed internet plans like 1000 Mbps. Users experiencing buffering issues while streaming may need to consider upgrading to a different router that can handle higher speeds, as the current setup may not be compatible with the desired internet performance.\n\n## Document_6\n\nWhen considering extending wireless coverage with a Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3, it is confirmed that connecting two SOHOs over Ethernet to operate one as an access point (AP) is not feasible, as DHCP cannot be handled by the primary SOHO in that configuration. However, connecting an AP One Mini to the SOHO via Ethernet is possible, allowing both devices to be configured with the same SSIDs and passwords, enabling seamless connectivity for devices transitioning between the two based on signal strength.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput of 120 Mbps, which is significantly lower than the gigabit speeds available from fiber optic connections. Users may experience lower speeds on different connection types, such as 190 Mbps on a gigabit Ethernet USB dongle and 45 Mbps on 5GHz WiFi, indicating that the router's limitations are affecting overall performance.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 may not be able to handle the upgraded internet speed of 400 Mbps, as indicated by the user's experience of only achieving 110 Mbps when connected through the router. Other models, such as the Balance One Core and three additional models, support throughput ranging from 350 to 600 Mbps, which may be more suitable for higher speed internet connections.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 can be configured to use a different subnet, such as a /23, which allows for up to 510 device IPs. This configuration can support a larger number of devices compared to the default DHCP settings. However, managing 250 devices on the SOHO may depend on the required bandwidth and the number of sessions that need to be supported.\n\n## Document_10\n\nWhen using a Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 with an ARRIS SB6141 Cable Modem, users may experience reduced throughput compared to direct modem connections. The Surf SOHO MK3 is confirmed to operate at 1000Base-T mode, but users have reported download speeds between 50-57 Mbps despite having a 160 Mbps service. Testing on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands may yield different performance results, as indicated by a user who experienced 44 Mbps on 2.4 GHz and 62 Mbps on 5 GHz with a similar setup.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe throughput rating of the Pepwave Surf SOHO (MK3) at 120 Mbps is determined by the hardware capabilities of the device, rather than being artificially limited by software. Future models are expected to have higher throughput due to the use of more powerful internal components, which may also result in an increase in selling price.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 has a rated WAN throughput of 120Mbps, which can lead to reduced speeds based on network traffic and router load. For users requiring higher throughput, the Balance One with WiFi is recommended as a more suitable device for high-speed connections.\n\n## Document_13\n\nFor tethering with the Pepwave Surf, users should refer to the full list of currently supported modems available on the Peplink website. If a modem is unsupported, there are steps provided for users to follow, which may lead to engineering creating drivers for that modem.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput of 120 Mbps, which is typically measured under optimal lab conditions. Users may experience lower speeds in real-world scenarios, and if a user has upgraded their internet service to 200 Mbps but is only achieving speeds around 100 Mbps, it may be necessary to consider upgrading to a faster router to fully utilize the increased WAN speed.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput limit of 120 Mbps, which means it cannot achieve higher speeds regardless of the internet plan. For users needing higher speeds, upgrading to a more powerful unit such as the Balance One, which supports up to 600 Mbps, or the Balance 20X, which supports up to 900 Mbps, is recommended. These speeds are under optimal conditions, and actual speeds may vary based on factors like Wi-Fi signal strength and channel congestion.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 and the AP One Mini can be used together to improve wireless coverage. When connecting two SOHOs over Ethernet, it is possible to configure one SOHO to operate solely as an access point (AP), with DHCP managed by the primary SOHO, allowing devices connected to the secondary SOHO to be on the same VLAN and subnet. Additionally, when connecting an AP One Mini to the SOHO via Ethernet, both devices can be configured to use the same SSIDs and passwords for seamless connectivity, although ensuring the SSID appears only once may require specific channel configurations.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe current version of the Pepwave Surf SOHO has a maximum router throughput of 120 Mbps, which explains the lower speed test results observed when connected to a fiber optic connection. Users should not expect to achieve gigabit speeds with this device, as its specifications limit the throughput significantly below that level.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe throughput of a Pepwave Surf SOHO router can be influenced by several factors including the number of configured rules and the use of special features. Peplink tends to be conservative in their bandwidth specifications. WiFi performance can vary significantly due to factors such as frequency band, channel interference, signal strength, channel width, number of streams, and the WiFi generation of both the router and the client device.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 has a specified throughput capability of 120 Mbps. Users may experience lower speeds when connected through the router compared to a direct connection to the modem, which can be attributed to the router's limitations.\n\n## Document_20\n\nWhen using a Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 with an ARRIS SB6141 Cable Modem, users may experience reduced throughput, achieving only 50-57 Mbps compared to direct connections to the modem that yield 160-170 Mbps. The Surf SOHO MK3 is running firmware version 7.1.0 and has been tested with various port speed settings, including 1000Mbps duplex and Auto, but these adjustments did not improve speeds. The router's advertised aggregate throughput is 120 Mbps, which may be a limiting factor in achieving higher speeds through the router.\n\n## Document_21\n\nWhen using a Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 with an ARRIS SB6141 Cable Modem, users may experience reduced download speeds compared to direct connections to the modem. The Surf SOHO MK3 is confirmed to operate at 1000Base-T mode, and settings such as port speed and upload/download bandwidth are set to 1 Gbps. Initial CPU usage during boot may affect speed test results, suggesting that waiting for the router to stabilize before testing could yield better performance.\n\n",

Restarting the router temporarily allows the printer to appear on the client list, but it subsequently disappears after a few minutes, indicating potential connectivity issues.",
      "The Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 router is experiencing issues with a wired printer that intermittently appears on the client list but is marked as inactive. The printer can be pinged from a PC and is visible in traceroute results, but it does not respond to Wake-on-LAN requests and disappears from the client list after a few minutes. Wired PCs can print to the printer, but Wi-Fi devices, including a phone, cannot detect it. The printer lacks a web UI, and there are no VLANs configured on the network. The issue persists despite the router being powered by a UPS during a power outage, and it is suggested that pressing the router's reset button might resolve the issue.",
      "The Peplink Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput of 120 Mbps, which may limit connection speeds to around 100 Mbps, even if the internet service is upgraded to 200 Mbps. For higher throughput needs, considering a Peplink Balance 20X or other devices that support closer to 200 Mbps is advisable.",
      "The Peplink Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput of around 120 Mbps, which may not be sufficient for high-speed internet plans like 1000 Mbps. Users experiencing buffering issues while streaming may need to consider upgrading to a different router that can handle higher speeds, as the current setup may not be compatible with the desired internet performance.",
      "When considering extending wireless coverage with a Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3, it is confirmed that connecting two SOHOs over Ethernet to operate one as an access point (AP) is not feasible, as DHCP cannot be handled by the primary SOHO in that configuration. However, connecting an AP One Mini to the SOHO via Ethernet is possible, allowing both devices to be configured with the same SSIDs and passwords, enabling seamless connectivity for devices transitioning between the two based on signal strength.",
      "The Pepwave Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput of 120 Mbps, which is significantly lower than the gigabit speeds available from fiber optic connections. Users may experience lower speeds on different connection types, such as 190 Mbps on a gigabit Ethernet USB dongle and 45 Mbps on 5GHz WiFi, indicating that the router's limitations are affecting overall performance.",
      "The Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 may not be able to handle the upgraded internet speed of 400 Mbps, as indicated by the user's experience of only achieving 110 Mbps when connected through the router. Other models, such as the Balance One Core and three additional models, support throughput ranging from 350 to 600 Mbps, which may be more suitable for higher speed internet connections.",
      "The Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 can be configured to use a different subnet, such as a /23, which allows for up to 510 device IPs. This configuration can support a larger number of devices compared to the default DHCP settings. However, managing 250 devices on the SOHO may depend on the required bandwidth and the number of sessions that need to be supported.",
      "When using a Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 with an ARRIS SB6141 Cable Modem, users may experience reduced throughput compared to direct modem connections. The Surf SOHO MK3 is confirmed to operate at 1000Base-T mode, but users have reported download speeds between 50-57 Mbps despite having a 160 Mbps service. Testing on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands may yield different performance results, as indicated by a user who experienced 44 Mbps on 2.4 GHz and 62 Mbps on 5 GHz with a similar setup.",
      "The throughput rating of the Pepwave Surf SOHO (MK3) at 120 Mbps is determined by the hardware capabilities of the device, rather than being artificially limited by software. Future models are expected to have higher throughput due to the use of more powerful internal components, which may also result in an increase in selling price.",
      "The Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 has a rated WAN throughput of 120Mbps, which can lead to reduced speeds based on network traffic and router load. For users requiring higher throughput, the Balance One with WiFi is recommended as a more suitable device for high-speed connections.",
      "For tethering with the Pepwave Surf, users should refer to the full list of currently supported modems available on the Peplink website. If a modem is unsupported, there are steps provided for users to follow, which may lead to engineering creating drivers for that modem.",
      "The Pepwave Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput of 120 Mbps, which is typically measured under optimal lab conditions. Users may experience lower speeds in real-world scenarios, and if a user has upgraded their internet service to 200 Mbps but is only achieving speeds around 100 Mbps, it may be necessary to consider upgrading to a faster router to fully utilize the increased WAN speed.",
      "The Pepwave Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput limit of 120 Mbps, which means it cannot achieve higher speeds regardless of the internet plan. For users needing higher speeds, upgrading to a more powerful unit such as the Balance One, which supports up to 600 Mbps, or the Balance 20X, which supports up to 900 Mbps, is recommended. These speeds are under optimal conditions, and actual speeds may vary based on factors like Wi-Fi signal strength and channel congestion.",
      "The Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 and the AP One Mini can be used together to improve wireless coverage. When connecting two SOHOs over Ethernet, it is possible to configure one SOHO to operate solely as an access point (AP), with DHCP managed by the primary SOHO, allowing devices connected to the secondary SOHO to be on the same VLAN and subnet. Additionally, when connecting an AP One Mini to the SOHO via Ethernet, both devices can be configured to use the same SSIDs and passwords for seamless connectivity, although ensuring the SSID appears only once may require specific channel configurations.",
      "The current version of the Pepwave Surf SOHO has a maximum router throughput of 120 Mbps, which explains the lower speed test results observed when connected to a fiber optic connection. Users should not expect to achieve gigabit speeds with this device, as its specifications limit the throughput significantly below that level.",
      "The throughput of a Pepwave Surf SOHO router can be influenced by several factors including the number of configured rules and the use of special features. Peplink tends to be conservative in their bandwidth specifications. WiFi performance can vary significantly due to factors such as frequency band, channel interference, signal strength, channel width, number of streams, and the WiFi generation of both the router and the client device.",
      "The Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 has a specified throughput capability of 120 Mbps. Users may experience lower speeds when connected through the router compared to a direct connection to the modem, which can be attributed to the router's limitations.",
      "When using a Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 with an ARRIS SB6141 Cable Modem, users may experience reduced throughput, achieving only 50-57 Mbps compared to direct connections to the modem that yield 160-170 Mbps. The Surf SOHO MK3 is running firmware version 7.1.0 and has been tested with various port speed settings, including 1000Mbps duplex and Auto, but these adjustments did not improve speeds. The router's advertised aggregate throughput is 120 Mbps, which may be a limiting factor in achieving higher speeds through the router.",
      "When using a Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 with an ARRIS SB6141 Cable Modem, users may experience reduced download speeds compared to direct connections to the modem. The Surf SOHO MK3 is confirmed to operate at 1000Base-T mode, and settings such as port speed and upload/download bandwidth are set to 1 Gbps. Initial CPU usage during boot may affect speed test results, suggesting that waiting for the router to stabilize before testing could yield better performance."

    "query": "A technician is troubleshooting why a user’s 400 Mbps internet connection only yields around 100-120 Mbps when routed through a Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3. What are the technical reasons for this behavior, what factors can further impact observed throughput, and what solutions are recommended if the user wants to achieve higher speeds?",
    "answer": "The Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 has a maximum WAN/router throughput of 120 Mbps, which is a hardware limitation and not due to software or configuration. This cap explains why, even with a 400 Mbps or higher internet plan, throughput through the router will not exceed 120 Mbps, and real-world results may be even lower due to network conditions. Other factors influencing observed speeds include Wi-Fi band/channel, signal strength, interference, number of Wi-Fi streams, router load, number of configured rules, and the use of special features. Direct modem connections will show higher speeds because they bypass the SOHO’s throughput cap. If a user requires higher speeds to match a faster internet plan, the only solution is to upgrade to a more powerful router, such as the Peplink Balance One or Balance 20X, which support higher throughput under optimal conditions.",

The current model supports a throughput of 150 Mbps when on the latest firmware.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a throughput speed that can vary between 100 Mbps and 150 Mbps, which may depend on factors such as firmware or hardware configurations. To verify the actual throughput speed, it is recommended to test the connection directly to the WAN using a PC, rather than through a gigabit rated switch.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe throughput speed of the Peplink Balance 20 can be either 100 Mbps or 150 Mbps, which may depend on the specific hardware version or firmware. The R6 model is expected to achieve the higher throughput of 150 Mbps.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 is suitable for small business use with up to 25 users, but the recommended user count is a guideline rather than a strict limit. Important factors to monitor include the throughput rating, which should be compared to the actual traffic load, and potential performance issues such as slow speeds or high CPU load if the device is stressed. The Balance 20 supports two WAN connections and has a throughput of 100Mbps, which is adequate given the current upstream speeds of 10Mbps and 25Mbps. Features like SpeedFusion and VPN are not required for this setup, and the user is not segmenting traffic or using advanced QoS settings.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe throughput on the Peplink Balance 20 is limited to 150 Mbps, which may restrict the performance when connected to higher-speed WANs like a 200 Mbps cable modem or a 400 Mbps T-Mobile 5G gateway. The Balance 20 allows for traffic management by enabling users to send traffic from a specific device, identified by MAC address, to a designated WAN through its Outbound Policy feature, which is a powerful tool for managing network traffic.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a throughput of 150Mbps, which is less than the combined total of the user's WAN connections (100/5M, 150/6M, and 35/5M). For users with 20-30 connections, particularly for applications like Zoom, upgrading to a Peplink Balance 305 is recommended due to its higher capacity and performance, supporting up to 1Gbps throughput. Alternatively, the Balance 210 with an additional license can provide a maximum throughput of 350Mbps, but it is not as capable as the Balance 305.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 is designed for small office or branch environments and is recommended for up to 60 users. In larger network environments, using a Balance router with a higher capacity is advisable to prevent interruptions. The Balance 20 may struggle with handling traffic loads effectively, especially when multiple clients are connected and NATed by another router.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a maximum throughput limit of 150Mbps, which is tied to its hardware. To achieve gigabit speeds, users must upgrade to a Balance 305 or a higher model. Future hardware revisions may allow for increased throughput in new models, but currently, there are no upgrade options for the Balance 20 to support higher speeds.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 may not be adequate for a dermatology clinic experiencing connectivity issues due to increased traffic from multiple devices, including 12 iPads and various networked equipment. The current setup includes two WAN connections, a Comcast connection at 75Mb and a Century Link DSL at 7.5Mb, with plans to upgrade to potentially 500Mb to 1Gb on Century Link and 100Mb on Comcast. Given these anticipated throughput requirements, it is recommended to consider upgrading to a Peplink Balance 305 or Balance 380, especially if SpeedFusion bonding is needed.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a bandwidth limit of 100 Mbps, which may be a concern if WAN speeds increase significantly in the future. The device supports PePVPN in the new 6.1 firmware, providing session persistence but lacking WAN aggregation features found in SpeedFusion. The Balance 20 does not offer user or group bandwidth limitations, which may be a drawback for users needing to allocate minimum bandwidth to specific devices. Additionally, the Balance 20 can handle two WAN connections, one with two static IP addresses and another with a dynamic IP, ensuring proper routing to separate LAN devices.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a router throughput rating of 100 Mbps, which is a limiting factor for the maximum speed experienced when connected through the device. The Balance 20 features 4 Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) LAN ports, but the overall throughput is determined by the router's specifications. Users should consider the total throughput by adding the upload and download speeds of all WAN connections to understand performance limitations.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a router throughput rating of 100 Mbps, which is sufficient for the combined bandwidth of the user's Comcast and Century Link DSL connections, totaling slightly over 50 Mbps. The device can support 1-25 LAN clients, making it suitable for the anticipated growth to 21 clients (9 VoIP lines and 12 computers). The primary bottleneck in this setup is likely the Century Link DSL connection, especially considering the daily internet traffic of 2-3 GB, which is manageable given the available bandwidth. The Balance 20 should continue to perform well under the current and projected usage, with the option to upgrade later if necessary.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 is capable of handling internet speeds up to 100Mbps, making it suitable for home or small office use. It is recommended as a newer model to replace the older Balance Plus unit, which may not support faster internet speeds.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 is undersized for applications involving 20-30 users, particularly with high-demand activities like Zoom calls. For improved performance, it is recommended to consider upgrading to a Peplink Balance One, Balance 210 (with the 3rd WAN port activated), or Balance 305. Engaging a Peplink Partner for tailored recommendations based on specific needs is also advised.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a maximum supported client limit, which may be reached when there are 61 LAN clients connected. If this limit is exceeded, it can lead to unresponsiveness and loss of internet service, causing DHCP clients to auto-negotiate. In such cases, upgrading the hardware may be necessary to accommodate more clients and improve stability.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe Balance 20 router has a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, which is insufficient for users with ISPs offering speeds of 600Mbps and plans for 1000Mbps in the near future. Users are inquiring about potential upgrades for the Balance 20 to support higher throughput speeds or the necessity of upgrading to the Balance 305 to accommodate increasing ISP speeds. There is concern regarding the cost-effectiveness of purchasing a new router that may soon become obsolete as ISPs continue to enhance their offerings.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a bandwidth limit of 100 Mbps, which may be a concern if WAN speeds increase significantly beyond current levels. It does not offer user or group bandwidth limitations, which means it cannot allocate minimum bandwidth for specific users or servers. The device can handle two WAN connections, one with two static IP addresses and another as a DHCP device, allowing for proper routing to separate LAN devices. However, the new firmware version 6.1 for Peplink 20 and 30 provides PepVPN but does not support SpeedFusion for bonding connections.\n\n## Document_18\n\nTo achieve higher download speeds with a Peplink Balance router, it is recommended to use a Balance 305 or a model rated for higher throughput, as the Balance 20 is rated for a maximum of 200Mbps. This may explain the slower speeds experienced when routing through the Peplink device compared to a direct connection to the ISP's router.\n\n",

If this limit is exceeded, it can lead to unresponsiveness and loss of internet service, causing DHCP clients to auto-negotiate. In such cases, upgrading the hardware may be necessary to accommodate more clients and improve stability.",
      "The Balance 20 router has a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, which is insufficient for users with ISPs offering speeds of 600Mbps and plans for 1000Mbps in the near future. Users are inquiring about potential upgrades for the Balance 20 to support higher throughput speeds or the necessity of upgrading to the Balance 305 to accommodate increasing ISP speeds. There is concern regarding the cost-effectiveness of purchasing a new router that may soon become obsolete as ISPs continue to enhance their offerings.",
      "The Peplink Balance 20 has a bandwidth limit of 100 Mbps, which may be a concern if WAN speeds increase significantly beyond current levels. It does not offer user or group bandwidth limitations, which means it cannot allocate minimum bandwidth for specific users or servers. The device can handle two WAN connections, one with two static IP addresses and another as a DHCP device, allowing for proper routing to separate LAN devices. However, the new firmware version 6.1 for Peplink 20 and 30 provides PepVPN but does not support SpeedFusion for bonding connections.",
      "To achieve higher download speeds with a Peplink Balance router, it is recommended to use a Balance 305 or a model rated for higher throughput, as the Balance 20 is rated for a maximum of 200Mbps. This may explain the slower speeds experienced when routing through the Peplink device compared to a direct connection to the ISP's router."
    ],
    "query": "How does the throughput limitation of the Peplink Balance 20 vary depending on hardware revisions and firmware versions, what is the recommended method to verify actual throughput, and when should a user consider upgrading to a higher model?",
    "answer": "The throughput limitation of the Peplink Balance 20 depends on both the hardware revision and firmware version. The most recent hardware models running the latest firmware can achieve up to 150 Mbps throughput, while older models or those on earlier firmware may be limited to 100 Mbps. Some sources reference a 200 Mbps rating, but the majority of documents confirm 100–150 Mbps as typical. To accurately verify the device's real-world throughput, users should test the connection directly from a PC to the WAN port, avoiding measurements through intermediary switches that could skew results. Users should consider upgrading to a higher model, such as the Balance 305, when their WAN speeds, combined traffic demands, or client counts exceed the Balance 20's throughput capacity, especially if they require speeds above 150 Mbps, anticipate growth, or need advanced features like SpeedFusion bonding. Upgrading is also advised if the network regularly supports more than 25–60 users or is experiencing performance bottlenecks due to exceeding the Balance 20’s throughput or client capacity.",

The standard MAX-BR1 is expected to receive the same certification around June 9th.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe MAX-BR1-LTE-US-T is a CAT3 device that utilizes the MC7354 module, with theoretical download speeds of 100 Mbps and upload speeds of 50 Mbps.\n\n## Document_4\n\nTo connect two different subnets (192.168.30.0/24 and 192.168.63.0/24) to a Peplink Balance 380, it is necessary to create a VLAN or static route for the secondary network. Establishing a VPN tunnel is recommended, with PepVPN preferred over IPsec, and enabling expert mode to define PepVPN routes. An inbound firewall rule should be created with a default deny policy, allowing access only to the 192.168.63.0 network. The MAX-BR1-T router is suitable for the project, but upgrading to the LTE model is suggested for an additional cost.\n\n## Document_5\n\nWhen using the Pepwave MAX HD4 for live video streaming with multiple SIM cards, it is possible to see increased data throughput in speed tests; however, this does not necessarily translate to improved video quality. To enhance network performance, VLANs can be configured on the MAX Transit to segregate traffic. By default, the MAX Transit operates on a flat network (192.168.55.x) without VLAN tagging. To implement VLANs, a managed Layer-3 switch must be connected to the MAX Transit, allowing for the creation of virtual networks that can help manage traffic more effectively. The LAN port on the MAX Transit can be set to 'trunk' to transmit multiple VLANs or 'access' to transmit a single VLAN, depending on the desired configuration.\n\n## Document_6\n\nFor a mobile solution using the MAX HD4 LTE, it is possible to use a single Mobile 42G antenna to minimize installation complexity, as it supports 4 LTE connections, 4 WiFi connections, and GPS. However, if using the LTEA versions of the HD4, it is recommended to attach diversity antennas to take advantage of MIMO technology, which enhances bandwidth per modem.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe Pepwave MAX-BR1-LTE-US-T model has a sensitivity of -91 dBm or better across all bands and supports channel widths of 5, 10, 15, and 20 MHz. It is classified as a CAT3 device and does not support carrier aggregation (CA).\n\n## Document_8\n\nFor implementing a VPN network with three MAX-BR1-T units and a Balance 380, it is confirmed that these devices can be effectively used in vehicles for similar deployments. The MAX-BR1-LTE-A-T or MAX-BR1-T models are suitable for accessing HSPA+ networks on the 850MHz frequency, depending on carrier needs and location. The BR1 units support two SpeedFusion VPN peers, and for mobile solutions, the HD2 and HD4 models are also recommended. Consideration of passenger load on the buses is advised for planning Wi-Fi capacity.\n\n## Document_9\n\nCurrently, Peplink offers LTE-A models, but most of them do not support LTE-A Category 6, as their maximum throughput remains at 200 Mbps, which is not compliant with CAT. 6 specifications. There is no indication of when or if CAT. 6 models will be introduced in the future.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo achieve a network setup with multiple SSIDs and VLANs using a Pepwave MAX HD2 and various access points, it is recommended to create three VLANs and three SSIDs, with two of the SSIDs utilizing captive portals. The captive portals should be assigned to the appropriate VLANs, and it is essential to configure the VLANs on the switches connected to the access points. For easier management of the switches, Peplink's SD-Switch can be utilized.\n\n## Document_11\n\nTo resolve issues with PepVPN on a Peplink MAX-BR1-LTE-E, it is not necessary for the device to be under warranty. If PepVPN is configured through InControl 2 (IC2) and the subscription has expired, the device may become unmanageable, leading to connectivity issues. Users can either purchase an IC2 subscription to manage the device remotely or configure PepVPN directly through the device's web admin interface.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe MAX BR1 router has a maximum throughput capability of 100Mbps. The MAX-BR1-LTE-E-T model does not support CAT.3 LTE speed; instead, CAT.3 LTE is supported by the MAX-BR1-LTE-T model.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Pepwave MAX-BR1 does not currently have Class 1 Division 2 (C1D2) certification, which limits its use in certain oil and gas industry applications. The inquiry suggests that the BR1 Classic and BR1 Mini models may also lack this certification, impacting sales opportunities in environments that require C1D2 compliance.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe Peplink MAX-BR1 currently does not have Class 1 Division 2 (C1D2) certification, which limits its sales potential in oil and gas sectors that require this certification. There is an ongoing effort to request the necessary certification for the MAX-BR1, and updates regarding certified products will be provided on the forum.\n\n## Document_15\n\nTo connect two different subnets (192.168.30.0/24 and 192.168.63.0/24) to a Peplink Balance 380, a static route should be created in the Balance 380 for the 192.168.63.0 network. This involves setting the subnet mask to 255.255.255.0 and the default gateway to the appropriate address (e.g., 192.168.30.2). This configuration allows the Balance 380 to see and control the 192.168.63.0 network through firewall rules and outbound policies, facilitating communication between the subnets without requiring a VPN if the connection is merely a wireless bridge.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo connect two different subnets (192.168.30.0/24 and 192.168.63.0/24) to a Peplink Balance 380, an IPsec tunnel can be created for the 192.168.63.0/24 network using an Outbound policy. The IPsec tunnel should be isolated to only allow access to the 192.168.63.0/24 network while enabling bidirectional access between the two subnets. For the proposed network equipment, the MAX-BR1-T is considered a cost-effective option that supports native DC power (12V, 24V, 48V). The WAN IP for the BR1 should be set to 192.168.30.2 if it is used in the network diagram.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo connect two different subnets (192.168.30.0/24 and 192.168.63.0/24) to a Peplink Balance 380, an IPsec tunnel can be created for the 192.168.63.0/24 network using an Outbound policy. It is important to isolate the IPsec tunnel from the main network, allowing only access to the 192.168.63.0/24 network. The subnets should be able to access each other, but the IPsec tunnel traffic must be restricted to the 63 network. For building B, a MAX-BR1-T router is a cost-effective option that can take native DC power, although a static route may suffice without needing an additional router.\n\n## Document_18\n\nTo connect two different subnets (192.168.30.0/24 and 192.168.63.0/24) to a Peplink Balance 380, a layer 3 device such as a switch is required to manage the routing between them. The layer 3 device should obtain a 192.168.30.x address from the Balance, which will serve as the default gateway, and perform NAT to the 192.168.63.x address. Alternatively, if VLANs are used, a VLAN-capable switch can facilitate the connection. The configuration must ensure that the IPsec tunnel only allows access to the 192.168.63.0/24 network while permitting mutual access between the two subnets.\n\n## Document_19\n\nWhen testing the Pepwave MAX HD4 for live video streaming with multiple SIM cards, it is noted that while bonding four SIM cards increases data throughput as seen in speed tests, it does not necessarily improve video quality compared to using a single SIM. For enhancing resiliency in livestreaming, settings on the Pepwave device should be optimized for bandwidth prioritization, especially when streaming to platforms like Facebook Live, Vimeo, and YouTube. Utilizing features like FEC (Forward Error Correction) can help, but may introduce packet loss if not configured properly. It is important to consider the balance between bandwidth and latency, particularly when streaming at rates between 4 and 10 Mbps.\n\n## Document_20\n\nWhen testing the Pepwave MAX HD4 for live video streaming with four SIM cards bonded, an increase in data throughput is observed, but video quality does not improve compared to using a single SIM card. Issues with video encoding and packet delivery to the Vimeo server have been noted, with the SpeedFusion service registering significantly lower bandwidth than expected. Settings such as Dynamix Weighted Bonding, Forward Error Correction, and WAN Smoothing have been attempted to optimize performance, but problems persist with the ATEM encoder's cache filling up and inadequate data delivery rates.\n\n## Document_21\n\nWhen using the Pepwave MAX HD4 for live video streaming with multiple SIM cards, users may experience increased data throughput in speed tests, but video quality may not improve compared to using a single SIM. Issues with video streaming devices like ATEM products and Vidiu Pro can arise when using bonding or FEC tunnels; instead, using a single WAN or WAN SMOOTHING tunnel may resolve these problems. Additionally, adjusting bandwidth limits on the PepVPN tunnel settings can improve throughput beyond hardware limits, as demonstrated by increasing speeds from a capped 75 Mbps to a maximum of 130 Mbps by applying a 150 Mbps limit.\n\n",

    "query": "How does the choice of Qualcomm modem (X55 vs X62) affect the capabilities and future-proofing of Peplink BR1 Pro 5G and BR2 Pro 5G routers, particularly regarding AT&T's 5G network, speed, and supported features?",
    "answer": "The Qualcomm modem in a Peplink router significantly affects its speed, support for new 5G bands, and compatibility with future carrier network upgrades. The BR1 Pro 5G originally used the X55 modem, which supports 5G and Wi-Fi 6, offers up to 400 Mbps in real-world use, and provides up to 4x4 MIMO for 5G. However, the X55 does not support AT&T's upcoming Andromeda mid-band 5G spectrum, limiting its future use with that carrier. The newer X62 modem, now used in updated versions of the BR2 Pro 5G (and in the BR1 Pro 5G in some regions), offers multi-band 5G carrier aggregation, support for new international and US bands like AT&T's Andromeda, and is compatible with 5G Phase 2, ensuring better future-proofing. The X62 also delivers higher theoretical speeds, improved performance in fringe areas, and supports advanced features such as eSIM and dual modem configurations. Thus, choosing a model with the X62 modem ensures greater compatibility with future AT&T networks, higher performance, and longer device relevance compared to the X55-based models.",

The missing algorithm is likely 'fastest response time', which was added most recently. However, it is also possible that the MediaFast reference and datasheets are outdated.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe MediaFast 500 supports all 8 load balancing algorithms, contrary to the initial impression that it only supports 7. This indicates that the specifications for the MediaFast family may not be fully representative of its capabilities regarding load balancing algorithms.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 and 30 routers are rated for 100 Mbps of throughput, which includes both upload and download speeds. They support various types of WAN connections, including Ethernet and USB, although some USB connections may require a firmware update. The Balance series is designed to handle multiple WAN connections, ensuring seamless failover in case one connection drops.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Peplink Balance 300 has a listed capacity of 20 domains, with additional limitations on DNS records per domain, including 5 NS records, 5 MX records, 30 CNAME records, and 30 IP addresses for A records. Users have reported issues with the device not retaining more than 71 domain names after a power cycle, indicating that the device may not handle more than its specified capacity. The device is also noted to have not received firmware updates since 2009, leading to unresolved bugs, including the lack of SMTP authentication for SMTP forwarding, which is critical for modern ISPs.\n\n## Document_5\n\nIn a network configuration involving PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is noted that IP Sec tunnels do not typically advertise their routes through second hops. To enable connectivity from satellite sites to Azure, a static route for the Azure subnet can be added on the satellite devices, pointing to the Balance 508. Additionally, firewall configurations on both the satellite sites and Azure may need to be reviewed to ensure they allow the necessary traffic exchange.\n\n## Document_6\n\nIn a network configuration involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 routers connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is important to ensure that outbound rules are correctly set up for traffic to traverse from the satellite sites to Azure. The Balance 508 needs to properly advertise its routes to the connected 305 devices for successful end-to-end connectivity.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe outbound policy configuration on the PepLink Balance 508 was successfully adjusted, allowing the connected Balance 305 devices to traverse to Azure through the established IP Sec VPN tunnels. This indicates that proper routing and policy settings are essential for enabling connectivity between satellite sites and Azure.\n\n## Document_8\n\nOn the Peplink Balance two, the LAN/WAN light may not illuminate if there is no connectivity or if the link is operating at 10 or 100 Mbps. This behavior is documented in the May 2020 manual for Balance models.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe Peplink Balance 300, which is approximately 15 years old, supports a maximum throughput of 20Mbps. Therefore, if clients are experiencing a maximum speed of 15Mbps, this is within the expected performance limits of the device, despite having three WAN connections with a total potential speed of 300Mbps.\n\n## Document_10\n\nIt is not possible to convert the configuration from a PepLink Balance 310 to a PepLink Balance 210. Additionally, it is important to confirm whether a 3rd WAN activation license has been purchased for the Balance 210 router.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe default login credentials for the Peplink Balance 1 router are username 'admin' and password 'admin'.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe WiFi light on a Peplink One Balance indicates the status of traffic flow over the WiFi connection. A blinking green light signifies that there is traffic, while a slowly blinking green or static green light indicates no traffic but that WiFi is enabled. If the WiFi light is off, it means that WiFi is turned off.\n\n## Document_13\n\nTo block ping replies on a Peplink Balance 300, you can disable the ping reply feature for the WAN interface. It is important to confirm the device model, as the Balance 300 is an older model that has been retired.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe latest firmware for the Peplink Balance 20W is v4.8.1, and this model has been obsoleted. Users are advised to consider refreshing their router for updated features and support.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Peplink Balance e30 is not a DSL modem and does not have RJ11 ports; it only features RJ45 Ethernet ports. To connect the Balance router to an ADSL connection, a separate DSL modem is required that provides an Ethernet output to connect to the Balance's WAN port.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe Balance 20 and 30 routers have the same technical specifications, with the primary difference being that the Balance 30 includes an additional WAN port. The Balance 210 offers advantages such as support for a greater number of users, a more extensive list of Outbound Load Balancing options (7 options compared to 5 on the 20/30), and increased VPN capabilities not available on the 20 or 30 models. All models support multi-WAN configurations and can accommodate various internet connections including cable, DSL, and 3G/4G.\n\n## Document_17\n\nBoth the Peplink Balance 20 and Balance 30 can be configured for 2 Ethernet connections, while the Balance 30 supports 3 Ethernet connections. Additionally, both models allow for 1 USB 3G/4G connection, which can be set up for backup use through Outbound Policy or WAN status. Users can also implement a bandwidth cap on the USB/Mobile connection to disable it upon reaching a monthly data allowance.\n\n## Document_18\n\nTo enable connectivity from PepLink Balance 305 devices to Azure through a Balance 508, static routes can be configured on the Balance 305 for the Azure subnet, using the Balance 508 as the gateway. Additionally, the Azure configuration should include a static route for the Balance 305 subnet, also using the Balance 508 as the gateway. It is important to ensure that firewall rules on both ends permit this routing to function correctly.\n\n## Document_19\n\nIn a network setup involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via a star topology, issues may arise with route advertisement to Azure through IP Sec VPN tunnels. The Balance 508 may not be advertising its routes to the connected Balance 305 devices, which can prevent satellite sites from accessing Azure. Additionally, static routes may need to connect to gateways within the same subnet, which can complicate configurations if sites are not willing to share a common subnet.\n\n## Document_20\n\nIn a test installation of the Balance two, if the WAN lines show as connected but the LAN lines do not display as connected despite having connectivity, this may be due to a known issue that has been resolved in firmware version 8.1.0.\n\n## Document_21\n\nIn a test installation of the Balance Two router, the WAN ports show as connected with green indicators, while the LAN ports do not display green despite having connectivity. All LAN port speeds are set to Auto, similar to the WAN ports, which may suggest a configuration issue or a need for further investigation into the LAN settings.\n\n## Document_22\n\nThe Balance 300 router supports a maximum throughput of 20mbps per user, despite having three WAN connections each capable of 100mbps. This means that while the total potential speed from the WAN connections is 300mbps, the router's limitations restrict the actual usable speed to 20mbps per user, indicating that the additional bandwidth from the WAN connections is not utilized effectively.\n\n## Document_23\n\nTo set up a Peplink Balance device, connect the modem to WAN1, which is configured by default to receive a DHCP address. Then, connect a PC to the LAN side and access the device's interface by browsing to 192.168.50.1 to begin configuration and usage.\n\n## Document_24\n\nTo connect a Peplink Balance e30 to an ADSL connection, the DSL router should be configured in Bridge mode to allow the Peplink to handle the PPPoE authentication.

However, link drop issues occur when connecting PSW-48 to PSW-24 and between PSW-24 to PSW-24. The engineering team is currently working on debugging and recalibrating the PSW-24 to improve compatibility with the SFP-10G-T, as different transceivers may require different calibration settings for optimal performance.\n\n## Document_2\n\nTo create a VPN connection between two Peplink units, such as the BPL 305 and BPL 310, it is important to refer to the user manual for detailed instructions. Additionally, if there is a router or firewall in front of the Peplink devices, port forwarding must be configured for the default protocols TCP 32015 and UDP 4500 to ensure proper connectivity.\n\n## Document_3\n\nTo create a VPN connection between two Peplink units, specifically the BPL 305 and BPL 310, users can refer to the Balance and MediaFast User Manual for Firmware 7, which is available for download on the Peplink website under the Support section.\n\n## Document_4\n\nTo throttle the upload bandwidth consumed by Dropbox on a PepLink 20, one approach is to create an outbound policy rule that targets Dropbox's IP address range. This involves setting the source to the local network (192.168.1.0/24), the destination to the identified Dropbox IP block (199.47.216.0/22), and using the Priority algorithm to manage bandwidth allocation. Additionally, creating rules based on destination domain could also be considered for more flexibility in managing traffic.\n\n## Document_5\n\nTo integrate Peplink BAL-1350 and Peplink Balance 380 with Solarwinds SIEM, first enable SNMP on the BAL-1350. Then, install the custom MIBs from the Peplink support downloads page into Solarwinds. Finally, configure Solarwinds to point at the BAL-1350 for monitoring.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Peplink 310X does not support Jumbo Frames, as this feature is only available in the Balance 305 and higher models. However, users should check the latest firmware updates, specifically firmware version 8.1.1 Beta 2, for any potential changes or improvements regarding this feature.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe issue with the Ethernet Port status display showing incorrect information on the Balance 310XX Series has been fixed in the 8.1.0 beta 1 build. Users are advised to upgrade to 8.1.0 beta 4 to resolve this issue.\n\n## Document_8\n\nFor a High Availability (HA) setup with Peplink routers, it is necessary to use the same model for the failover configuration. This means that a BPL-380 or BPL-580 should not be paired with a smaller model like the BPL-210 for failover purposes.\n\n## Document_9\n\nTo resolve a persistent red status LED on a Peplink BLP310, it is recommended to perform a factory reset by holding the pin reset button for approximately 10-15 seconds while the device is powered on. If the issue persists after the reset, it is advisable to open a support ticket for further assistance from the technical team.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe MediaFast 750 can be deployed as a content caching solution and has similar routing features to the B710. The caching feature can be turned on or off based on requirements, and it can operate in a layer 2 (bridge) mode, which is suitable for a 'drop in mode' deployment.\n\n## Document_11\n\nWhen using a Peplink B580 for load balancing in a WISP setup, issues with IPTV may arise, particularly with the RTP protocol. The user reports that IPTV worked well with a previous TP-Link balancer under the same configuration, suggesting that the Peplink device may be interfering with RTP traffic, which is essential for IPTV functionality. The setup involves routing internet through the Peplink B580 to the IPTV service, but it fails to function correctly.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo issue public IPs to clients using a Peplink router, it is important to configure the router to allow the billing gateway to handle 1:1 NAT. If the internet fails on WAN1, the public IPs on the LAN will NAT to the public IPs on WAN2. However, IP forwarding cannot be used on more than one WAN with public IPs. Load balancing and failover can be managed through outbound policy rules in the Peplink Balance router.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe FS SFP 10G-T adapter has been tested and confirmed to work with 24/48 port SD switches at 10G mode, indicating its compatibility for use in such setups.\n\n## Document_14\n\nFor connecting a QNAP card to a SD Switch 48-Port using SFP+ to 10Gbase-T adapters, tested modules can be found at the provided links. These modules are likely compatible and have been verified for use in similar setups.\n\n## Document_15\n\nWhen connecting SFP+ ports on a 48-port switch to various devices, issues were observed when connecting SFP+ to SFP+ and 1G to SFP+ ports. However, connections using shielded CAT6 cables to QNAP 10Gbase-T cards from specific SFP+ ports on the switch did not present any problems. The dashboard indicates a 10G connection even when connected to a 1G port, suggesting potential discrepancies in reporting or compatibility.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo manage upload bandwidth for Dropbox on a PepLink 20, one can create an outbound policy rule that restricts Dropbox traffic to a single WAN connection. This involves setting the source to the local network (192.168.1.0/24) and the destination to the Dropbox IP block (199.47.216.0/22), using any protocol and applying a priority algorithm. However, implementing QoS may be challenging due to Dropbox using standard ports (80 and 443) for outbound connections.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo throttle the upload bandwidth consumed by Dropbox on a PepLink 20, one can create an outbound policy rule that specifies the source IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) and the destination IP block for Dropbox (e.g., 199.47.216.0/22). The protocol can be set to ANY, and the algorithm can be either Priority or Enforced. The Priority algorithm allows other upload requests to take precedence, while the Enforced algorithm is stricter, potentially cutting off connectivity if the designated WAN goes down.\n\n## Document_18\n\nJumbo frame support is available only in the Peplink Balance 305 and higher models. The feature was introduced in higher-end models some time ago, but specific details about which models support it are not provided in the release notes.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe Peplink Balance 310X does not support Jumbo Frames, as support for this feature is only available in the Balance 305 and higher models. Additionally, the MediaFast 750 does support Jumbo Frames.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe MediaFast 750 can be deployed in 'Drop-In Mode' for content caching purposes within a network that includes a Balance router. This setup allows the MediaFast 750 to function strictly as a layer 2 content caching solution while the Balance router handles WAN load balancing, failover, and bonding.\n\n## Document_21\n\nThe MediaFast 750 is identical to the Balance 710 in terms of connections, specifications, and supported features, with the added capability of a content caching engine. It can be deployed in a network as a direct replacement for the Balance 710, providing content caching functionality without the need for an additional device.\n\n",

    "query": "Which Peplink and MediaFast models support Jumbo Frames, and what are the key considerations regarding their deployment in mixed environments with models that do not support Jumbo Frames?",
    "answer": "Jumbo Frames are supported on Peplink Balance 305 and higher models, as well as on the MediaFast 750. The Balance 310X does not support Jumbo Frames. The MediaFast 750 is functionally identical to the Balance 710, except it adds content caching, and it can be deployed in a network in place of the Balance 710. When deploying Jumbo Frame-capable devices in an environment that includes models without Jumbo Frame support, it is important to recognize that not all devices will benefit from or handle jumbo frames, which may impact network performance or require special configuration. For example, the Balance 310X, despite being a higher-end model, does not support Jumbo Frames, so mixing it with a Balance 305 or MediaFast 750 would require adjusting expectations or disabling jumbo frames on the network segment.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nWhen using SpeedFusion Cloud with a Pepwave MBX and multiple tunnels, the Default tunnel routes traffic through cellular connections with ISP-provided IP addresses, which may not be subject to Netflix's proxy filter black-list. In contrast, traffic routed through the FEC tunnel may be blocked by Netflix due to the different break-out IP addresses provided by the SpeedFusion Cloud service. This distinction can affect the ability to stream content on platforms like Netflix when using specific tunnels.\n\n## Document_2\n\nWhen attempting to import a firewall rule set from a configuration file on a PepWave MAX BR1 Mini, an error message indicating failure to extract firewall rules may occur. To manage firewall rules by group policy rather than by device, it is suggested to enable the 'Manage Firewall Rules on Balance and MAX devices' option at the group level in the InControl2 Web Portal before importing the configuration file. If issues persist, contacting the InControl2 team for support may be necessary.\n\n## Document_3\n\nWhen using RADIUS for authentication on Pepwave BRMini and BRMAX devices connected through a Pepwave Balance One VPN, the RADIUS server sees the client IP address as the WAN IP of the Balance One due to NAT. This can cause issues with assigning admin rights since all requests appear to come from the same IP. To resolve this, it is recommended to disable NAT for the VPN, which will allow the RADIUS server to see the actual remote source IPs instead of the WAN IP of the core balance.\n\n## Document_4\n\nWhen using RADIUS for authentication on Pepwave BRMini and BRMAX devices, the client IP address reported to the RADIUS server is that of the Pepwave Balance One, which acts as a VPN concentrator. This behavior complicates the assignment of admin rights to the Mini's and MAX's, as all requests appear to come from the same IP address.

    "query": "How does the use of different SpeedFusion Cloud tunnels on a Pepwave MBX affect Netflix connectivity, and what factors related to IP addressing and routing should a technician consider when troubleshooting Netflix access issues?",
    "answer": "When using SpeedFusion Cloud on a Pepwave MBX with multiple tunnels, the Default tunnel routes traffic through the MBX's cellular connections using ISP-provided IP addresses, which are less likely to be on Netflix's proxy filter blacklist. In contrast, the FEC tunnel routes traffic through the SpeedFusion Cloud hub, which provides different break-out IP addresses within AWS infrastructure. These IPs are more likely to be blocked by Netflix, leading to connectivity issues. Therefore, Netflix access may work over the Default tunnel but can be blocked when using the FEC tunnel.

To enable IP forwarding, users need to access the WAN connection settings and click on the question mark icon for guidance on the next steps.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe Peplink Balance 30 does not have a limit on the number of SIP endpoints that can be registered. If there are issues with registering more than 20 endpoints, it is recommended to capture a diagnostic report from the Balance while the issue occurs and submit it for support review.\n\n## Document_4\n\nChanging the LAN IP address on a Peplink Balance 310 from 192.168.1.41 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (/24) to 192.168.1.41 with a subnet mask of 255.254.0.0 (/15) is not a valid configuration, as 192.168.x.x is a Class C network which supports a maximum of /24. For a /15 subnet mask, a Class A network configuration would be required.\n\n## Document_5\n\nTo enable full network access for a remote PC connected via L2TP VPN to a Peplink Balance 30, it is necessary to adjust the firewall settings. Specifically, an inbound firewall rule should be created that allows traffic from the VPN source (the LAN subnet) to the destination (the entire LAN or specific devices) with the action set to allow. This rule should be enabled and configured to apply to the WAN connection used for the VPN.\n\n## Document_6\n\nTo ensure that only VOIP traffic goes out through the T1 connection on a Peplink Balance 305, the outbound policy should be configured to use ANY as the source for the 5060 and RTP ports. Additionally, it is important to check the firmware version (6.2.0) and the Quality of Service (QoS) settings, as well as whether the device is in compatibility mode. The reliability of the Comcast connection should also be considered, as it may have intermittent issues affecting performance.\n\n## Document_7\n\nFor load balancing and failover of two 15Mb DSL connections with 15 users and 50 devices including VoIP and VPN support, the PepLink Balance 030 may not be adequate as it is recommended for up to 25 simultaneous users/devices. The Balance One is suggested as a more suitable option for this configuration.\n\n## Document_8\n\nFor live streaming with increased bandwidth, the Pepwave MAX On-The-Go or MAX 700 are suitable mobile routers that provide more bandwidth through multiple sessions or streams and offer instant fail-over between USB modems. To bond multiple USB modems for a single stream, SpeedFusion VPN bonding technology is required, necessitating a second SpeedFusion-enabled device at the headquarters or data center, with the Peplink Balance 380 being a recommended choice for this purpose.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe user is experiencing limited wireless bandwidth, with no device exceeding 5Mbps download speed despite having a 32Mbps line and a 5Mbps fiber line connected through a Peplink Balance 310. The setup is in bridge mode, and the user has tested the connection directly through the ATT 32Mbps router, achieving a maximum of 6Mbps. The office environment is large and contains many walls, which may impact wireless signal strength and speed.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo troubleshoot low wireless speeds when using a Peplink Balance 310 with a 32Mbps ATT WAN, it is recommended to connect a laptop directly to the WAN for a speed test, and then connect the WAN to an AP One and test again with the same laptop. This will help measure the effective bandwidth available over Wi-Fi. It is noted that Wi-Fi performance may yield lower speeds due to environmental factors such as walls and the layout of the office space.\n\n## Document_11\n\nIncontrol and InControl2 are distinct platforms, and there is currently no automated method for migrating devices from Incontrol to InControl2; the migration process must be performed manually.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo verify if the Peplink Balance 310X supports IP passthrough on WAN and cellular, it is recommended to enable the Share Drop-In IP feature if there is insufficient public IP availability, such as when using a /30 subnet for the Drop-in WAN. Non Drop-in WANs also support /30 subnets without issues.\n\n## Document_13\n\nWhen using L2TP VPN on a Peplink Balance 30, it is normal for the remote PC to initially appear isolated from the rest of the network, indicated by a padlock icon. To enable access to the entire network from the remote PC, it is important to review the Internal Network Firewall Rules in the admin panel and ensure that there are no Deny rules that could be blocking access.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo ensure that only VoIP traffic uses the T1 connection while all other traffic utilizes the Comcast connection on a Peplink Balance 305, it is recommended to create a separate VLAN for the VoIP network. Outbound policies should be configured to route traffic based on the VoIP network address, using UDP protocol, and specifying the destination as the VoIP provider's feature server IP or domain via port 5060, along with RTP ports in another policy. The algorithm for these policies should be set to either Priority or Enforced. Additionally, all switch ports need to be tagged with the VLAN ID (10) for the VoIP phones, and the inbound firewall should allow UDP traffic from the feature server IP on port 5060 and RTP ports.\n\n## Document_15\n\nTo achieve better bandwidth for live streaming, using a Pepwave Max On-The-Go 3G/4G Router with Load Balancing and SpeedFusion is recommended. The traffic should be routed across the SpeedFusion VPN tunnel to a Peplink device located at a headquarters or datacenter, which will then connect to streaming services like Dacast or Livestream.\n\n## Document_16\n\nFor live streaming business requiring more bandwidth than a single USB modem can provide, a balancing and bonding router is recommended. The Pepwave Max On-The-Go 3G/4G Router with Load Balancing and SpeedFusion technology is suitable for achieving throughput of 35 to 50 Mbps. Further information can be found in the provided article link.\n\n## Document_17\n\nIn a setup with a Peplink Balance 310 and multiple access points, if wireless devices are experiencing limited download speeds (e.g., 5Mbps), it is important to check for potential issues such as Wi-Fi congestion on the 2.4GHz band. Utilizing Wi-Fi channel analyzers can help identify congestion. Additionally, running simultaneous speed tests on multiple devices may provide insight into bandwidth distribution and performance.\n\n## Document_18\n\nTo resolve the issue of AP Ones showing a red icon in InControl 2, it is important to ensure that they are running on the most current firmware version. The recommended firmware for the AP One is version 3.5.2 build 1537. If updating the firmware does not resolve the issue, opening a support ticket with Peplink is advised for further assistance.\n\n",

    "query": "How do antenna configurations and MIMO technology impact the performance and reliability of Pepwave routers across various models, and what are the best practices for optimizing antenna setups for models like the Balance 20X with Cat 18 modems and the BR1 Mini?",
    "answer": "Antenna configuration and MIMO technology are critical for maximizing the performance and reliability of Pepwave routers. MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) technology, found across several Pepwave models including the BR1 Mini, BR1 MK2, and others, uses multiple antennas for simultaneous data streams, enhancing speed and signal reliability. For the Balance 20X with a Cat 18 modem, optimal performance can be achieved by using either a four-element LTE antenna like the Puma-401 or a pair of 2x2 MIMO antennas. Adding vertical separation between antennas is recommended, as it provides better signal diversity and reduces interference compared to simply rotating antennas. In marginal signal areas, using two directional 2x2 5G MIMO antennas spaced three feet apart vertically, with one rotated 45 degrees, can further improve reception. For models like the BR1 Mini, having dual cellular antennas supports effective MIMO operation, improving speed and reliability. Overall, proper antenna selection (matching modem category and carrier capabilities), appropriate physical separation, and leveraging MIMO technology are best practices to optimize router performance and reliability.",

This allows the B580 to be integrated into the existing network setup, enabling the addition of 4 additional WAN connections to load balance traffic from the Cisco router across those links.\n\n## Document_3\n\nTo monitor the WAN status of a Pepwave Express router using SNMP, the standard MIB can be utilized, specifically the object called ifOperStatus with the OID 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8. An SNMP Walk can be performed to check the status.\n\n## Document_4\n\nIn a setup using a Pepwave 320 with firmware 5.3.12 and 1 to 1 NAT, if firewall rules are not functioning as expected, it is important to ensure that all rules are placed in the 'Inbound Firewall Rules' section with a default deny all rule. To open specific ports, a rule must be added that selects the appropriate WAN, sets the source and destination IP to any/any, and specifies the port to be opened. This configuration is crucial for controlling access to the mapped private IP addresses.\n\n## Document_5\n\nIt is possible to upgrade a Pepwave router directly from firmware version 5.4.9 to 8.0, but it is recommended to first upgrade to version 6.3 to avoid potential issues. A firmware key is required for the upgrade process, and the configuration of the B310 will remain intact during the upgrade. However, after upgrading to firmware 8.0, PepVPN tunnels cannot be formed with devices running firmware 6.1 or older unless those devices are also updated.\n\n## Document_6\n\nIn a lab environment with a B310 and B1350 running firmware 7.0.1, traffic splitting across multiple links is being configured, but the second and third tunnels are inactive. The configuration shows that WAN3 is prioritized for route 3, but traffic is still defaulting to route 1, indicating that the outbound policy may not be functioning as intended. The presence of a 0.0.0.0/0 route is noted as potentially problematic, and it is suggested to check for other devices in the same OSPF domain that may be advertising this route. Additionally, obtaining a Diagnostic Report from both devices is recommended for further investigation.\n\n## Document_7\n\nTo bridge two separate LANs using a Pepwave B380 and B210, the B380 is configured with a static route for the camera LAN (10.20.30.0/24) pointing to the B210's WAN1 address (198.42.231.242). The B210 is set up with IP forwarding enabled and NAT disabled, with its LAN configured to provide DHCP addresses in the range of 10.20.30.1 to 10.20.30.100. Firewall rules on the B380 allow inbound traffic from both the camera LAN and the local LAN. However, communication from the B380 LAN to the B210 LAN fails unless the PC's gateway is set to the B210's WAN1 address, indicating a potential issue with the B380's routing or firewall configuration.\n\n## Document_8\n\nTo monitor WAN link status using SNMP on Pepwave devices, the relevant OID is .1.3.6.1.4.1.23695.2.1.2.1.3, which indicates various states such as disabled, disconnected, connected, connecting, activating, and health-check-fail. This allows for tracking the status of the WAN connection beyond just traffic metrics.\n\n## Document_9\n\nIt is not possible to convert a configuration backup file from a Pepwave B710 to upload it to a Pepwave B300.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Pepwave 210 revision 1 hardware is rated for a maximum throughput of 50 Mbps. If the user has revision 2 or later, they should open a support ticket for further assistance regarding performance issues.\n\n## Document_11\n\nTo establish a PepVPN site-to-site connection between two Pepwave UBR devices, it is important to forward both the handshake port (typically 32015 TCP, but 32016 can be used) and the data port 4500 UDP in the firewall/NAT settings. Forwarding the handshake port for both TCP and UDP can also facilitate the VPN connection. Ensuring that these ports are correctly forwarded is crucial for successful connectivity.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo remove a Pepwave UBR from an InControl account, simply resetting the device to factory defaults is not sufficient. Instead, it is recommended to power up the device with no external connectivity, log in locally, and disable InControl management. This will prevent the device from calling home or being managed by InControl, allowing for local use of the unit, albeit without the features provided by InControl.\n\n## Document_13\n\nTo create more than two IPSEC VPN links from a PepWave Max700 device, an additional PepVPN license is required. This license can be purchased from a Peplink Partner or through the Peplink Store.\n\n## Document_14\n\nIf a LAN-connected device is showing significantly slower speeds compared to a WiFi connection, it is advisable to first change the LAN cable, as the quality of the cable can affect performance. Ethernet connections can have four states: not connected, connected at full line speed, connected but poorly negotiated at reduced speed, or connected with transmission errors leading to greatly reduced speeds.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Virtual WAN Activation License allows users to create a virtual WAN on a specific VLAN using either WAN or LAN interfaces, providing flexibility beyond the physical WAN ports. This license is distinct from the WAN Port Activation License, which enables the use of an additional physical WAN port, and the Failover License, which allows for Wi-Fi WAN or LAN port use for Ethernet WAN. Devices on PrimeCare can utilize one Virtual WAN license for free, with the option to purchase additional licenses for up to three virtual WANs. The license is compatible with PrimeCare models (excluding UBR LTE and Transit Mini) and requires Firmware 8.3.0 to function. Configuration involves accessing the Web Admin, activating the license, and binding virtual WAN interfaces to either physical WAN or LAN ports, with specific steps outlined for each method.\n\n## Document_16\n\nWhen monitoring remote devices' PepVPN connection status via SNMP on a FusionHub VM running firmware 6.3.2s002, it has been observed that the SNMP table implementation may have issues when multiple peers fail within a single profile. Specifically, when a second device goes offline, the FusionHub drops the entire index for that peer, resulting in fewer table entries than expected. For instance, if there are 19 peers in a profile but two peers go offline, only 17 entries may be present in the SNMP table, indicating a potential bug in the SNMP implementation or a firmware-related issue.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo enable PoE output on the B30 Pro, a 48VDC power supply is required. It is not possible to use a 24VDC input power for this purpose, even if there are sufficient amps available.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe PoE options for Peplink devices, including the B30 Pro, are compliant with the 802.3af/at standards once activated with a suitable power supply. If using a proprietary PoE configuration, it is recommended to use the device's recommended PoE injector instead of relying on the standard PoE support.\n\n## Document_19\n\nTo configure a Pepwave 580 model as a load balancer for 5 WANs while maintaining a Cisco ISR router for VPN and other functions, it is important to utilize the Drop-In mode settings. Users can access these settings by clicking on the \"?\" in the drop-in mode section under Network > LAN > Network Settings to share the Drop-In IP appropriately.\n\n## Document_20\n\nUpgrading from firmware version 5.4.9 build 1564 to 6.3.3 on a Pepwave device can be done without issues, and it does not require incremental upgrades. A free license key is necessary for the upgrade from the 5.x series. The latest firmware version available for the B310 Hardware version 3 is 8.0.0.\n\n## Document_21\n\nIn a lab environment with a B310 and B1350 running firmware version 7.0.1, traffic is intended to be split across three links based on source/destination policies. However, the second and third tunnels are inactive, and traffic is defaulting to route 1, indicating that the policies are not functioning as expected. The placement of the routing rules may affect their behavior, with a suggestion that they should be positioned below the PepVPN route section. Additionally, failure detection settings were adjusted to minimize traffic across the links, with only minimal ping traffic being sent.\n\n## Document_22\n\nIn a network setup where a Pepwave B210 router is used to bridge two separate LANs (198.42.231.0/24 and 198.42.232.0/24), it is important to ensure that the B210 is configured correctly for traffic routing. If NAT is enabled on the B210's WAN1, devices on LAN B can communicate with LAN A, but devices on LAN A will not be able to initiate communication with LAN B unless the B210 has a live NAT session. To facilitate communication from LAN A to LAN B, IP forwarding should be set on the B210's WAN1, allowing the B210 to forward traffic directly to devices on LAN B without relying on NAT sessions.\n\n## Document_23\n\nTo bridge two separate LANs, a static route must be configured on the primary router (B380) to direct traffic to the secondary router (210) that connects to the camera LAN. The B380 has a static route set for the 198.42.232.0/24 network pointing to the 210's WAN1 IP address (198.42.231.242). However, if the B380 is sending requests to an incorrect IP address (198.42.231.254), it indicates a potential misconfiguration in the routing table or an issue with the device's response to the traceroute. The 210 acts as a DHCP server for its LAN and should allow devices on the 198.42.231.0 network to communicate with devices on the 198.42.232.0 network if properly configured.\n\n## Document_24\n\nTo bridge two separate LANs, ensure that the primary LAN router (380) has a static route configured for the secondary LAN (198.42.232.0/24) pointing to the WAN1 address of the bridging router (210) at 198.42.231.242. The bridging router (210) should be configured with its WAN1 connected to the primary LAN and functioning as a DHCP server for its own LAN (198.42.232.0/24). Devices on the primary LAN should have their gateway set to the primary router's address (198.42.231.124) to facilitate communication with devices on the secondary LAN. If communication fails, further diagnostics such as ping tests and traceroutes should be conducted to identify connectivity issues.\n\n## Document_25\n\nTo bridge two separate LANs using a Pepwave 210 router, the WAN1 of the 210 should be configured with an IP address on the primary LAN, and it should have a static route set on the primary LAN router (380) pointing to the 210's WAN1 address for the secondary LAN. The 210 acts as a DHCP server for its own LAN, allowing devices to acquire IP addresses. However, if devices on the primary LAN cannot communicate with devices on the secondary LAN, it may indicate an issue with the static route configuration or firewall settings. The static route should specify the correct destination network and gateway for proper routing between the two LANs.\n\n## Document_26\n\nTo bridge two separate LANs using a Pepwave 210 router, the WAN1 of the 210 should be configured with an IP address within the primary LAN's subnet, and a static route should be added on the primary LAN router (380) pointing to the 210's WAN1 address for the secondary LAN's subnet. The 210 acts as a DHCP server for its own LAN, allowing devices connected to it to acquire IP addresses. However, communication issues may arise if the static route is not functioning correctly or if there are firewall rules preventing traffic between the two subnets.\n\n## Document_27\n\nTo bridge two separate LANs using a Peplink Balance 210, ensure that the WAN1 port of the 210 is connected directly to the LAN of the primary router (Balance 380) without any switches in between. A static route should be configured on the Balance 380 for the 198.42.232.0/24 network pointing to the 210's WAN1 IP address (198.42.231.242). If communication issues persist, testing connectivity by pinging a known IP address from the Balance 380's LAN interface can help diagnose the problem.\n\n## Document_28\n\nTo monitor WAN link status using SNMP on a Peplink device, the private MIB is utilized, but it may not provide the link status when the internet connection goes down, only showing traffic statistics. A SNMP walk can reveal various OIDs related to the device, including its identification and interface details. However, specific OIDs for WAN link status may not be present, indicating a limitation in monitoring capabilities for link status directly through SNMP.\n\n",

To facilitate communication from LAN A to LAN B, IP forwarding should be set on the B210's WAN1, allowing the B210 to forward traffic directly to devices on LAN B without relying on NAT sessions.",
      "To bridge two separate LANs, a static route must be configured on the primary router (B380) to direct traffic to the secondary router (210) that connects to the camera LAN. The B380 has a static route set for the 198.42.232.0/24 network pointing to the 210's WAN1 IP address (198.42.231.242). However, if the B380 is sending requests to an incorrect IP address (198.42.231.254), it indicates a potential misconfiguration in the routing table or an issue with the device's response to the traceroute. The 210 acts as a DHCP server for its LAN and should allow devices on the 198.42.231.0 network to communicate with devices on the 198.42.232.0 network if properly configured.",
      "To bridge two separate LANs, ensure that the primary LAN router (380) has a static route configured for the secondary LAN (198.42.232.0/24) pointing to the WAN1 address of the bridging router (210) at 198.42.231.242. The bridging router (210) should be configured with its WAN1 connected to the primary LAN and functioning as a DHCP server for its own LAN (198.42.232.0/24). Devices on the primary LAN should have their gateway set to the primary router's address (198.42.231.124) to facilitate communication with devices on the secondary LAN. If communication fails, further diagnostics such as ping tests and traceroutes should be conducted to identify connectivity issues.",
      "To bridge two separate LANs using a Pepwave 210 router, the WAN1 of the 210 should be configured with an IP address on the primary LAN, and it should have a static route set on the primary LAN router (380) pointing to the 210's WAN1 address for the secondary LAN. The 210 acts as a DHCP server for its own LAN, allowing devices to acquire IP addresses. However, if devices on the primary LAN cannot communicate with devices on the secondary LAN, it may indicate an issue with the static route configuration or firewall settings. The static route should specify the correct destination network and gateway for proper routing between the two LANs.",

The 210 acts as a DHCP server for its own LAN, allowing devices connected to it to acquire IP addresses. However, communication issues may arise if the static route is not functioning correctly or if there are firewall rules preventing traffic between the two subnets.",
      "To bridge two separate LANs using a Peplink Balance 210, ensure that the WAN1 port of the 210 is connected directly to the LAN of the primary router (Balance 380) without any switches in between. A static route should be configured on the Balance 380 for the 198.42.232.0/24 network pointing to the 210's WAN1 IP address (198.42.231.242).

      "To monitor WAN link status using SNMP on a Peplink device, the private MIB is utilized, but it may not provide the link status when the internet connection goes down, only showing traffic statistics. A SNMP walk can reveal various OIDs related to the device, including its identification and interface details. However, specific OIDs for WAN link status may not be present, indicating a limitation in monitoring capabilities for link status directly through SNMP."

After applying these settings, users should be able to access the Starlink dish's management interface.\n\n## Document_9\n\nTo manage a Starlink dish connected to a Peplink router in DHCP/NAT mode, the Peplink router must be configured with the management IP address in the range of 192.168.100.2 to 192.168.100.254, allowing access to the dish at 192.168.100.1. This configuration requires the use of special firmware version 8.1.1s118, which is available for various Peplink products. Users have reported varying success accessing the management interface through different web browsers, with some experiencing issues in Chrome and Brave but successfully accessing it in Microsoft Edge.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo connect a Starlink dish to a Peplink Balance One router and manage it via the management app, the dish's IP address 192.168.100.1 needs to be passed through to WAN1. Users have attempted various configurations including setting outbound policies for all WANs, adding 192.168.100.1 as an additional IP, and creating NAT and firewall rules, but have faced issues with connectivity and management access. The special firmware allows for enabling a Management IP Address, but users are encountering a '404 Not Found' error when trying to access the management interface at the specified URL, indicating potential misconfiguration or access issues.\n\n## Document_11\n\nTo set up a Peplink Balance 20X with both CenturyLink and Starlink for optimal connectivity, the CenturyLink modem should connect to the Peplink Balance 20X via an Ethernet cord, and the Starlink router should connect to the Peplink using an Ethernet adapter. A USB dongle may be required for the Ethernet connection from the CenturyLink modem to the Peplink. The Peplink Balance 20X will facilitate the connection to a work computer via Ethernet and can also provide Wi-Fi connectivity for phones. Maintaining a Primecare subscription is necessary for utilizing SpeedFusion Cloud service, and the amount of data needed will depend on the traffic routed through the Peplink device.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo set up a Peplink Balance 20X with both CenturyLink and Starlink internet connections, the CenturyLink modem should connect to the Peplink via Ethernet, and the Starlink router can also connect to the Peplink using an Ethernet adapter. A USB dongle may be required for the CenturyLink modem connection. The Peplink Balance 20X requires a PrimeCare subscription to maintain SpeedFusion Cloud service, and users can also consider SpeedFusionSolo for potentially lower costs. It is important to keep the PrimeCare subscription active to avoid losing Fusion link functionality. Additionally, users may need to adjust the MTU settings for reliable connections, depending on the internet service used.\n\n## Document_13\n\nTo configure a Peplink router to manage a Starlink dish via IP 192.168.100.1, the WAN connection settings should be set to DHCP, and a management IP address within the range of 192.168.100.2 to 192.168.100.254 should be entered. The subnet mask should remain unchanged, and the settings must be saved and applied to activate the feature. This configuration allows access to the Starlink dish management interface.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo manage devices like the Starlink dish or an AT&T DSL modem through a Peplink router, the WAN connection should be set to DHCP mode, and a management IP address within the appropriate subnet must be assigned. For the Starlink dish, the management IP can range from 192.168.100.2 to 192.168.100.254, allowing access via 192.168.100.1. For other devices, such as an AT&T DSL modem, a different IP within the same subnet should be used, for example, using 192.168.3.2 to access a modem at 192.168.3.1.\n\n## Document_15\n\nTo manage a Starlink dish connected to a Peplink Balance router, it is necessary to pass through the IP address 192.168.100.1 to WAN1. Users have attempted various configurations including setting outbound policies for all WANs, adding the IP as an additional IP, creating NAT rules, and adjusting firewall settings, but have been unsuccessful in achieving connectivity to the Starlink admin interface. The Starlink device may restrict access to its admin interface to clients within its subnet, which could be a reason for the inability to ping the address except during the initial boot-up.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo manage a Starlink dish connected to a Peplink router, an outbound policy rule should be created with the source set to Any and the destination set to the IP address 192.168.100.1, using the Enforced algorithm directed to the Starlink WAN. This configuration allows LAN clients to access the management app for the Starlink dish.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo connect a Starlink dish to a Peplink router and manage it via the management app, the dish's IP address (192.168.100.1) needs to be accessible through WAN1. Attempts to configure this include setting outbound policies for all WANs, adding the IP as an additional IP, creating NAT rules, and adjusting firewall settings. However, the IP is only reachable during the initial boot of the dish, indicating it may not respond to pings at other times, complicating the management setup.\n\n## Document_18\n\nTo manage a Starlink dish connected to a Peplink Balance router, it may be necessary to pass through the IP address 192.168.100.1 to WAN1. This can potentially be achieved by adding a Static Route for the 192.168.100.0/24 subnet to the gateway IP of the Starlink interface. Additionally, it is noted that running firmware version 8.1.1 may be required for certain features to function correctly in drop-in mode.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe Starlink dish initially boots up with a gateway IP of 192.168.1.1, which then changes to 100.82.xxx.yyy with a default gateway of 100.27.aaa.bbb after renegotiation. The subnet mask used is 255.192.0.0. When attempting to set a static route, an error occurs indicating that the gateway 100.82.xxx.yyy is not on the local network. The WAN is configured in DHCP/NAT mode rather than drop-in mode.\n\n## Document_20\n\nTo connect a Starlink dish to a Peplink Balance router and manage it through a LAN client, it is suggested to add a route to the 192.168.100.1 address with a netmask of 0.0.0.0 on the WAN interface, or to add the entire 192.168.100.0/24 subnet. This allows the router to broadcast an ARP request for 192.168.100.1 and communicate directly with its MAC address. However, Peplink devices do not allow static routes on WAN interfaces, and outbound policies may result in packets being tagged with the default router's MAC address, which could prevent communication if the Starlink hardware only responds to its own MAC. An alternative solution involves using a spare WAN port with a switch to connect the Starlink and configure it for OOB communication.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo manage a Starlink dish connected to a Peplink Balance router, it is necessary to pass through the IP address 192.168.100.1 to the WAN1 interface. Attempts to configure this using outbound policies, NAT rules, and firewall settings may not succeed if the device does not respond to pings or is hidden from the network. Using the CLI interface, one can ping the IP from the WAN interface and check the ARP table to determine connectivity. If the device is unreachable, a static route may be required. FusionHub supports WAN static routes, and alternative methods such as using a secondary WAN interface or bridging with another router may be necessary to manage the Starlink device securely.\n\n",

    "documents_text": "## Document_2\n\nFor high availability (HA) configurations with Peplink Balance 710 devices, using an active/active setup is recommended over an active/passive VRRP HA-pair due to the slow failover times associated with VRRP, which can exceed 30 seconds. In cases where compliance requires an active/passive configuration, VRRP may still be used, but it is considered cumbersome and outdated compared to active/active configurations that allow for faster failover and better resource utilization.\n\n## Document_3\n\nPeplink's high availability (HA) feature operates on a master/slave architecture, where one router is designated as the master and the other as a backup. The backup router remains inactive while the master is operational, only becoming active if the master fails. This implementation does not support a peer-to-peer relationship where both routers can independently manage their own WANs and VLANs while providing backup for each other. The HA configuration requires synchronization of settings between the master and slave, which is optional but necessary for the slave to be prepared for activation in case of a master failure. If synchronization is not enabled, the slave must be manually configured to match the master.\n\n## Document_4\n\nFor implementing a 1+1 Backup with Peplink Balance devices or MAX 700/HD in active-standby mode, the master device handles LAN traffic until it fails, at which point the slave device takes over. Peplink Balance 210 and above support High Availability (HA) failover using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), where periodic VRRP advertisement packets are sent from the master to a multicast address. If these packets are not received within a specified time, the slave assumes the master’s responsibilities. Both devices must be on the same subnet and share the same HA group identifier. Configuration involves setting up a virtual IP (VIP) as the default gateway for LAN hosts, and additional Ethernet switches are recommended to prevent a single point of failure. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave to automatically adopt changes from the master, or it can be configured manually. The failover typically occurs within 10-15 seconds, and both devices should connect to the Internet in the same mode, either NAT or Drop-in mode, with specific configurations for each.\n\n## Document_5\n\nIn a 1+1 backup configuration using Peplink Balance devices or MAX 700/HD, High Availability (HA) failover is achieved through the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). The master device sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets to specific multicast addresses, and if these packets are not received within a defined time interval, the slave device assumes the master’s responsibilities. The configuration requires both devices to be on the same subnet and to use the same HA group identifier. The virtual IP address (VIP) serves as the default gateway for all LAN hosts. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave unit to automatically apply changes from the master unit, or it can be configured manually. Failover typically occurs within 10-15 seconds, and both devices must be connected to the internet in the same mode, either NAT or Drop-in mode.\n\n## Document_6\n\nPeplink Balance devices, specifically models 210 and above, and MAX 700/HD, support High Availability (HA) failover using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). In an HA setup, the master device sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets to specific multicast addresses, and if these packets are not received within a predefined interval, the slave device takes over the master’s responsibilities. The configuration requires both devices to be on the same subnet and use the same HA group identifier. The setup includes assigning a virtual IP address (VIP) as the default gateway for all LAN hosts. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave unit to automatically obtain changes from the master unit, or it can be configured manually. Failover typically occurs within 10-15 seconds, and both devices must be connected to the internet in the same mode, either NAT or Drop-in mode, with the VIP set as the default gateway for devices behind the Balance.\n\n## Document_7\n\nTo implement High Availability (HA) with Peplink Balance devices or MAX 700/HD, a pair of devices must operate in active-standby mode, utilizing Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) for failover. The master device sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets, and if these are not received within a predefined interval, the slave device takes over. The devices must be on the same subnet and share the same HA group identifier. Configuration involves setting up a virtual IP address (VIP) as the default gateway for LAN hosts, and separate Ethernet switches are recommended to avoid single points of failure. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave unit to automatically obtain settings from the master unit, or it can be configured manually. Failover typically occurs within 10-15 seconds, and both devices should be connected to the internet in the same mode, either NAT or Drop-in mode.\n\n## Document_8\n\nFor implementing a 1+1 Backup with Peplink Balance devices or MAX 700/HD in active-standby mode, both devices must be configured to support High Availability (HA) failover using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). The master device sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets, and if these are not received within a predefined interval, the slave device takes over. Both devices must be on the same subnet and use the same HA group identifier. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave unit to automatically apply changes from the master every 5 minutes. The failover typically occurs within 10-15 seconds, and the virtual IP (VIP) serves as the default gateway for all hosts on the LAN segment. In NAT mode, the VIP must be set as the default gateway for connected devices, while in Drop-in mode, no additional configuration is needed for hosts in the LAN segment.\n\n## Document_9\n\nTo implement a 1+1 Backup with Peplink Balance devices or MAX 700/HD in active-standby mode, both devices must be configured to support High Availability (HA) failover using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP).

Failover typically occurs within 10-15 seconds, and both units should be connected to the Internet in the same mode, either NAT or Drop-in mode.\n\n## Document_10\n\nHigh Availability (HA) failover is supported on the Peplink MAX BR1 starting from Firmware 7, allowing a slave unit to take over the role of a master unit in case of failure, providing hardware redundancy. HA failover utilizes the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), where a heartbeat is sent from the master to the slave device. Both BR1 routers must be connected to the same LAN for VRRP to function, and they can use separate cellular WAN connections. Configuration requires setting the same HA group number on both devices, defining a Virtual IP address that serves as the default gateway for the LAN, and assigning additional IP addresses to each router. The configuration process involves logging into the master device, enabling HA, and applying the settings, followed by configuring the slave device to synchronize settings with the master.\n\n## Document_11\n\nHigh availability mode on Peplink routers, also known as Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), allows for seamless failover between two routers configured in master and slave mode. In this setup, one router (the master) handles all connectivity, while the other (the slave) remains on standby. If the master router experiences a failure, the slave router automatically takes over within approximately 15 seconds, ensuring continuous internet connectivity. The demonstration involved two Peplink Balance 380 routers, with an active ping to Google's public DNS to monitor connectivity. When the master router was turned off, the pings stopped, but once the slave router assumed master status, the pings resumed, demonstrating the effectiveness of the high availability setup. The process also includes the ability for the master router to regain control once it is powered back on, reverting the roles of the routers accordingly.\n\n## Document_12\n\nHigh Availability (HA) mode, also known as HA mode, provides hardware redundancy by allowing a slave unit to take over the role of a master unit in the event of a failure. This failover mechanism is based on the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), which sends a heartbeat signal from the master device to the slave device. If the heartbeat is lost due to hardware failure or disconnection, the slave unit assumes the master role. The setup involves configuring two Peplink Balance 20X devices, where the master device is set up first by enabling HA mode, selecting the master role, and configuring a virtual IP address that serves as the default gateway for connected hosts. The slave device is then configured to sync its settings with the master either automatically or manually, ensuring it has a different LAN IP address. The failover process typically takes 10 to 15 seconds, during which all line connections are re-established. Successful configuration can be verified through the web admin dashboard of the slave device, which will indicate that HA mode is enabled.\n\n## Document_13\n\nWhen using a pair of Balance 710s as a high availability (HA) pair, the failover process can result in significant downtime due to the lack of real session synchronization, with outages exceeding 30 seconds. An alternative approach is to configure two independent Balance 710s and connect each branch office to both devices, which may require more configuration work but can lead to faster failover. The use of OSPF routes and path costs can also influence the failover time and network performance.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe high availability feature of the Peplink Balance 20X can cause issues with cable modems, particularly those from Comcast, due to the changing of the Ethernet MAC address on the WAN port. This can lead to the modem becoming unresponsive, as it is sensitive to MAC address changes. The MAC address used during high availability is an unassigned IANA MAC address (00:00:5e:01:01:fa), which is not appropriate for this function. The expected virtual MAC address for VRRP should be 00:00:5e:00:01:fa. When high availability is enabled, the WAN port may show a private IP address instead of the public IP, and the WAN status may indicate down due to DNS test failures, suggesting that the modem is not passing traffic from the router. Packet captures during this time may yield unexpected results, such as capturing LAN traffic instead of WAN traffic.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20X high availability feature has limitations in its VRRP implementation, allowing a device to be a master or backup for only one network, which may not meet the needs for more complex configurations. Issues with the cable modem may arise when high availability is enabled, potentially due to the WAN port using a virtual MAC address, resulting in a private IP address instead of the expected public IP. The WAN status may show as down if the DNS test fails, indicating that the modem is not passing traffic from the router. Packet captures during this time may yield unexpected results, such as capturing LAN traffic instead of WAN traffic.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo implement a 1+1 Backup using Peplink Balance devices or MAX 700/HD, both devices must operate in active-standby mode, utilizing High Availability (HA) failover based on Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). The master device sends periodic VRRP advertisement packets to a multicast address, and the slave device takes over if these packets are not received within a specified interval. Both devices must be on the same subnet and share the same HA group identifier. The configuration requires setting a virtual IP (VIP) as the default gateway for LAN hosts, and additional Ethernet switches are recommended to avoid a single point of failure. Configuration Sync can be enabled for the slave unit to automatically apply changes from the master unit, or the slave can be configured manually using an exported configuration file.

      "For high availability (HA) configurations with Peplink Balance 710 devices, using an active/active setup is recommended over an active/passive VRRP HA-pair due to the slow failover times associated with VRRP, which can exceed 30 seconds. In cases where compliance requires an active/passive configuration, VRRP may still be used, but it is considered cumbersome and outdated compared to active/active configurations that allow for faster failover and better resource utilization.",
      "Peplink's high availability (HA) feature operates on a master/slave architecture, where one router is designated as the master and the other as a backup. The backup router remains inactive while the master is operational, only becoming active if the master fails. This implementation does not support a peer-to-peer relationship where both routers can independently manage their own WANs and VLANs while providing backup for each other. The HA configuration requires synchronization of settings between the master and slave, which is optional but necessary for the slave to be prepared for activation in case of a master failure. If synchronization is not enabled, the slave must be manually configured to match the master.",

Both BR1 routers must be connected to the same LAN for VRRP to function, and they can use separate cellular WAN connections. Configuration requires setting the same HA group number on both devices, defining a Virtual IP address that serves as the default gateway for the LAN, and assigning additional IP addresses to each router.

      "High availability mode on Peplink routers, also known as Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), allows for seamless failover between two routers configured in master and slave mode. In this setup, one router (the master) handles all connectivity, while the other (the slave) remains on standby. If the master router experiences a failure, the slave router automatically takes over within approximately 15 seconds, ensuring continuous internet connectivity. The demonstration involved two Peplink Balance 380 routers, with an active ping to Google's public DNS to monitor connectivity. When the master router was turned off, the pings stopped, but once the slave router assumed master status, the pings resumed, demonstrating the effectiveness of the high availability setup. The process also includes the ability for the master router to regain control once it is powered back on, reverting the roles of the routers accordingly.",

If the heartbeat is lost due to hardware failure or disconnection, the slave unit assumes the master role. The setup involves configuring two Peplink Balance 20X devices, where the master device is set up first by enabling HA mode, selecting the master role, and configuring a virtual IP address that serves as the default gateway for connected hosts. The slave device is then configured to sync its settings with the master either automatically or manually, ensuring it has a different LAN IP address.

The difference in speed between the internet router and the SOHO is not indicative of a malfunction but rather a result of the router's maximum capacity.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 can successfully ping and trace the printer, indicating it is reachable on the network. However, the printer does not consistently appear on the client list and is unresponsive to Wake-on-LAN requests, which may suggest that the printer does not support this function. The client list may not accurately reflect all connected devices, especially if they are only communicating on the local area network without Internet access. Restarting the router temporarily allows the printer to appear on the client list, but it subsequently disappears after a few minutes, indicating potential connectivity issues.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 router is experiencing issues with a wired printer that intermittently appears on the client list but is marked as inactive. The printer can be pinged from a PC and is visible in traceroute results, but it does not respond to Wake-on-LAN requests and disappears from the client list after a few minutes. Wired PCs can print to the printer, but Wi-Fi devices, including a phone, cannot detect it. The printer lacks a web UI, and there are no VLANs configured on the network.

    "query": "If a user with a Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 router upgrades their ISP connection to 1Gbps but still experiences speeds of only 100–120 Mbps on both wired and wireless clients, what are the main reasons for this limitation, and what upgrade options are available for achieving higher throughput?",
    "answer": "The main reason for the speed limitation is the hardware throughput cap of the Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3, which is rated at 120 Mbps. This cap is determined by the device's hardware, not by software or configuration, so even with a 1Gbps ISP plan, the router cannot deliver speeds above its specified maximum. While real-world speeds may be even lower due to factors like WiFi interference, channel congestion, and the number of rules or special features enabled, the core throughput limit is set by the router's hardware. To achieve higher speeds, users should consider upgrading to a more powerful router. Peplink Balance One (supports up to 600 Mbps) and Balance 20X (supports up to 900 Mbps) are recommended for users needing faster connections. Actual speeds on these devices may still vary depending on network and environmental factors, but their higher throughput ratings are suitable for faster internet plans.",

      "In firmware version 3.6.0, the WDS (Wireless Distribution System) option is not supported. It is recommended to update to firmware version 3.6.1 to access this feature.",
      "To create a VPN connection between two Peplink units, such as the BPL 305 and BPL 310, it is important to refer to the user manual for detailed instructions. Additionally, if there is a router or firewall in front of the Peplink devices, port forwarding must be configured for the default protocols TCP 32015 and UDP 4500 to ensure proper connectivity.",
      "To upgrade a Peplink Balance One to the latest firmware version, it is necessary to first manually upgrade to an intermediate version, such as 8.1.0, before proceeding to the desired version, like 8.4.0. Attempting to upgrade directly from an older version may result in errors such as 'Invalid firmware image.'",
      "To automate speed tests for multiple WAN interfaces on a Peplink B20X, one can create local DNS entries that point to a consistent speed test server IP address. By setting outbound rules that match these DNS entries, the router can direct traffic to the desired WAN for testing without needing to change rules manually. This allows for running speed tests from a single server while maintaining the same destination, simplifying the process.",
      "When using a Balance 310 with a USB WAN port connected to a DeviceConnectorRugged, it is possible to manage another device on the WAN interface if DHCP is enabled on the Balance 310. This feature allows access to the web interface of the connected device from the LAN side. However, this functionality is not available when the WAN is configured with a static IP address. The feature was included in the production release starting from firmware version 8.1.2.",

      "To monitor events related to WAN interfaces on a PepLink Load Balancer 580 using SNMP v3, users can download the Peplink MIB file, which may provide additional information and options for event management. This can help in identifying specific WAN interface events instead of general device reboot events.",
      "The most recent API documentation available for Peplink devices is for firmware version 8.3.0, and there is currently no documentation released for version 8.4.0.",
      "The WAN 1 connection on a Peplink MAX BR2 may fail health checks due to intermittent issues with Starlink's DNS queries, which can drop packets occasionally, particularly during specific time windows. This issue was identified in firmware version 8.2.1 and was addressed in version 8.3.0. To troubleshoot, it is recommended to try different types of health checks, such as HTTP or ping, instead of relying solely on DNS lookups. Capturing and analyzing health check packets between the Peplink and Starlink can help identify the source of the problem.",
      "To resolve issues logging into a MAX BR1 MINI router when the password is rejected, users can utilize the remote web admin feature available through InControl to change the local password. Alternatively, they can edit system device settings at the group level in InControl to set a new password that will be pushed to the device.",
      "To monitor Peplink routers, specifically the Max BR1, using Solarwinds and SNMP, it is important to use the custom MIBs provided by Peplink. These MIBs will enable visibility of the cellular interfaces over SNMP, which is necessary for monitoring data usage and setting alerts in Solarwinds.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nThe Peplink Balance 310 5G does not currently support the NetFlow feature, but a firmware fix is planned to enable this functionality. The fix is expected to be included in the next general availability (GA) firmware release.\n\n## Document_2\n\nTo configure a Peplink Balance 310 5G to run traffic through SpeedFusion Cloud when the primary WAN connection goes down, set up the SpeedFusion Cloud connection to the nearest point of presence. Create an outbound policy named 'priority' with the wired WAN at the top of the list and SpeedFusion Cloud next, ensuring to tick the option to terminate sessions on link recovery before saving and applying the settings.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe Bandwidth Control feature on the PePLink Balance 710 is designed to manage traffic based on the source IP addresses or subnets of LAN and PPTP clients, allowing different bandwidth and traffic prioritization policies for user groups such as Manager, Staff, and Guest. It typically applies to internal (private) IP addresses rather than external (public) IP addresses, and does not restrict traffic to specific external sites. Currently, there is no functionality to shape traffic directed to particular external destinations, but this could be considered for future development.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Peplink Balance 380 supports a maximum of 50 concurrent OpenVPN connections, as stated in the documentation. This limit is not just a recommendation; it is a hard-coded restriction. If a 51st VPN user attempts to connect, they will be blocked from establishing a VPN connection until one of the existing users disconnects, as the device cannot handle more than the specified number of concurrent connections.\n\n## Document_5\n\nWhen configuring a Peplink Balance 580 with two WAN connections for outbound DNS resolution, it is important to note that the secondary DNS server will only be used if the primary DNS server is unresponsive. The DNS traffic analysis may show internal NATted IP addresses, such as 192.168.17.198, instead of the queried external web addresses or IPs. To gain better visibility into DNS queries and responses across the network, setting up a syslog server can be beneficial.\n\n## Document_6\n\nWhen aggregating multiple internet connections using a Peplink Balance 580, the type of speed test conducted can significantly impact the results, as browser-based tests typically utilize a single session and may not effectively leverage all available WAN connections. Satellite connections often have high latency (around 800ms on KA band), which can hinder performance compared to DSL connections that have lower latency (20-50ms). For optimal performance, it is suggested to use the satellite link as a backup only, as it can negatively affect the overall speed and latency of the load-balanced connections.\n\n## Document_7\n\nWhen aggregating multiple internet connections using a Peplink Balance 580, the inclusion of a satellite connection with high latency can negatively impact overall speed. Specifically, the satellite connection should not be aggregated with DSL lines, as the high latency of the satellite connection can slow down the entire SpeedFusion VPN tunnel. It is recommended to combine satellite connections only with other satellite connections, while landlines can be effectively combined with cellular connections for better performance.\n\n## Document_8\n\nTo route all SIP traffic through a T1 line with failover to a cable line on a Peplink Balance 580, outbound rules using IP addresses are recommended. Issues may arise when new devices connect to the network, as they can inadvertently use the T1 line, causing congestion for voice traffic. It is important to define outbound policies carefully and ensure that all devices are accounted for in the rules to maintain optimal performance.\n\n## Document_9\n\nTo allow both internal and external access to an NVR for IP CCTV cameras using a Peplink Balance Core, a local DNS record can be set up to resolve the domain name (e.g., abc.domain.com) to the internal IP address (e.g., 192.168.50.10) when accessed from within the local network. This setup prevents the traffic from being routed externally and back to the NVR. Additionally, user devices should be configured to obtain DHCP IP addresses from the Balance Core, which will serve as the local DNS server.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo establish a backup connection for Offices B and C in the event of an MPLS failure, a Peplink Balance can be installed in both offices with ADSL lines connected for redundancy. A PepVPN can be set up from Offices B and C to HQ over the MPLS connection, but it is also possible to create a PepVPN from Offices B and C to Office A, which would then route traffic to HQ via the existing PepVPN. Additionally, it is feasible to configure the Peplink Balance in Offices B and C to failover to the ADSL lines and utilize a PepVPN when the MPLS connection is down, allowing for continued operation during outages.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Peplink Balance series of routers, such as the Balance 30, offers comprehensive bandwidth monitoring features that allow users to track data usage across all WAN connections, including 3G, 4G, cable, and DSL. Users can view real-time data statistics, including total download and upload amounts, and analyze data spikes through graphical representations. The system provides daily and monthly overviews of data consumption, enabling users to identify specific devices or IP addresses that may be consuming excessive data. Additionally, the routers support seamless failover between connections and allow users to set data usage limits to prevent overage charges, particularly useful in usage-based billing scenarios. Notifications can be configured to alert users when operating on more expensive connections, and quality of service settings can be adjusted to prioritize bandwidth allocation based on individual user needs.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe Peplink Balance 380 has a maximum limit of 50 concurrent OpenVPN connections. When this limit is reached, additional users attempting to connect will be blocked from establishing a VPN session.\n\n## Document_13\n\nWhen configuring a Peplink Balance 580 with two WAN connections, it is important to set the DNS servers correctly for outbound DNS resolution. If a secondary DNS server is used, issues may arise where the DNS queries do not return expected results, potentially due to misconfigurations or external factors such as ISP redirection. In this case, the logs showed an unexpected IP address, indicating a possible issue with hostname resolution or DNS server order. Reversing the DNS server order might help in troubleshooting the issue, and contacting Peplink support for further diagnostics may be necessary.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo optimize the performance of a Peplink Balance 580 when aggregating multiple internet connections, outbound policy settings such as Weighted Balance can be defined to effectively load balance traffic across the 5 WAN connections. This approach can help manage the differing speeds and characteristics of DSL and satellite connections, potentially allowing for more efficient use of available bandwidth.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe user is running a Peplink Balance 580 to aggregate five internet connections: one satellite connection with 10 Mbps upload/download and four Bell DSL lines that combine for 20 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload. The user has observed that disabling the DSL lines sometimes results in better connection speeds than when they are enabled. The user experiences inconsistent performance, noting that they cannot achieve full speeds through the Peplink device, while direct connection to the satellite provides the expected 10 Mbps speeds.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo ensure that SIP traffic is routed through a T1 line with failover to cable lines on a Peplink Balance 580, it is recommended to dedicate a VLAN for the Voice network. The outbound policy should source from the voice network and target trusted host networks, using UDP or TCP protocols. The algorithm should be set to priority for the circuits, avoiding load balancing for voice traffic to prevent issues such as one-way audio or registration problems during calls.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo set up a backup connection for Offices B and C in case the MPLS link to Office A goes down, a Peplink Balance can be installed in both offices with ADSL lines connected for backup. By enabling expert mode under outbound policies and defining the remote ends network under destination using the Priority algorithm, the MPLS link can be set as the top connection priority, while the PepVPN over ADSL lines can be set as the secondary option. This configuration ensures that all traffic is routed through MPLS unless it fails, at which point traffic will automatically switch to the PepVPN connection.\n\n",

This approach can help manage the differing speeds and characteristics of DSL and satellite connections, potentially allowing for more efficient use of available bandwidth.",
      "The user is running a Peplink Balance 580 to aggregate five internet connections: one satellite connection with 10 Mbps upload/download and four Bell DSL lines that combine for 20 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload. The user has observed that disabling the DSL lines sometimes results in better connection speeds than when they are enabled. The user experiences inconsistent performance, noting that they cannot achieve full speeds through the Peplink device, while direct connection to the satellite provides the expected 10 Mbps speeds.",
      "To ensure that SIP traffic is routed through a T1 line with failover to cable lines on a Peplink Balance 580, it is recommended to dedicate a VLAN for the Voice network. The outbound policy should source from the voice network and target trusted host networks, using UDP or TCP protocols. The algorithm should be set to priority for the circuits, avoiding load balancing for voice traffic to prevent issues such as one-way audio or registration problems during calls.",
      "To set up a backup connection for Offices B and C in case the MPLS link to Office A goes down, a Peplink Balance can be installed in both offices with ADSL lines connected for backup. By enabling expert mode under outbound policies and defining the remote ends network under destination using the Priority algorithm, the MPLS link can be set as the top connection priority, while the PepVPN over ADSL lines can be set as the secondary option. This configuration ensures that all traffic is routed through MPLS unless it fails, at which point traffic will automatically switch to the PepVPN connection."

    "query": "How should a technician optimize a Peplink Balance 580 setup that aggregates both DSL and satellite WAN connections to maximize speed and reliability, and what outbound policy changes are recommended based on the observed issues with performance when both types of links are enabled?",
    "answer": "To optimize a Peplink Balance 580 aggregating both DSL and satellite WAN connections, the technician should avoid aggregating satellite and DSL connections together in the same load-balanced pool, as the high latency of satellite links (around 800ms) can negatively impact overall speed and degrade performance, particularly for SpeedFusion VPN tunnels. Instead, satellite connections should be combined only with other satellite links, while DSL and landline connections can be grouped with cellular connections for better results. Outbound policy settings, such as Weighted Balance, can be used to distribute traffic more effectively across the five WAN connections, but satellite links should be set as backup rather than primary, due to their latency. This approach prevents the satellite connection from slowing down the entire network, which matches observed user experiences where disabling DSL lines sometimes resulted in better performance. Additionally, since browser-based speed tests may not accurately reflect aggregate throughput when multiple links are involved, the technician should use more appropriate testing methods to evaluate performance.",

If the wireless connection is enabled but the SSID is not visible, it is important to confirm the specific model of the Balance 30 being used.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe Peplink Balance 300 has a listed capacity of 20 domains, with additional limitations on DNS records per domain, including 5 NS records, 5 MX records, 30 CNAME records, and 30 IP addresses for A records. Users have reported issues with the device not retaining more than 71 domain names after a power cycle, indicating that the device may not handle more than its specified capacity. The device is also noted to have not received firmware updates since 2009, leading to unresolved bugs, including the lack of SMTP authentication for SMTP forwarding, which is critical for modern ISPs.\n\n## Document_6\n\nWhen using a Peplink Balance 30 Pro with a Verizon SIM to serve a network of over 100 computers, issues with throughput may arise despite good ping times and download speeds when only a few devices are connected. Potential causes for the low throughput could include the limitations of the Verizon plan being used, as many mobile data plans are not designed for enterprise router use. It is advisable to check traffic statistics to identify if any single device is consuming excessive bandwidth and to conduct tests with fewer devices to isolate the issue.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe Balance 300 router supports a maximum throughput of 20mbps per user, despite having three WAN connections each capable of 100mbps. This means that while the total potential speed from the WAN connections is 300mbps, the router's limitations restrict the actual usable speed to 20mbps per user, indicating that the additional bandwidth from the WAN connections is not utilized effectively.\n\n## Document_8\n\nFor the Balance 210 HW4 firmware version 8.0, the sha256 checksum value for the downloaded firmware is b2cace99b7784a5a01c9817907a8c9bffa76607417607d1a4372bc08953a1c40.

It is recommended to untick the SIM A and SpeedFusion connect checkboxes to focus on testing the specific SIM being used, as it may take time to test all SIMs for connectivity.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe Pepwave MAX BR1 Pro 5G is equipped with a single modem that can accommodate two SIM cards; however, only one SIM card can be active at any given time, meaning simultaneous connections from both LTE providers are not possible.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe Pepwave MAX BR1 Pro 5G has a single modem, which means it can only use one SIM card at a time for cellular connectivity. Although it can accept a second SIM card, it functions as a fallback option rather than allowing simultaneous use for bonding. To achieve bonding with multiple connections, users must utilize SpeedFusion technology, either through Peplink's service or by hosting a FusionHub. For those needing a dual-modem 5G solution, the BR2 Pro 5G is recommended, while the Max Transit Pro Duo is a solid alternative for users not requiring 5G.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Pepwave Max BR1 Mk2 is a single modem, dual SIM device that allows users to manually select which SIM card to use or have the router automatically choose based on performance. Users can select options such as 'Both SIMs' or force the use of 'SIM A Only' or 'SIM B Only.' In contrast, devices with multiple modems, like the Transit Duo, allow each modem to be listed as a separate WAN connection, enabling users to drag and drop connections and select SIMs for each modem individually.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe Pepwave MAX BR1 has two SIM card slots but only one cellular modem, meaning it can only use one SIM card at a time, and therefore cannot double speeds. In contrast, devices like the HD2, HD2 Mini, and Transit Duo have two cellular modems and can utilize two SIM cards simultaneously, allowing for potential speed increases by using two SIMs at once.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Pepwave BR1 model can utilize a redundant SIM slot, allowing SIM A to disconnect after 100 GB of data usage and switch to SIM B, effectively providing a basic active/standby setup. However, the BR1 does not support cellular bonding due to its single SIM module configuration. For bonding two SIMs together for increased bandwidth, a model such as the HD2 or any Pepwave device with at least two cellular modules is required. The BR1 can effectively perform Hot Failover when connected to a FusionHub or certain Balance models, but it cannot bond connections.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe Pepwave Max BR1 LTE can accommodate two SIM cards, but only one is actively used at a time. Users can switch between SIM cards either automatically based on signal loss or manually by selecting SIM A or SIM B. The choice of carrier and SIM card mixture depends on whether the modem will be used in a fixed location or in a mobile setting, as different carriers may provide better connectivity in different areas.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe Pepwave MAX-BR1 has a single cellular radio, which means it cannot specify different SIM cards for different user groups. SIM B serves as a backup for SIM A in case of failure or loss of signal.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe BR1 Pro 5G can support multiple WAN connections, including Starlink and a SIM card, allowing for concurrent use of three active WANs without needing the MAX Transit Duo Pro. However, for seamless failover between two SIM cards in a Pepwave device, a dual modem device like the MAX Transit Duo Pro is necessary, as switching between SIM cards in a single modem device results in a connectivity loss during the transition, which takes about 1-2 minutes.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo connect a Pepwave router to Talkmobile (Vodafone), it is necessary to set the APN to custom and use 'talkmobile.co.uk' as the APN, leaving all other fields blank. For a top-tier contract, the APN settings may also need to be customized, and if the SIM works in a phone, the settings from the phone can be referenced for configuration.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Pepwave MAX BR1 Pro 5G does not support the use of two SIM cards simultaneously for different LTE providers. The MAX Adapter 5G is incompatible with the MAX BR1 Pro 5G, as it is designed for devices with a USB WAN port and requires firmware version 8.1.1 or higher for compatible devices. A list of compatible devices for both the MAX Adapter (LTE) and MAX Adapter (5G) is provided, indicating that the MAX BR1 Pro 5G is not included in these lists.\n\n## Document_12\n\nTo troubleshoot a Pepwave MAX router that is not recognizing a newly inserted EE SIM card in the second slot, it is suggested to check the SIM configuration and ensure that the router is set to recognize the new SIM. The router can be configured for redundancy, allowing one SIM to serve as a backup if the primary network fails. Additionally, users can set up automatic switching between two SIMs based on data consumption, which is useful for managing limited data contracts.\n\n## Document_13\n\nTo set up SIM2 or CELLULAR 2 as an additional WAN connection on a Pepwave device, the dashboard allows for drag-and-drop selection of WAN connections. However, the command line interface (CLI) does not support switching between SIM cards; it is limited to configuring the APN. Alternatively, the device API could be utilized to create a custom application for easier management of SIM card selection.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo optimize connectivity using a Pepwave Max BR1 LTE, it is advisable to consider hardware with multiple modems, such as the Balance 20X with a CAT18 module, which can bond multiple WAN connections. This setup allows for simultaneous use of SIM cards from different carriers, enhancing performance and reliability without the need to toggle between them. For T-Mobile users, it is important to ensure that the hardware supports band 71. Additionally, using building-mounted directional antennas can further improve performance.

    "query": "If a technician wants to achieve seamless cellular bonding or failover using two different SIM cards from separate LTE providers in a Pepwave MAX BR1 Pro 5G, what are the device's capabilities and limitations, and what alternative hardware or configurations should be considered?",
    "answer": "The Pepwave MAX BR1 Pro 5G has a single modem with two SIM slots, but only one SIM card can be active at any time. Therefore, it cannot use two SIM cards from different LTE providers simultaneously for bonding. Switching between SIM cards is possible, but there will be a brief connectivity loss (typically 1-2 minutes) during the transition, so seamless failover is not achievable. For actual cellular bonding or truly seamless failover between two SIMs, a device with two modems, such as the MAX Transit Duo, HD2, or BR2 Pro 5G, should be used. Alternatively, bonding can be achieved on devices with multiple modems by leveraging SpeedFusion technology. The MAX BR1 Pro 5G is also incompatible with the MAX Adapter 5G for adding an extra modem.

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nTo direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on a Peplink Balance 20/30 series router, an outbound policy rule can be created. This allows for the configuration of traffic routing, ensuring that certain types of traffic, such as FTP, are directed through a designated WAN connection without round-robin switching between multiple WANs.\n\n## Document_2\n\nTo direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on a Peplink Balance 20/30 series router, navigate to the Network settings and set the Outbound Policy to 'Managed by Custom Rules'. Retain the default rules 'HTTPS Persistence' and 'Default', and then add new rules to enforce traffic from specific LAN clients to designated WANs. After creating the rules, ensure to click 'Save' and then 'Apply Changes' to implement them.\n\n## Document_3\n\nTo direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on the Peplink Balance 20/30 series, it is important to explore the outbound policy settings rather than inbound rules. The outbound policy allows for the configuration of rules that can route traffic from specific devices or applications to designated WAN connections, ensuring that certain traffic, such as FTP, is consistently routed through the intended WAN without round-robin switching between multiple connections.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Balance 20/30 series allows for the configuration of outbound policy rules to direct specific traffic through designated WAN connections. The default outbound policy rule, set to 'Auto', utilizes a weighted balance algorithm based on the downstream bandwidth of each WAN. Users can customize this setting by changing it to 'Custom' to create specific rules for directing traffic, ensuring that certain machines, such as a server for FTP traffic, can be configured to use only a designated WAN connection without round-robin distribution between multiple WANs.\n\n## Document_5\n\nTo optimize WAN performance on a Peplink Balance 20, users should configure outbound policies to manage traffic effectively. Setting the default weighted balance to 1 for both WAN connections can help in balancing TCP connections across the two WANs. This configuration allows for better utilization of available bandwidth from both xDSL and 4G connections.\n\n## Document_6\n\nFor a Balance 2500 router experiencing a constant high frequency beeping sound, it is suggested that a PSU replacement may be necessary if the router is configured with dual PSUs. The status light on the PSU should be checked, with a normal PSU indicated by a green light. Additionally, the beeping sound can be turned off by pressing the red button located on the rear panel of the Balance 2500.\n\n## Document_7\n\nPeplink supports Service Passthroughs, and the 8.1 firmware indicates that SIP Passthrough is always enabled. However, the specific implications of NAT Slipstreaming and whether Peplink devices are vulnerable to this attack are currently being investigated by the engineering team.\n\n## Document_8\n\nTo achieve balanced traffic distribution across two WAN connections on a Peplink Balance 20, the default outbound policy rule, which utilizes the lowest latency algorithm, is generally effective. However, service passthrough support for certain traffic types can override these outbound policy rules and may lead to uneven traffic distribution. Understanding the specific traffic types can assist in configuring the Balance 20 for optimal performance.\n\n## Document_9\n\nFor load balancing between two WAN connections on a Peplink device, the default outbound policy checks for latency. If sessions are not distributed evenly, the weighted balance algorithm can be utilized, allowing for manual configuration with a specific ratio to optimize the distribution of outbound sessions.\n\n## Document_10\n\nIn a Peplink 580 configured in drop-in mode with WAN 1 and an ADSL line on WAN 2, the default outbound policy uses the Lowest Latency algorithm, which may lead to uneven traffic distribution, especially if most traffic is HTTPS and all users are NATTED behind a firewall. This results in traffic being routed through the same WAN until the session ends. For a more balanced distribution of traffic, it is recommended to change the outbound rule algorithm to Weighted Balance.\n\n## Document_11\n\nTo configure a Peplink Balance 20/30 for a network with multiple workstations and servers, the custom outbound policy manager can be utilized to create rules that direct specific workstations to use WAN2 while all other traffic uses WAN1. This can be achieved through the Priority or Enforced algorithm. Additionally, time-based rules for scheduling traffic management have been requested and are on the development roadmap, although no estimated time of arrival (ETA) has been provided.\n\n## Document_12\n\nWhen using a Peplink Balance 20 with two WAN connections, if the combined speed is lower than expected, it may be due to the router defaulting to the slower WAN connection. To optimize performance, users can utilize the custom outbound policy manager to create routing rules, such as weighted balance or priority-based rules, which can help manage how traffic is distributed between the WAN connections.\n\n## Document_13\n\nWhen adding a second WAN connection, such as a fiber 5x5 connection, to a Peplink Balance 20 that is already using a coax cable connection, the outbound policy settings will be crucial. The default Custom rule utilizes the lowest latency algorithm, but users have the flexibility to modify this setting and create custom rules to optimize performance based on their specific needs.\n\n## Document_14\n\nIn firmware v7 for the Pepwave Surf SOHO, the Service Passthrough options can be left unchanged as the device only supports one active WAN connection at a time, utilizing WAN failover. However, if using IPSec VPN in a multi-WAN environment, disabling the Service Passthrough feature may cause issues, but this is not a concern for the Surf SOHO due to its single active WAN configuration.\n\n## Document_15\n\nPeplink routers support SIP ALG (Application Layer Gateway) across their entire product family, and this feature is enabled by default. Disabling SIP ALG can be done by selecting the 'Compatibility Mode' under Network > Service Passthrough Support > SIP in the Balance Web Admin. SIP ALG facilitates firewall traversal for VoIP services by allowing NAT traversal and rewriting information within SIP messages, which helps maintain address bindings until the session terminates.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on the Peplink Balance 20/30 series, outbound policy can be utilized to control which server or type of traffic exits through which link. This ensures that return traffic comes back on the same link it was sent out on, maintaining the integrity of sessions such as FTP. If an FTP session is established on WAN1, Peplink will consistently route that FTP traffic through WAN1.\n\n## Document_17\n\nWhen using a Peplink Balance 20 with two WAN connections, if the Peplink is behind other routers, it can cause double NAT, which negatively impacts performance. This setup may lead to reduced speeds when testing the 4G WAN connection compared to a direct connection to the Huawei router.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe issue of uneven traffic distribution between two WAN connections on a Peplink Balance 20 was identified as being caused by SSL traffic being routed exclusively through one WAN connection. Ensuring that traffic is balanced requires checking the routing settings and ensuring that no specific traffic types are inadvertently directed to a single WAN link.\n\n## Document_19\n\nIn firmware v7 of the Pepwave Surf SOHO, the Service Passthrough options include SIP and H.323, which are relevant for use even though the Surf SOHO only supports one WAN connection at a time and primarily functions with WAN failover. The other Service Passthrough options can be ignored in this context.\n\n",

Additionally, time-based rules for scheduling traffic management have been requested and are on the development roadmap, although no estimated time of arrival (ETA) has been provided.",
      "When using a Peplink Balance 20 with two WAN connections, if the combined speed is lower than expected, it may be due to the router defaulting to the slower WAN connection. To optimize performance, users can utilize the custom outbound policy manager to create routing rules, such as weighted balance or priority-based rules, which can help manage how traffic is distributed between the WAN connections.",
      "When adding a second WAN connection, such as a fiber 5x5 connection, to a Peplink Balance 20 that is already using a coax cable connection, the outbound policy settings will be crucial. The default Custom rule utilizes the lowest latency algorithm, but users have the flexibility to modify this setting and create custom rules to optimize performance based on their specific needs.",
      "In firmware v7 for the Pepwave Surf SOHO, the Service Passthrough options can be left unchanged as the device only supports one active WAN connection at a time, utilizing WAN failover. However, if using IPSec VPN in a multi-WAN environment, disabling the Service Passthrough feature may cause issues, but this is not a concern for the Surf SOHO due to its single active WAN configuration.",
      "Peplink routers support SIP ALG (Application Layer Gateway) across their entire product family, and this feature is enabled by default. Disabling SIP ALG can be done by selecting the 'Compatibility Mode' under Network > Service Passthrough Support > SIP in the Balance Web Admin. SIP ALG facilitates firewall traversal for VoIP services by allowing NAT traversal and rewriting information within SIP messages, which helps maintain address bindings until the session terminates.",
      "To direct specific machines to use specific WAN connections on the Peplink Balance 20/30 series, outbound policy can be utilized to control which server or type of traffic exits through which link. This ensures that return traffic comes back on the same link it was sent out on, maintaining the integrity of sessions such as FTP. If an FTP session is established on WAN1, Peplink will consistently route that FTP traffic through WAN1.",
      "When using a Peplink Balance 20 with two WAN connections, if the Peplink is behind other routers, it can cause double NAT, which negatively impacts performance. This setup may lead to reduced speeds when testing the 4G WAN connection compared to a direct connection to the Huawei router.",
      "The issue of uneven traffic distribution between two WAN connections on a Peplink Balance 20 was identified as being caused by SSL traffic being routed exclusively through one WAN connection. Ensuring that traffic is balanced requires checking the routing settings and ensuring that no specific traffic types are inadvertently directed to a single WAN link.",
      "In firmware v7 of the Pepwave Surf SOHO, the Service Passthrough options include SIP and H.323, which are relevant for use even though the Surf SOHO only supports one WAN connection at a time and primarily functions with WAN failover. The other Service Passthrough options can be ignored in this context."

    "query": "How can a technician configure a Peplink Balance 20/30 router so that specific machines or types of traffic (like FTP) always use a designated WAN connection, while ensuring that other traffic is balanced or prioritized across the available WANs, and what considerations should be kept in mind to avoid common pitfalls such as round-robin distribution or session integrity issues?",
    "answer": "A technician should use the Outbound Policy feature on the Peplink Balance 20/30 series to direct specific machines or traffic types (e.g., FTP) to designated WAN connections. This is achieved by navigating to the Network settings, setting Outbound Policy to 'Managed by Custom Rules', and retaining the default rules 'HTTPS Persistence' and 'Default'. Custom rules can then be added to enforce that certain LAN clients or applications use a specific WAN. For example, an FTP server’s traffic can be directed to always use WAN1, ensuring session integrity and that return traffic uses the same WAN. For general traffic, the default outbound policy can be set to use balancing algorithms like Weighted Balance or Lowest Latency, which distribute other traffic across available WANs. To avoid issues such as round-robin switching (which can break session integrity for applications like FTP or VoIP), it is crucial to use 'Enforced' or 'Priority' algorithms for specific rules and to ensure that session-based traffic is not split across WANs. Changes must be saved and applied to take effect. Service passthroughs and protocol-specific settings (such as SIP Passthrough or ALG) may override outbound policies for certain traffic types, so these settings should be reviewed if experiencing unexpected routing behavior.",

The FusionHub license model allows for one free SpeedFusion/PepVPN peer, with additional peers requiring a purchased license. Deployment involves selecting an EC2 instance type, configuring network settings, and ensuring external connectivity by disabling source/destination checks and enabling IP forwarding. Testing connectivity can be done using built-in tools like PING and PepVPN Analyzer, and troubleshooting may involve checking security rules and VPC route tables.",
      "When deploying Peplink's FusionHub on cloud platforms, users may encounter varying costs and latency based on the chosen provider and data center location. For instance, using Microsoft Azure can incur charges for outbound traffic exceeding the free limit, while proximity to data centers can significantly affect latency. A user experienced low latency (under 10ms) with Azure due to a nearby facility, whereas using Peplink's cloud service resulted in higher latency (around 150ms) due to a distant data center in New York.",
      "To deploy FusionHub on Microsoft Azure, first create a Blob Storage account and a Virtual Network in the Azure Portal. Upload the FusionHub .vhd file to the Azure Storage Container, using Azure PowerShell to manage the upload and VM creation. Define macros for source and destination paths for easier command usage. The command 'Add-AzureRmVhd' is used to copy the VHD file, followed by 'New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment' to create the FusionHub VM. If deployment errors occur, such as 'InvalidTemplateDeployment', it indicates issues with the template validation process.",
      "To set up FusionHub, a virtual SpeedFusion appliance from Peplink, on Microsoft Azure, one must first create an Azure storage account for the FusionHub .vhd image and a virtual network for connectivity. The FusionHub .vhd file can be downloaded from Peplink's website and uploaded to Azure using Azure PowerShell. The necessary commands include defining macros for source and destination paths, and using the Add-AzureRmVhd command to copy the file to Azure. Finally, a virtual machine can be created from the FusionHub VHD using a script that specifies parameters such as resource group name, VM name, OS type, and network settings, allowing access to the FusionHub UI via the public IP address.",
      "FusionHub is a virtual SpeedFusion appliance from Peplink that allows the establishment of SpeedFusion connections between cloud servers and physical Peplink devices, including Microsoft Azure. To configure FusionHub in Azure, users must create an Azure storage account for the FusionHub .vhd image, create a virtual network for the FusionHub to connect to existing and new virtual machines, and upload the .vhd file to Azure. Azure PowerShell is required to manage Azure resources, including uploading the .vhd file and creating a virtual machine from it. Users can define macros for file paths in PowerShell to simplify commands for copying the file and deploying the FusionHub VM.",
      "To route multiple VLANs through PepVPN using FusionHub in a private cloud, first ensure the router in the untagged LAN can route traffic between all VLANs. Then, enable the 'Route PepVPN traffic to LAN' option in the FusionHub LAN settings. Next, enter static route entries in the router, setting FusionHub as the gateway for all SpeedFusion subnets. Finally, configure outbound policy rules in Balance/MAX devices to enforce all VLAN subnets to route through FusionHub."
    ],
    "query": "How does deploying FusionHub on different cloud platforms (such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Digital Ocean) impact setup requirements, licensing, and network performance, and what should technicians consider when routing multiple VLANs through a FusionHub instance in a private cloud?",
    "answer": "Deploying FusionHub on different cloud platforms requires platform-specific setup steps, licensing considerations, and awareness of network performance factors. On AWS, users need knowledge of EC2, VPC, and must disable source/destination checks and enable IP forwarding; they must also consider licensing, as FusionHub allows one free peer and additional peers require a purchased license. Microsoft Azure deployment requires creating a storage account, uploading the .vhd image using PowerShell, and defining network parameters in deployment scripts. Digital Ocean is supported with a specific price point ($5/month for 1TB). Licensing across platforms follows the same model, with options like FusionHub Solo for a free single peer. Network performance is affected by data center proximity, with lower latency achievable by choosing nearby regions, and outbound data charges may apply on platforms like Azure. When routing multiple VLANs through FusionHub in a private cloud, technicians must ensure the local router can route between VLANs, enable 'Route PepVPN traffic to LAN' on FusionHub, add static routes pointing to FusionHub as the gateway for SpeedFusion subnets, and adjust outbound policies on Peplink devices to enforce VLAN traffic routing through FusionHub.",

Longer cable runs can introduce significant signal loss, and environmental factors such as heat may also impact cellular performance, particularly in non-climate-controlled areas.\n\n## Document_16\n\nFor optimal performance with a MAX HD2 MBX router and Maritime 40G antennas in a marine installation, it is recommended to use LMR-400 ultraflex cable and keep the overall cable length from the modem to the antenna under 20 feet. Longer cable lengths, converters, or breaks in the cable can introduce significant signal loss, potentially up to 1dB or more.

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nWhen experiencing connectivity issues with a Pepwave BR2 using Starlink antennas, one possible solution is to power cycle the Starlink unit if it shows 'Connecting...' without establishing a connection. Additionally, it is recommended to connect the BR2 directly to the Starlink dish rather than using the Starlink router and ethernet dongle, as this may affect connectivity.\n\n## Document_2\n\nFor a client requiring support for 1 Gbps internet and high-speed LTE failover, the Peplink Balance 310X is a suitable option. Additionally, the Balance 310 5G is also recommended, which may provide enhanced capabilities. A datasheet for the Balance 310 5G is available for further review of its characteristics.\n\n## Document_3\n\nPacket loss in a Peplink Balance 5G device can be caused by issues with the WAN connection between SpeedFusion peers, particularly affecting the wired WAN connection while cellular WANs may function properly. To address packet loss, it is recommended to use Dynamic Weighted Bonding, which prevents packets from being sent through unhealthy tunnels, thereby mitigating the impact of packet loss and high latency. Additionally, it is important to ensure that both devices are upgraded to the necessary firmware version to enable this feature.\n\n## Document_4\n\nFor achieving high throughput close to 1.9 Gbps with dual high-speed connections (940/940 Fiber and 1000/20 Cable), the Peplink Balance 310X and Balance 380X are considered suitable options. The Balance 310X may not utilize its LTE capabilities, while the Balance 380X supports multiple WAN connections and is preferred for setups requiring LACP (802.3ad) to allow a single client to consume full bandwidth. The Balance 380X is also noted for its ability to support 3-4 WANs, making it a versatile choice for high-speed internet setups.\n\n## Document_5\n\nFor handling 2x 1Gbit up and down fiber connections, the Peplink Balance 310X can manage the throughput but does not support Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP). The recommended model that supports LACP for achieving full 2Gbit throughput to the switch is the Peplink Balance 380X.\n\n## Document_6\n\nTo connect multiple Pepwave BPL 310x devices to a core switch at sufficient speed, LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) is a common method to achieve more than one gigabit of throughput. However, it is important to note that LACP is not supported on the BPL 310x devices, which may limit the options for achieving higher speeds.\n\n## Document_7\n\nIt is not possible to convert the configuration from a PepLink Balance 310 to a PepLink Balance 210. Additionally, it is important to confirm whether a 3rd WAN activation license has been purchased for the Balance 210 router.\n\n## Document_8\n\nFor users looking to implement port-based VLANs on Pepwave devices such as the 305 and above, this feature is currently a request on the roadmap with no estimated time of arrival. In the interim, users can create an 802.1q VLAN and utilize a configurable switch to achieve similar functionality.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe original Pepwave 710 router is rated for a maximum throughput of 400Mbps, but actual performance can vary based on the number of users and active sessions on the network. Upgrading to a newer model, such as the Pepwave 1350, may provide improved performance and higher throughput capabilities.\n\n## Document_10\n\nIt is not possible to convert a configuration backup file from a Pepwave B710 to upload it to a Pepwave B300.\n\n## Document_11\n\nTo improve performance issues with a Peplink Balancer connected to two ADSL lines, it is recommended to check the MTU size settings found under Network > WAN 1(2) > Physical Interface Settings. Additionally, testing the setup without the Windows Server 2008 firewall may help determine if it is contributing to the problem.\n\n## Document_12\n\nFor a wireless Internet service provider looking to combine multiple connections, the Peplink Balance 380 or 580 models are recommended. The Balance 380 is sufficient for current needs, while the Balance 580 offers additional Ethernet WAN ports for future growth and expansion, accommodating potential upgrades in bandwidth.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 is capable of handling internet speeds up to 100Mbps, making it suitable for home or small office use. It is recommended as a newer model to replace the older Balance Plus unit, which may not support faster internet speeds.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe configuration file from a Pepwave BR1 Max (MAX-BR1-LTE-E-T) cannot be uploaded to a BR1 ENT (MAX-BR1-ENT-LTEA-W-T) due to differences in features; specifically, the BR1 includes Wi-Fi AP/Wi-Fi WAN functionality, which the BR1 ENT does not support. For assistance with device migration, it is recommended to contact a local Peplink partner.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Pepwave 7430 supports Band 28, which is relevant for 700 MHz frequency used in Panama City. However, it has limited to no support for US carriers as it is primarily targeted for the APAC market. A future version of the device will include both US and APAC modules in the same device.\n\n## Document_16\n\nFor a company providing wireless internet services to residential apartment buildings, a Peplink Balance 580 is recommended for the HQ, capable of handling 1.5Gbps throughput and supporting up to 1000 users with 5 WAN and 3 LAN connections. A secondary Balance 580 can be implemented for High Availability. The Balance 380 is suitable for medium-sized buildings, supporting up to 500 users and all SpeedFusion technologies. The AP One AX is recommended for Wi-Fi coverage, while the Balance 20X is ideal for smaller locations, with future upgrade options via the FlexModule Mini slot. Utilizing SpeedFusion Cloud simplifies deployment, and InControl 2 allows for remote network management and monitoring.\n\n## Document_17\n\nWhen troubleshooting a Pepwave BR2 with two Starlink antennas, it is important to check if the antennas are running in bridge mode, as having both in NAT mode could lead to IP address conflicts on the same network. Testing the connectivity by disconnecting the working Starlink antenna to see if the non-connecting one can establish a connection is also recommended. Additionally, using separate switches for each Starlink antenna may be necessary for proper configuration, and switching the antennas to see if the issue persists with the same unit can help identify the problem.\n\n## Document_18\n\nTo address packet loss issues with a Peplink Balance 5G via WAN link, it is recommended to test the device by connecting it directly to an internet connection to demonstrate any faults. If errors are found on the WAN1 port causing packet loss while WAN2 operates without issues, this could indicate a physical fault with the WAN1 port, which may lead to an RMA approval. However, if both WAN ports are functioning correctly, Peplink will not authorize an RMA for a device deemed non-faulty.\n\n## Document_19\n\nIf there is packet loss on a Peplink Balance 5G device caused by a physical hardware fault, an RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) can be obtained. Peplink engineering will validate the issue remotely before approving the RMA through the distributor.\n\n## Document_20\n\nPacket loss on the Peplink Balance 5G may occur when the upload throughput exceeds 30Mbps, particularly with ADSL WAN links, which can exhibit similar behavior when upload capacity is saturated. It is important to conduct tests specifically on the physical WAN port to diagnose the issue accurately.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo achieve over 1Gb/sec for a single client, it is necessary to have 10Gb networking between the router and the client, as LACP (802.3ad) will not allow a single client to consume 2Gbps. LACP is designed to load balance flows across multiple physical links, but the speed of any single flow will be limited to the line rate of individual network ports. For a home setup with a combination of connections, the Balance Two is suggested as a viable option.\n\n## Document_22\n\nFor achieving a minimum throughput of 1.9 Gbps with high-speed connections like 940/940 Fiber and 1000/20 Cable, the Peplink Balance 380X is a suitable option as it has a firewall throughput of 3 Gbps. However, there are concerns regarding the lack of clarity on IPv6 support from Peplink, which has not been addressed for over three years. The Balance 380, on the other hand, only supports a firewall throughput of 1 Gbps, making it unsuitable for the desired specifications.\n\n## Document_23\n\nFor achieving high throughput close to 1.9 Gbps with dual high-speed connections, the Peplink Balance 310X is a suitable option, although its LTE features may go unused. The Balance 380 is another potential choice, but it is more expensive. Additionally, the BR1 PRO 5G features a 2.5 Gbps WAN port, indicating that newer devices may support higher speeds as chipsets evolve.\n\n## Document_24\n\nTo manage devices on a network using VLANs, it is recommended to associate devices with specific VLANs and utilize DHCP reservations. This allows the DHCP server to provide the correct IP address from the configured DHCP pool based on the MAC address of the device. This setup ensures that devices, such as VoIP phones, receive the desired DHCP information and can manipulate traffic accordingly. Without port-based VLAN functionality, all LAN ports act as trunk ports carrying all VLANs, making DHCP reservations essential for proper network segmentation.\n\n## Document_25\n\nIn Panama, 4G LTE operates on Band 28 at 700MHz. It is recommended to confirm with the carrier regarding the specific 3G band or frequency in use.\n\n## Document_26\n\nCurrently, none of the existing Pepwave models support Band 28, which operates at 700 MHz, commonly used for 3G in Panama City. However, updated versions that will support this band are expected to be released in 2-3 months.\n\n",

    "query": "A client needs to achieve at least 1.9 Gbps throughput with dual 1 Gbps fiber/cable connections and is considering the Peplink Balance 310X, Balance 380, or Balance 380X. They also want LACP support to maximize throughput to a core switch, and IPv6 capability. Which model(s) should they select, what are the relevant limitations, and what alternative or future-proof options exist?",
    "answer": "To achieve at least 1.9 Gbps throughput using dual high-speed (1 Gbps) connections, the Peplink Balance 380X is the recommended model, as it supports a firewall throughput of 3 Gbps and provides LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) support, enabling aggregation of multiple links to a core switch. The Balance 310X can handle the throughput requirement but does not support LACP, so it cannot aggregate links for a single client or uplink. The original Balance 380 only has 1 Gbps firewall throughput, making it unsuitable for the 1.9 Gbps requirement. It is important to note, however, that LACP does not allow a single client to exceed the speed of an individual link (e.g., 1 Gbps), as it balances flows, not aggregate bandwidth for a single flow. If a single client needs more than 1 Gbps, 10Gb networking between the router and client is necessary. Regarding IPv6, there is a lack of clarity and concern about Peplink's IPv6 support on the Balance 380X, as this has not been addressed for several years. For future-proofing or higher port speeds, newer models like the BR1 PRO 5G with a 2.5 Gbps WAN port may be considered, though this is not a direct alternative for LACP. In summary, choose the Balance 380X for dual 1 Gbps aggregation and LACP, but be aware of the limitations for single-client throughput and uncertain IPv6 support.",

For testing SpeedFusion bonding, users can utilize SpeedFusion Cloud, but the maximum throughput expected is limited to 100 Mbps due to the SpeedFusion/PepVPN bandwidth limit for the Balance 20X.\n\n## Document_2\n\nTo determine if an upgrade from the Peplink Balance 20 is necessary, users should monitor CPU usage and current bandwidth, as the Balance 20 has a throughput limit of 150Mbps. If CPU usage is frequently near maximum or if bandwidth often maxes out, an upgrade may be warranted. For optimal network management, especially with different user groups, implementing VLANs is recommended, as the mesh system in use should support VLANs. Peplink devices do not support mesh networking directly but can utilize a device connector for WiFi extension, which also supports VLANs.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe throughput speed of the Peplink Balance 20 can be either 100 Mbps or 150 Mbps, which may depend on the specific hardware version or firmware. The R6 model is expected to achieve the higher throughput of 150 Mbps.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, which explains why the user is experiencing lower download speeds despite having a 1Gbps connection from Comcast. The user should refer to the provided guide to understand the difference between port speed and the actual throughput rating of the device.\n\n## Document_5\n\nFor a home network setup with a planned upgrade to 1Gb fiber, the Peplink Balance 20X may not provide the desired performance, as it has limitations such as a USB WAN port that only delivers 150 Mbps and issues with IPv6 that can cause crashes under high throughput. Users have reported achieving a maximum of 700 Mbps with IPv4 only, which may not be sufficient for a 1Gb connection. An upgrade to the Peplink Balance Two is recommended for better functionality and performance, along with the use of rugged switches for enhanced reliability.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a throughput of 150Mbps, which is less than the combined total of the user's WAN connections (100/5M, 150/6M, and 35/5M). For users with 20-30 connections, particularly for applications like Zoom, upgrading to a Peplink Balance 305 is recommended due to its higher capacity and performance, supporting up to 1Gbps throughput. Alternatively, the Balance 210 with an additional license can provide a maximum throughput of 350Mbps, but it is not as capable as the Balance 305.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 is designed for small office or branch environments and is recommended for up to 60 users. In larger network environments, using a Balance router with a higher capacity is advisable to prevent interruptions. The Balance 20 may struggle with handling traffic loads effectively, especially when multiple clients are connected and NATed by another router.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a throughput rating of 150Mbps, which may become a bottleneck given the total WAN bandwidth of 350/250 Mbps. It excels in load balancing in multi-WAN environments and is recommended to use PepVPN/SpeedFusion instead of IPsec for better performance. For redundancy, it is suggested to use the Balance 20 primarily for NAT, as it may not handle the full bandwidth effectively. A configuration option includes using the cable modem on WAN 1 in drop-in mode and connecting the fiber to WAN 2, allowing the Balance to act as an ARP proxy for failover. This setup would provide public IP access from the cable modem while maintaining backup capabilities with the fiber connection.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 router has a maximum rated throughput of 100 Mbps, which is likely causing the observed throughput limitation when connected to a 250 Mbps cable connection. For higher throughput needs, upgrading to a Peplink Balance One, which supports over 600 Mbps, is recommended.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a bandwidth limit of 100 Mbps, which may be a concern if WAN speeds increase significantly in the future. The device supports PePVPN in the new 6.1 firmware, providing session persistence but lacking WAN aggregation features found in SpeedFusion. The Balance 20 does not offer user or group bandwidth limitations, which may be a drawback for users needing to allocate minimum bandwidth to specific devices. Additionally, the Balance 20 can handle two WAN connections, one with two static IP addresses and another with a dynamic IP, ensuring proper routing to separate LAN devices.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 allows for the combination of multiple WAN connections to enhance network performance, providing significant improvements in download and upload speeds. However, the ability to set individual bandwidth limits for users via IP or MAC address is not available on the Balance 20, as this feature is reserved for higher-end Enterprise class models. The user has updated to the latest firmware version 5.4.9 build 1732.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a router throughput rating of 100 Mbps, which is a limiting factor for the maximum speed experienced when connected through the device. The Balance 20 features 4 Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) LAN ports, but the overall throughput is determined by the router's specifications. Users should consider the total throughput by adding the upload and download speeds of all WAN connections to understand performance limitations.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 device has a maximum throughput rating of 20Mbps, which may limit speeds when connected to a higher-speed internet service. The newer model of the Balance 20, which features a metal enclosure, is rated for up to 100Mbps throughput, indicating that upgrading to this newer model could resolve speed limitations experienced with the older version.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 is capable of handling internet speeds up to 100Mbps, making it suitable for home or small office use. It is recommended as a newer model to replace the older Balance Plus unit, which may not support faster internet speeds.\n\n## Document_15\n\nFor configuring a Peplink Balance 20 with eero Pros, it is suggested to use double NAT to retain eero functionality such as parental controls, while setting the eero WAN to DHCP for IP assignment from the Balance 20. This configuration allows for enhanced security features from the Peplink device, including content blocking and VLAN support, although eero does not support VLANs. The Balance 20's throughput of 150 Mbps is generally sufficient for 20-30 users, with typical Zoom calls consuming 2-4 Mbps each, but attention should be paid to upload bandwidth. For higher throughput needs, the Balance 20X offers 900 Mbps but has only one WAN port, while the Balance One or Balance Two provide multiple WAN ports at a higher price point.\n\n## Document_16\n\nFor configuring a Peplink Balance 20 with eero Pros, users can choose between Double NAT or bridge mode, depending on their preference for utilizing eero features. The Balance 20 has a throughput of 150 Mbps, which may be less than the combined total of multiple WAN connections. For environments with 20-30 users, especially those using bandwidth-intensive applications like Zoom, it may be advisable to consider upgrading to a different Peplink model to accommodate higher throughput needs.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe throughput speed of the Peplink Balance 20 is dependent on the hardware revision and the firmware version. The current model supports a throughput of 150 Mbps when on the latest firmware.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a throughput speed that can vary between 100 Mbps and 150 Mbps, which may depend on factors such as firmware or hardware configurations. To verify the actual throughput speed, it is recommended to test the connection directly to the WAN using a PC, rather than through a gigabit rated switch.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20X is recommended for a home network with a 1Gbps WAN connection, supporting multiple wired users and high bandwidth activities like streaming and video conferencing. While the Balance 20X may not reach the full 1Gbps throughput, it can achieve around 900Mbps based on user experience. For those needing the full 1Gbps, the Balance Two is suggested as an upgrade, although the additional cost may not be justified for all users. The Balance 20X also offers PrimeCare support, which includes an extended warranty and additional management features through InControl2, making it suitable for integrated network management with other Peplink devices.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20X is suitable for a home setup with multiple devices, providing support for up to 7 SSIDs and 4 VLANs. It allows for Bonjour forwarding, enabling Apple devices to communicate effectively across different VLANs. While the user expresses a desire for a Peplink PoE switch, they opted for a Trendnet PoE switch due to cost considerations. The Balance 20X can handle high bandwidth, and while the user does not utilize SpeedFusion Cloud at home, they have an inControl2 license for remote management and monitoring capabilities.\n\n## Document_21\n\nFor a home network setup with a need for high bandwidth due to multiple users engaging in streaming and video conferencing, the Peplink Balance 20X is a suitable choice, especially for a wired environment with Cat5e connections. It is capable of handling 1Gbps passthrough, although some users have noted a maximum throughput of around 900Mbps. Additionally, integrated solutions like Peplink's rugged switches can simplify network management by reducing the complexity of maintaining VLAN settings across multiple devices.\n\n## Document_22\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20X is being considered for a home network setup that will utilize a 1Gb fiber connection. Users are looking for confirmation on whether the 20X can provide full 1Gb passthrough, as there are mentions of 900MHz in discussions. There are concerns about the feature set of the SOHO MK3 and the 20X, with some users expressing the need for specific features that may not be available in these models. Additionally, Peplink is perceived as more stable compared to other options like the Dream Machine Pro.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 is undersized for applications involving 20-30 users, particularly with high-demand activities like Zoom calls. For improved performance, it is recommended to consider upgrading to a Peplink Balance One, Balance 210 (with the 3rd WAN port activated), or Balance 305. Engaging a Peplink Partner for tailored recommendations based on specific needs is also advised.\n\n## Document_24\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a maximum supported client limit, which may be reached when there are 61 LAN clients connected. If this limit is exceeded, it can lead to unresponsiveness and loss of internet service, causing DHCP clients to auto-negotiate. In such cases, upgrading the hardware may be necessary to accommodate more clients and improve stability.\n\n",

Additionally, if there is a router or firewall in front of the Peplink devices, port forwarding must be configured for the default protocols TCP 32015 and UDP 4500 to ensure proper connectivity.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe conversation discusses a network topology involving a Peplink-360 and Peplink-310 with a Cisco ASA for VPN termination. The HQ Peplink-360 is in VPN passthrough mode with a static IP, while the Branch Peplink-310 uses a PPPoE dialer with a fixed IP. The configuration faces issues due to double NAT and a private IP on the Cisco ASA, which is affecting the peer ID for the VPN connection. The user is exploring aggressive mode for IKE1 on the Peplink-310 and inquiring about the need for similar configuration changes on the Cisco ASA. The conversation suggests that the network design may need reevaluation and mentions the potential use of SpeedFusion VPN for better performance.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Peplink B-380 and B-580 can serve as routers for outside traffic to different ISPs, support load balancing across three ISP links, and utilize SpeedFusion technology for connecting with remote sites. However, while Peplink appliances are primarily SD-WAN devices with reliable firewall capabilities, they may not fully replace the functionality of existing SRX firewalls. It is recommended to conduct thorough testing and refer to technical documentation for deployment guidance.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe Peplink BPL30Lte, with firmware 8, supports OpenVPN features that allow the device to act as a server for client access. However, it does not support peer-to-peer OpenVPN tunnels, which means it cannot function as a dual OpenVPN gateway for connecting two separate locations directly.\n\n## Document_6\n\nTo configure a SpeedFusion tunnel from a Peplink PL380A in Layer 3 mode to a PL580, and a second SpeedFusion tunnel in Layer 2 mode from the PL380A to a PL380B, it is necessary to ensure that the IP addressing is correctly set up. For Layer 2 configurations, both sites should not use the same IP address and gateway; instead, they should have distinct gateway IPs, such as 192.168.50.1 for Site 1 and a different address for Site 2, to avoid conflicts and ensure proper routing.\n\n## Document_7\n\nFor load balancing with different WAN technologies such as DSL, Fiber, and Vsat, with a throughput requirement of more than 2GB, the Peplink BPL-710 or BPL-1350 Max models are suitable options. These models support NAT for all WAN ports and can reroute traffic from a congested or failed link to other WAN links with different NAT configurations. However, specific information regarding failover for WAN links and NAT resolution for users when one of the WAN links goes down is not provided.\n\n## Document_8\n\nAll versions of the Peplink B310 are compatible with the latest firmware, indicating that there are no limitations on firmware upgrades for this model.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe Balance routers BPL-310, BPL-380, and BPL-580 are supported by InControl2, allowing for remote management. To manage these routers remotely, it is necessary to register them in InControl2 and ensure that the WAN connection method is correctly configured using default settings for optimal functionality.\n\n## Document_10\n\nTo enhance WAN capabilities for a branch using a B210, it is recommended to consider a Balance 580 if five WAN connections are needed for internet load balancing. The combination of a B50 with a B210 is not explicitly supported for this purpose, and using multiple devices may complicate the SpeedFusion tunnel setup. There is no mention of a buyback program for upgrading equipment in the provided information.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Peplink BPL 210 and BPL 30 can establish a site-to-site VPN, indicated by a green VPN icon, allowing successful pings between the routers' LAN IPs. However, issues arise when attempting to ping hosts within the respective networks, suggesting potential configuration problems related to LAN subnets, VLANs, or WAN connections.\n\n## Document_12\n\nFor bonding and failover of ISP connections in a data center setup, Peplink devices like the BPL-135 or BPL-2500 can be utilized. The devices can be configured for active/active failover with multiple ISP connections. However, specific license fees for load balancing and bonding should be confirmed with Peplink. It is possible to bond return traffic, but this typically requires Peplink devices at both ends of the connection. To maintain VPN connections during ISP WAN drops, proper configuration of the Peplink devices is essential. Additionally, Peplink devices can function as DNS servers.\n\n## Document_13\n\nTo issue public IPs to clients using a Peplink router, it is important to configure the router to allow the billing gateway to handle 1:1 NAT. If the internet fails on WAN1, the public IPs on the LAN will NAT to the public IPs on WAN2. However, IP forwarding cannot be used on more than one WAN with public IPs. Load balancing and failover can be managed through outbound policy rules in the Peplink Balance router.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo insert firewall rules for SSH in a PePLink 310, navigate to Network, then Access Rules, and select either Inbound Firewall Rules or Outbound Firewall Rules to add a new rule.\n\n## Document_15\n\nTo create a VPN connection between two Peplink units, specifically the BPL 305 and BPL 310, users can refer to the Balance and MediaFast User Manual for Firmware 7, which is available for download on the Peplink website under the Support section.\n\n## Document_16\n\nFor site-to-site VPN configurations involving Peplink devices, using SpeedFusion VPN is recommended over traditional IPSec due to its ability to maintain VPN connections during WAN failures and to aggregate bandwidth from multiple WAN connections. SpeedFusion provides military-grade 256-bit AES encryption for data security and is noted for its ease of setup. The conversation also highlights issues with double NAT and private IP addresses in the context of VPN configurations, particularly with Cisco ASA and Peplink devices.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo establish a site-to-site VPN between a Peplink-360 and Peplink-310 with a Cisco ASA, it is important to address the double NAT issue and the private IP configuration on the ASA. The peer ID on the Branch Peplink-310 should match the WAN IP of the HQ Peplink-360. The Branch Peplink-310 can operate with a PPPoE dialer and a fixed IP, but it is crucial to determine if aggressive mode is necessary for both the Peplink and Cisco ASA configurations. Creating a SpeedFusion VPN profile between the Peplink devices allows for custom outbound rules to manage traffic across the tunnel effectively.\n\n## Document_18\n\nIn a network topology where a Cisco ASA is behind a Peplink-360 configured in VPN passthrough mode, issues arise due to double NAT and the use of a private IP address on the ASA. The peer ID on the Branch Peplink-310 is incorrectly identified as the private IP of the Cisco ASA instead of the WAN IP of the HQ Peplink-360. The Branch Peplink-310 has a PPPoE dialer with a fixed IP, which raises questions about its classification as a static IP and its compatibility with aggressive mode. The configuration attempts included using main mode for IKE1 and switching to aggressive mode, but success has not been achieved. The conversation also raises the need to consider whether the Cisco ASA should be configured in aggressive mode or main mode, and whether any adjustments are necessary on the HQ Peplink-360 in passthrough mode.\n\n## Document_19\n\nIn a network setup involving a Peplink-360 and Cisco ASA, the Peplink-360 is configured in VPN passthrough mode, which allows VPN traffic to pass through to the Cisco ASA. The Cisco ASA has a private IP address on its outside interface, leading to a double NAT situation. The Branch Peplink-310 is using a PPPoE dialer with a fixed IP address. For VPN configuration, the peer ID on the Branch Peplink-310 is incorrectly showing the private IP of the Cisco ASA instead of the WAN IP of the HQ Peplink-360. To resolve this, it is suggested to configure the Cisco ASA to use its private LAN IP as its WAN IP and set the Peplink as its WAN Gateway, avoiding the need to reconfigure remote VPN endpoints. Alternatively, obtaining a new WAN IP range for drop-in mode could be considered, but this would require significant reconfiguration.\n\n## Document_20\n\nAll hardware revisions of the Peplink 310 (B310) are compatible with the current latest firmware. To inquire about purchasing an extended warranty for an out-of-warranty device, one should contact sales with the serial number, hardware version, point of purchase, and a diagnostic file.\n\n## Document_21\n\nUsing a Balance 50 in conjunction with an existing Balance 210 is not advisable as it would represent a downgrade in terms of router throughput, SpeedFusion throughput, and WAN port speed, despite the Balance 50 having more WAN ports. For significant upgrades in performance and capability, it is recommended to consider swapping to a Balance 310 or Balance 580 outright. For information on a buyback program for upgrading equipment, contacting a local Peplink partner is suggested.\n\n## Document_22\n\nTo resolve issues with pinging hosts across a site-to-site VPN between two Peplink devices (BPL 210 and BPL 30), it is necessary to adjust the firewall settings. By default, the firewall may block traffic, so an inbound rule should be added to allow traffic from the LAN (e.g., 192.168.0.0/24) to any destination. This rule needs to be configured on both devices to enable communication between the networks.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe Peplink Balance 1350 and 2500 do not require any license fees for load balancing and bonding, as these features are included. For bonding access to external users, two Balance routers are needed: one at the data center and another at the customer network, with traffic routed through a SpeedFusion tunnel. SpeedFusion provides resilience to internet connection outages, maintaining VPN sessions with zero downtime by routing traffic through healthy tunnels. Additionally, the Balance routers can function as both internal and external DNS servers.\n\n## Document_24\n\nTo configure a Peplink router to issue public IPs to clients, the upstream provider must route a network of public IPs to the Peplink device, which should be set with a public IP address on WAN1 and a /30 subnet mask. The Peplink's LAN must also be in the public IP network, using one of the public IPs for its LAN interface. The DHCP server on the Peplink can then distribute the remaining public IP addresses to the billing gateway. Enabling IP forwarding on WAN1 ensures that public IP addresses from the billing gateway are sent out without NAT, maintaining their original public IPs, while traffic going out through other WANs will be NATed.\n\n",

For VPN configuration, the peer ID on the Branch Peplink-310 is incorrectly showing the private IP of the Cisco ASA instead of the WAN IP of the HQ Peplink-360. To resolve this, it is suggested to configure the Cisco ASA to use its private LAN IP as its WAN IP and set the Peplink as its WAN Gateway, avoiding the need to reconfigure remote VPN endpoints. Alternatively, obtaining a new WAN IP range for drop-in mode could be considered, but this would require significant reconfiguration.",
      "All hardware revisions of the Peplink 310 (B310) are compatible with the current latest firmware. To inquire about purchasing an extended warranty for an out-of-warranty device, one should contact sales with the serial number, hardware version, point of purchase, and a diagnostic file.",
      "Using a Balance 50 in conjunction with an existing Balance 210 is not advisable as it would represent a downgrade in terms of router throughput, SpeedFusion throughput, and WAN port speed, despite the Balance 50 having more WAN ports. For significant upgrades in performance and capability, it is recommended to consider swapping to a Balance 310 or Balance 580 outright. For information on a buyback program for upgrading equipment, contacting a local Peplink partner is suggested.",
      "To resolve issues with pinging hosts across a site-to-site VPN between two Peplink devices (BPL 210 and BPL 30), it is necessary to adjust the firewall settings. By default, the firewall may block traffic, so an inbound rule should be added to allow traffic from the LAN (e.g., 192.168.0.0/24) to any destination. This rule needs to be configured on both devices to enable communication between the networks.",
      "The Peplink Balance 1350 and 2500 do not require any license fees for load balancing and bonding, as these features are included. For bonding access to external users, two Balance routers are needed: one at the data center and another at the customer network, with traffic routed through a SpeedFusion tunnel. SpeedFusion provides resilience to internet connection outages, maintaining VPN sessions with zero downtime by routing traffic through healthy tunnels. Additionally, the Balance routers can function as both internal and external DNS servers.",
      "To configure a Peplink router to issue public IPs to clients, the upstream provider must route a network of public IPs to the Peplink device, which should be set with a public IP address on WAN1 and a /30 subnet mask. The Peplink's LAN must also be in the public IP network, using one of the public IPs for its LAN interface. The DHCP server on the Peplink can then distribute the remaining public IP addresses to the billing gateway. Enabling IP forwarding on WAN1 ensures that public IP addresses from the billing gateway are sent out without NAT, maintaining their original public IPs, while traffic going out through other WANs will be NATed."

    "query": "When configuring a site-to-site VPN between two Peplink Balance routers (e.g., BPL 210 and BPL 30/310), what are the key configuration steps and troubleshooting actions needed to ensure successful LAN-to-LAN communication, especially if the VPN tunnel is established but hosts cannot be pinged across sites?",
    "answer": "To successfully configure a site-to-site VPN between two Peplink Balance routers (such as BPL 210 and BPL 30/310), refer to the Balance and MediaFast User Manual for detailed setup instructions. After establishing the VPN tunnel (indicated by a green VPN icon), ensure both routers' LAN subnets are correctly configured and not overlapping. If you can ping the routers' LAN IPs but not other hosts, check the firewall settings: by default, the firewall may block cross-site traffic. Add inbound firewall rules on both routers to allow traffic from the remote LAN subnet (e.g., 192.168.0.0/24) to any destination. Additionally, verify VLAN and WAN settings to ensure there are no misconfigurations preventing LAN-to-LAN connectivity. If using InControl2 for remote management, confirm that the routers are registered and have their WAN configured with default settings for optimal remote operation.",

The response indicates that previous problems associated with connectivity have been resolved in this update, suggesting that users experiencing similar issues should ensure they are running the latest firmware version.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe firmware version 3.6 does not include the WDS option in the AP tab, as noted in the release notes for that specific version. Users should be aware of this limitation when skipping firmware versions during updates.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe issue with accessing the Peplink iPhone Router utility app after the update to version 2.2.0 is likely related to expired SSL certificates in the firmware, particularly for older hardware versions. Maintenance releases that would include updated certificates have not been issued, leading to connectivity problems for users relying on the Router Utility app.\n\n## Document_5\n\nWhen upgrading from Peplink firmware version 5.1.3 to a later version within the 5.x series, such as 5.3.12 or 5.4.6, an unlock key is not required. Unlock keys are only necessary for major upgrades from firmware 4.x to 5.x. Users should refer to the firmware release notes for additional information before proceeding with the upgrade.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Peplink Router Utility may display a 'Router Unreachable' message and an SSL certificate error if the certificate is invalid or expired. Updating the SSL certificate on the router may not resolve the issue if the Public Root CA certificate from Comodo is outdated. Firmware version 8.0.1 appears to be necessary for proper functionality, as one router updated to this firmware shows correctly in the app. Users may need to consider replacing their own certificates while also ensuring that the Public Root CA is updated.\n\n## Document_7\n\nTo resolve the issue of routers showing as unreachable in the Peplink Router Utility, it is important to check the SSL certificates. The Root Public CA Certificate may still be valid while the local certificate could be expired. Updating the local certificate can restore access to the router. Additionally, using Compatibility Mode on the iOS router utility can help in accessing the routers correctly, especially after firmware updates.\n\n## Document_8\n\nWhen configuring Port Forwarding in Peplink Balance 20 Firmware Version 6.3.1 build 3138, issues may arise if there are non-default firewall rules in place that could interfere with the port forwarding settings. It is important to check for any custom firewall configurations that might affect the functionality of port forwarding.\n\n## Document_9\n\nRandom system startups on Pepwave devices such as the Surf Soho, Balance 20, and Balance One may occur after upgrading to firmware version 6.2.1, as reported by users. The issue does not appear to affect models like the 305 and 380, which are running the same firmware. There is no indication in the logs to suggest a specific cause, as the logs only show a generic 'System: Started up' message.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe most recent API documentation available for Peplink devices is for firmware version 8.3.0, and there is currently no documentation released for version 8.4.0.\n\n## Document_11\n\nTo test Remote SIM functionality on a Pepwave device, it is suggested to use a special firmware version, specifically build 7.1.1s156, as the Remote SIM settings are not available in firmware versions 8 and 7.1.2.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe USSD feature on the Pepwave Max BR1 was broken in firmware version 6.3.3 build 2252, as USSD codes enclosed in hashtags (like #123#) return an 'invalid USSD code' error, while they function correctly in firmware version 6.3.1 build 2023. Users are advised to revert to version 6.3.1 for proper functionality until the issue is resolved. There is no confirmation regarding the functionality of hashtag symbols in USSD codes with version 7 firmware, and users should be cautious about upgrading without this information.\n\n## Document_13\n\nWhen encountering an issue with the iOS app showing 'Router unreachable' due to an expired SSL certificate, one potential solution is to upload a new certificate manually. Some devices may be stuck on firmware version 8.3.0, and Peplink has indicated that they will only update firmware for security issues, not for certificate updates, which can lead to connectivity problems with the Router Utility app.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe firmware update check feature on the device may have a delay in reporting the latest available firmware version. Users can manually download the latest firmware version 3.5.4 from the provided URL to update their access points.\n\n## Document_15\n\nFirmware version 6.3.1 is expected to contain a fix for connectivity issues experienced with certain devices on the LAN side of the Pepwave Surf SOHO router after upgrading to firmware 6.3.0, which caused two of the three devices to lose connectivity and not appear on the Status Client List.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo update the firmware on a Max BR1 Mini, access the web GUI by entering the device's IP address (192.168.50.1) and logging in with the default username and password (admin/admin). Check the current firmware version under the status tab; if it is 7.1.1, you must first upgrade to 7.1.2 before proceeding to 8.0. Download the necessary firmware files from the Peplink support site, ensuring to check the firmware archive for intermediate versions. Perform the upgrade by dragging the firmware file into the manual upgrade section of the web GUI. The upgrade process takes up to six minutes, indicated by the status light changing from red to green. After upgrading to 7.1.2, repeat the process to upgrade to 8.0, confirming the successful upgrade by checking the status page again. These steps apply to any Peplink or Pepwave device.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo troubleshoot connectivity issues with the Peplink Balance 20X when using cable internet, it is suggested to consider the network setup, particularly whether the ISP provides a router. In such cases, the ISP's router should be treated as the first router, with the Peplink acting as the second router. This configuration can enhance security by preventing the ISP from accessing detailed network information. The Peplink Balance 20X offers a good level of security out of the box, and additional security layers can be implemented through VLANs and access rules, depending on the complexity of the network environment.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Balance 20X may experience connectivity issues with certain cable modems, which is a known problem that has not yet been resolved. For initial setup and security configuration, instructions for the Surf SOHO can also be applied to the Balance 20X, as the user interface is mostly similar. Additionally, using a Peplink product is generally more secure than using a standard ISP router or devices like Synology NAS, which prioritize sharing over security.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe Balance 20X may experience connectivity issues with cable internet, potentially due to problems with the ISP, as indicated by packet capture analysis. In a similar case, a user faced connection issues with a Protectli FW4B and resolved the problem by introducing an Asus router between the devices, suggesting that using an additional router may help in troubleshooting connectivity problems with cable modems.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThere is a known bug related to connectivity issues with the Peplink Balance 20X that has been previously documented in a forum thread. Troubleshooting efforts may be necessary to resolve the connectivity problems, particularly when using cable internet with Comcast. The specific details of the bug and potential solutions can be found in the referenced thread.\n\n## Document_21\n\nTo resolve connectivity issues with the Peplink Balance 20X, it is recommended to follow a specific power cycling protocol: unplug all devices including the modem and router for 20 minutes, then plug in the Balance 20X first and allow it to sit for five minutes before connecting the modem and Cat cable. After this procedure, the device should establish a stable connection. The user reported successful connectivity after applying firmware version 8.1.3 and noted that the connection remained stable for two days without interruption, except when intentionally disconnected.\n\n## Document_22\n\nIn firmware version 3.6.0, the WDS (Wireless Distribution System) option is not supported. It is recommended to update to firmware version 3.6.1 to access this feature.\n\n## Document_23\n\nTo access the WDS option in the AP tab, users may need to download firmware version 3.5.4 from the Peplink support downloads archive, ensuring that the firmware matches the hardware revision of their access point.\n\n## Document_24\n\nIn firmware version 3.6 of Pepwave AP products, the WDS (Wireless Distribution System) option has been eliminated from the web interface, which has caused issues for users relying on this feature for connectivity in situations without Ethernet cabling. Users have expressed concerns about the lack of communication regarding this change, as the documentation still references the WDS feature, and they advocate for better transparency in release notes regarding feature changes in future firmware updates.\n\n## Document_25\n\nThe Peplink Router Utility may show a 'Router Unreachable' message and indicate an invalid or expired SSL certificate if the router is running an outdated firmware version. The firmware 8.0.0 included a Comodo certificate that was valid until mid-November 2019, while firmware 8.0.1 introduced a new default certificate that is valid for a longer duration. Updating to firmware 8.0.1 may resolve issues related to SSL certificate validity.\n\n## Document_26\n\nThe issue of receiving an 'SSL certificate is invalid or expired' message when accessing Peplink routers indicates that the SSL certificate has expired. To resolve this issue, upgrading the firmware is suggested as a potential solution to update the certificate and restore access to the routers.\n\n## Document_27\n\nTo resolve the 'Router Unreachable' message and SSL certificate errors in the Peplink Router Utility, enabling 'Compatibility Mode' in the app settings on an iPhone can be effective. This issue was encountered with the latest Router Utility App (v2.2.0) and firmware (v8.2.1) for the SURF SOHO MK2, while older versions of the app and firmware did not present these problems.\n\n## Document_28\n\nRandom system startups on Peplink devices such as the Surf Soho, Balance 20, and Balance One may occur even when factors like bad UPS, power surges, power outages, InControl2 management being off, correct time settings, and non-beta firmware are accounted for. Instances have been reported where multiple Balance One units restarted without heavy load, suggesting that CPU overload is not the cause. These devices were running the latest firmware versions 6.2.0 or 6.2.1 and had been operational for extended periods before the restarts.\n\n",

      "The issue of receiving an 'SSL certificate is invalid or expired' message when accessing Peplink routers indicates that the SSL certificate has expired. To resolve this issue, upgrading the firmware is suggested as a potential solution to update the certificate and restore access to the routers.",
      "To resolve the 'Router Unreachable' message and SSL certificate errors in the Peplink Router Utility, enabling 'Compatibility Mode' in the app settings on an iPhone can be effective. This issue was encountered with the latest Router Utility App (v2.2.0) and firmware (v8.2.1) for the SURF SOHO MK2, while older versions of the app and firmware did not present these problems.",
      "Random system startups on Peplink devices such as the Surf Soho, Balance 20, and Balance One may occur even when factors like bad UPS, power surges, power outages, InControl2 management being off, correct time settings, and non-beta firmware are accounted for. Instances have been reported where multiple Balance One units restarted without heavy load, suggesting that CPU overload is not the cause. These devices were running the latest firmware versions 6.2.0 or 6.2.1 and had been operational for extended periods before the restarts."

    "query": "How do firmware version and SSL certificate updates interact to resolve 'Router Unreachable' and SSL errors in the Peplink Router Utility App, and what additional steps or limitations should a technician consider if problems persist after updating firmware?",
    "answer": "To resolve 'Router Unreachable' and SSL certificate errors in the Peplink Router Utility App, updating the router firmware is a primary step because new firmware versions include updated SSL certificates with longer validity. For example, firmware 8.0.0 included a Comodo certificate valid until mid-November 2019, and firmware 8.0.1 introduced a new default certificate with extended validity. If the certificate is expired or invalid, upgrading to at least firmware 8.0.1 typically restores Router Utility app access. However, if issues persist after a firmware update, technicians should consider manually uploading a new local certificate, as the Public Root CA certificate (e.g., from Comodo) may also need updating, and not all issues are resolved solely by firmware changes. Some older devices no longer receive maintenance releases for certificate updates, so Peplink may not issue firmware updates solely for SSL certificate problems, requiring manual intervention. Additionally, enabling 'Compatibility Mode' in the Router Utility App settings can help restore app connectivity with some firmware and app version combinations. Technicians should also be aware that some devices may be stuck on specific firmware versions, limiting their ability to receive automatic certificate updates.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nThe throughput speed of the Peplink Balance 20 is dependent on the hardware revision and the firmware version. The current model supports a throughput of 150 Mbps when on the latest firmware.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe throughput speed of the Peplink Balance 20 can be either 100 Mbps or 150 Mbps, which may depend on the specific hardware version or firmware. The R6 model is expected to achieve the higher throughput of 150 Mbps.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe older Peplink Balance 20 model has a hardware revision that limits its throughput to 100 Mbps, which explains the reduced download speeds observed when the router is connected. In contrast, newer hardware revisions of the Balance 20 can support speeds up to 150 Mbps. Therefore, the performance drop when using the router is likely due to its hardware limitations rather than a configuration issue.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 is suitable for small business use with up to 25 users, but the recommended user count is a guideline rather than a strict limit. Important factors to monitor include the throughput rating, which should be compared to the actual traffic load, and potential performance issues such as slow speeds or high CPU load if the device is stressed. The Balance 20 supports two WAN connections and has a throughput of 100Mbps, which is adequate given the current upstream speeds of 10Mbps and 25Mbps. Features like SpeedFusion and VPN are not required for this setup, and the user is not segmenting traffic or using advanced QoS settings.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 and 30 routers are rated for 100 Mbps of throughput, which includes both upload and download speeds. They support various types of WAN connections, including Ethernet and USB, although some USB connections may require a firmware update. The Balance series is designed to handle multiple WAN connections, ensuring seamless failover in case one connection drops.\n\n## Document_6\n\nIf experiencing lower throughput than expected from a cable modem service, it may be due to using an older version of the Peplink Balance 20, which is rated for a maximum throughput of 20 Mbps. Upgrading to a newer version of the Balance 20, which can handle up to 100 Mbps, is recommended to achieve higher speeds.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe Balance 20 router has a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, which can be exceeded by a 500Mbps WAN connection, potentially leading to performance issues such as high CPU usage and unresponsiveness during large downloads. Users have reported that actual throughput under real-world conditions can be significantly lower than the advertised specifications, with some suggesting that actual throughput may be about one-third of the raw throughput under ideal conditions. In contrast, other Peplink devices, like the Balance 20X, can achieve higher throughput, with reports of 900+ Mbps on 1Gbps fiber connections.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe throughput on the Peplink Balance 20 is limited to 150 Mbps, which may restrict the performance when connected to higher-speed WANs like a 200 Mbps cable modem or a 400 Mbps T-Mobile 5G gateway. The Balance 20 allows for traffic management by enabling users to send traffic from a specific device, identified by MAC address, to a designated WAN through its Outbound Policy feature, which is a powerful tool for managing network traffic.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, which means that even with three WAN ports activated, the total throughput cannot exceed this limit. To achieve higher throughput with multiple WAN connections, a Peplink Balance One with an extra WAN license would be necessary.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 router has a maximum rated throughput of 100 Mbps, which is likely causing the observed throughput limitation when connected to a 250 Mbps cable connection. For higher throughput needs, upgrading to a Peplink Balance One, which supports over 600 Mbps, is recommended.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a bandwidth limit of 100 Mbps, which may be a concern if WAN speeds increase significantly in the future. The device supports PePVPN in the new 6.1 firmware, providing session persistence but lacking WAN aggregation features found in SpeedFusion. The Balance 20 does not offer user or group bandwidth limitations, which may be a drawback for users needing to allocate minimum bandwidth to specific devices. Additionally, the Balance 20 can handle two WAN connections, one with two static IP addresses and another with a dynamic IP, ensuring proper routing to separate LAN devices.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a router throughput rating of 100 Mbps, which is a limiting factor for the maximum speed experienced when connected through the device. The Balance 20 features 4 Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) LAN ports, but the overall throughput is determined by the router's specifications. Users should consider the total throughput by adding the upload and download speeds of all WAN connections to understand performance limitations.\n\n## Document_13\n\nTo achieve higher download speeds with a Peplink Balance router, it is recommended to use a Balance 305 or a model rated for higher throughput, as the Balance 20 is rated for a maximum of 200Mbps. This may explain the slower speeds experienced when routing through the Peplink device compared to a direct connection to the ISP's router.\n\n## Document_14\n\nWhen experiencing slower internet speeds through a Peplink router compared to a direct modem connection, it is suggested to test the individual connections to assess their metrics. The Peplink Balance 20 does not support SpeedFusion technology, but it can still perform load balancing between connections. Additionally, updating the firmware to version 5.4.9 may help improve performance.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 is capable of handling internet speeds up to 100Mbps, making it suitable for home or small office use. It is recommended as a newer model to replace the older Balance Plus unit, which may not support faster internet speeds.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20X (B20X) is rated for a maximum throughput of 60Mbps when using SpeedFusion VPN with encryption. The performance may be significantly lower when using OpenVPN, which could explain the clients' inability to achieve speeds over 20Mbps on a 1Gbps fiber connection.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a throughput speed that can vary between 100 Mbps and 150 Mbps, which may depend on factors such as firmware or hardware configurations. To verify the actual throughput speed, it is recommended to test the connection directly to the WAN using a PC, rather than through a gigabit rated switch.\n\n## Document_18\n\nThe Balance 20 and 30 routers have the same technical specifications, with the primary difference being that the Balance 30 includes an additional WAN port. The Balance 210 offers advantages such as support for a greater number of users, a more extensive list of Outbound Load Balancing options (7 options compared to 5 on the 20/30), and increased VPN capabilities not available on the 20 or 30 models. All models support multi-WAN configurations and can accommodate various internet connections including cable, DSL, and 3G/4G.\n\n## Document_19\n\nBoth the Peplink Balance 20 and Balance 30 can be configured for 2 Ethernet connections, while the Balance 30 supports 3 Ethernet connections. Additionally, both models allow for 1 USB 3G/4G connection, which can be set up for backup use through Outbound Policy or WAN status. Users can also implement a bandwidth cap on the USB/Mobile connection to disable it upon reaching a monthly data allowance.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe Balance 20 router has a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, which can be exceeded by a 500Mbps WAN connection. When a large file download occurs, it can consume all of the router's resources, leading to unresponsiveness and high CPU usage, which is expected behavior for this model. The Balance 20 may not handle high traffic volumes gracefully, and it is suggested that a more capable device, such as the Balance 20X, would be better suited for handling multiple simultaneous activities without performance degradation.\n\n## Document_21\n\nThe Balance 20 router may struggle with high bandwidth connections, such as a 500Mb/sec WAN, leading to performance issues like high CPU usage and unresponsiveness during large downloads. To mitigate this, it is recommended to set the Upload Bandwidth setting for the fiber connection to 120 Mbps to throttle the WAN interface. Additionally, implementing group bandwidth limits can help manage download rates on the client side.\n\n## Document_22\n\nThe Balance 20 router may experience performance issues such as unresponsiveness and high CPU usage during large file downloads, potentially due to Bufferbloat. While Peplink has implemented fq_codel for uploads under the Mitigate Bufferbloat setting, it currently does not support downloads, with a fix expected in version 9. Users can enable the 'DSL cable optimization' feature to prioritize certain types of traffic, which may help improve Bufferbloat performance until the download support is available.\n\n## Document_23\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a bandwidth limit of 100 Mbps, which may be a concern if WAN speeds increase significantly beyond current levels. It does not offer user or group bandwidth limitations, which means it cannot allocate minimum bandwidth for specific users or servers. The device can handle two WAN connections, one with two static IP addresses and another as a DHCP device, allowing for proper routing to separate LAN devices. However, the new firmware version 6.1 for Peplink 20 and 30 provides PepVPN but does not support SpeedFusion for bonding connections.\n\n## Document_24\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 device has a maximum throughput rating of 20Mbps, which may limit speeds when connected to a higher-speed internet service. The newer model of the Balance 20, which features a metal enclosure, is rated for up to 100Mbps throughput, indicating that upgrading to this newer model could resolve speed limitations experienced with the older version.\n\n## Document_25\n\nTo troubleshoot slow internet speeds when connected through a Peplink router to a Cisco gigabit switch, it is recommended to ensure that the Peplink device is running firmware version 5.4.9 or higher. If the issue persists, opening a support ticket with Peplink for further assistance is advisable.\n\n## Document_26\n\nTo accurately test the actual capacity of internet connections through a Peplink router, it is recommended to use a speed test that allows multiple streams, as traditional speed test sites like speedtest.net typically only open a single socket for testing, which may not reflect the aggregate throughput.\n\n",

The device can handle two WAN connections, one with two static IP addresses and another as a DHCP device, allowing for proper routing to separate LAN devices. However, the new firmware version 6.1 for Peplink 20 and 30 provides PepVPN but does not support SpeedFusion for bonding connections.",
      "The Peplink Balance 20 device has a maximum throughput rating of 20Mbps, which may limit speeds when connected to a higher-speed internet service. The newer model of the Balance 20, which features a metal enclosure, is rated for up to 100Mbps throughput, indicating that upgrading to this newer model could resolve speed limitations experienced with the older version.",
      "To troubleshoot slow internet speeds when connected through a Peplink router to a Cisco gigabit switch, it is recommended to ensure that the Peplink device is running firmware version 5.4.9 or higher. If the issue persists, opening a support ticket with Peplink for further assistance is advisable.",
      "To accurately test the actual capacity of internet connections through a Peplink router, it is recommended to use a speed test that allows multiple streams, as traditional speed test sites like speedtest.net typically only open a single socket for testing, which may not reflect the aggregate throughput."
    ],
    "query": "How does the throughput limit of the Peplink Balance 20 vary by hardware and firmware version, and what are the practical consequences for users with high-speed WAN connections or multiple WANs?",
    "answer": "The throughput of the Peplink Balance 20 depends on both hardware revision and firmware version. The oldest hardware revision is limited to 20 Mbps, while a newer revision with a metal enclosure supports up to 100 Mbps. The latest hardware revisions (such as R6) and current firmware increase the maximum throughput to 150 Mbps. However, even with multiple WANs, the total combined throughput cannot exceed this hardware limit. Users connecting the Balance 20 to WAN connections faster than the device's throughput limit (for example, 200 Mbps or 500 Mbps) will experience bottlenecking, high CPU usage, and potential unresponsiveness during large downloads. To address this, it may be necessary to upgrade to a higher-capacity router such as the Balance One or 20X, or to configure bandwidth throttling and use multi-stream speed tests to accurately assess true performance. Actual observed throughput may be significantly lower than the rated maximum under real-world conditions.",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a throughput speed that can vary between 100 Mbps and 150 Mbps, which may depend on factors such as firmware or hardware configurations. To verify the actual throughput speed, it is recommended to test the connection directly to the WAN using a PC, rather than through a gigabit rated switch.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe throughput speed of the Peplink Balance 20 can be either 100 Mbps or 150 Mbps, which may depend on the specific hardware version or firmware. The R6 model is expected to achieve the higher throughput of 150 Mbps.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 and 30 routers are rated for 100 Mbps of throughput, which includes both upload and download speeds. They support various types of WAN connections, including Ethernet and USB, although some USB connections may require a firmware update. The Balance series is designed to handle multiple WAN connections, ensuring seamless failover in case one connection drops.\n\n## Document_4\n\nThe Balance 20 router has a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, which can be exceeded by a 500Mbps WAN connection. When a large file download occurs, it can consume all of the router's resources, leading to unresponsiveness and high CPU usage, which is expected behavior for this model. The Balance 20 may not handle high traffic volumes gracefully, and it is suggested that a more capable device, such as the Balance 20X, would be better suited for handling multiple simultaneous activities without performance degradation.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe Balance 20 router has a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, which can be exceeded by a 500Mbps WAN connection, potentially leading to performance issues such as high CPU usage and unresponsiveness during large downloads. Users have reported that actual throughput under real-world conditions can be significantly lower than the advertised specifications, with some suggesting that actual throughput may be about one-third of the raw throughput under ideal conditions. In contrast, other Peplink devices, like the Balance 20X, can achieve higher throughput, with reports of 900+ Mbps on 1Gbps fiber connections.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Balance 20 is rated for 30MBps of IPSEC VPN throughput, while OpenVPN typically has lower performance due to higher CPU overhead. The performance issue experienced with OpenVPN on the Balance 20 may be expected given these limitations. The Balance 20X's specifications regarding multi-CPU/core capabilities are uncertain, but it is suggested that upgrading may improve performance.\n\n## Document_7\n\nIn a network configuration involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 routers connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is important to ensure that outbound rules are correctly set up for traffic to traverse from the satellite sites to Azure. The Balance 508 needs to properly advertise its routes to the connected 305 devices for successful end-to-end connectivity.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 has a throughput of 150Mbps, which is less than the combined total of the user's WAN connections (100/5M, 150/6M, and 35/5M). For users with 20-30 connections, particularly for applications like Zoom, upgrading to a Peplink Balance 305 is recommended due to its higher capacity and performance, supporting up to 1Gbps throughput. Alternatively, the Balance 210 with an additional license can provide a maximum throughput of 350Mbps, but it is not as capable as the Balance 305.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe Balance 20 router is rated for a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, but its VPN throughput with encryption is limited to 30Mbps. In contrast, the Balance 20x model offers a higher VPN throughput of 60Mbps. However, the Balance 20x does not support firmware version 7, which may be a consideration for users experiencing issues with firmware 8. The Balance One is another alternative that can run firmware 7, but its VPN throughput specifications are not published. Users should consider the bandwidth requirements for their VPN connections, as actual throughput will likely be less than the maximum capacity of the internet connection.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Peplink Balance 300, which is approximately 15 years old, supports a maximum throughput of 20Mbps. Therefore, if clients are experiencing a maximum speed of 15Mbps, this is within the expected performance limits of the device, despite having three WAN connections with a total potential speed of 300Mbps.\n\n## Document_11\n\nThe Balance 20 router has a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, which is insufficient for users with ISPs offering speeds of 600Mbps and plans for 1000Mbps in the near future. Users are inquiring about potential upgrades for the Balance 20 to support higher throughput speeds or the necessity of upgrading to the Balance 305 to accommodate increasing ISP speeds. There is concern regarding the cost-effectiveness of purchasing a new router that may soon become obsolete as ISPs continue to enhance their offerings.\n\n## Document_12\n\nThe throughput displayed on a Balance device indicates the maximum performance capability of the router, which can vary between models. The Balance 20 has a specified throughput of 150Mbps, which may limit speed tests to around that value, while the Balance 30, which is likely a hardware version 3 with LTE capabilities, shows a throughput of 200Mbps but can achieve higher speed test results, such as 467Mbps. This discrepancy may be due to outdated performance information on the manufacturer's website.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe latest firmware for the Peplink Balance 20W is v4.8.1, and this model has been obsoleted. Users are advised to consider refreshing their router for updated features and support.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe Balance 30 LTE has a maximum throughput of 150Mbps, which is a hardware limitation that cannot be exceeded. For users needing higher speeds, upgrading to a Balance One or Balance 305 is recommended, and Peplink support can assist in converting the configuration file to the new model.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20X (B20X) is rated for a maximum throughput of 60Mbps when using SpeedFusion VPN with encryption. The performance may be significantly lower when using OpenVPN, which could explain the clients' inability to achieve speeds over 20Mbps on a 1Gbps fiber connection.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe throughput speed of the Peplink Balance 20 is dependent on the hardware revision and the firmware version. The current model supports a throughput of 150 Mbps when on the latest firmware.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe Balance 20 and 30 routers have the same technical specifications, with the primary difference being that the Balance 30 includes an additional WAN port. The Balance 210 offers advantages such as support for a greater number of users, a more extensive list of Outbound Load Balancing options (7 options compared to 5 on the 20/30), and increased VPN capabilities not available on the 20 or 30 models. All models support multi-WAN configurations and can accommodate various internet connections including cable, DSL, and 3G/4G.\n\n## Document_18\n\nBoth the Peplink Balance 20 and Balance 30 can be configured for 2 Ethernet connections, while the Balance 30 supports 3 Ethernet connections. Additionally, both models allow for 1 USB 3G/4G connection, which can be set up for backup use through Outbound Policy or WAN status. Users can also implement a bandwidth cap on the USB/Mobile connection to disable it upon reaching a monthly data allowance.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe Balance 20 router may struggle with high bandwidth connections, such as a 500Mb/sec WAN, leading to performance issues like high CPU usage and unresponsiveness during large downloads. To mitigate this, it is recommended to set the Upload Bandwidth setting for the fiber connection to 120 Mbps to throttle the WAN interface. Additionally, implementing group bandwidth limits can help manage download rates on the client side.\n\n## Document_20\n\nThe Balance 20 router may experience performance issues such as unresponsiveness and high CPU usage during large file downloads, potentially due to Bufferbloat. While Peplink has implemented fq_codel for uploads under the Mitigate Bufferbloat setting, it currently does not support downloads, with a fix expected in version 9. Users can enable the 'DSL cable optimization' feature to prioritize certain types of traffic, which may help improve Bufferbloat performance until the download support is available.\n\n## Document_21\n\nIn a network configuration involving PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is noted that IP Sec tunnels do not typically advertise their routes through second hops. To enable connectivity from satellite sites to Azure, a static route for the Azure subnet can be added on the satellite devices, pointing to the Balance 508. Additionally, firewall configurations on both the satellite sites and Azure may need to be reviewed to ensure they allow the necessary traffic exchange.\n\n## Document_22\n\nTo enable connectivity from PepLink Balance 305 devices to Azure through a Balance 508, static routes can be configured on the Balance 305 for the Azure subnet, using the Balance 508 as the gateway. Additionally, the Azure configuration should include a static route for the Balance 305 subnet, also using the Balance 508 as the gateway. It is important to ensure that firewall rules on both ends permit this routing to function correctly.\n\n## Document_23\n\nIn a network setup involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via a star topology, issues may arise with route advertisement to Azure through IP Sec VPN tunnels. The Balance 508 may not be advertising its routes to the connected Balance 305 devices, which can prevent satellite sites from accessing Azure. Additionally, static routes may need to connect to gateways within the same subnet, which can complicate configurations if sites are not willing to share a common subnet.\n\n## Document_24\n\nThe outbound policy configuration on the PepLink Balance 508 was successfully adjusted, allowing the connected Balance 305 devices to traverse to Azure through the established IP Sec VPN tunnels. This indicates that proper routing and policy settings are essential for enabling connectivity between satellite sites and Azure.\n\n## Document_25\n\nThe Peplink Balance 20 is undersized for applications involving 20-30 users, particularly with high-demand activities like Zoom calls. For improved performance, it is recommended to consider upgrading to a Peplink Balance One, Balance 210 (with the 3rd WAN port activated), or Balance 305. Engaging a Peplink Partner for tailored recommendations based on specific needs is also advised.\n\n## Document_26\n\nWhen using PepVPN to link two Balance 20 routers, if some computers are not visible in the other building, it may not be a Peplink issue but rather related to Windows networking challenges. It is suggested to use IP addresses instead of names for easier identification. Additionally, the Balance 20 may experience performance issues on firmware version 8, and users have reported high CPU usage and instability. It may be advisable to revert to firmware version 7 if specific features of version 8 are not critical, and the hardware version of the Balance 20 could also impact performance under VPN load.\n\n",

Users can enable the 'DSL cable optimization' feature to prioritize certain types of traffic, which may help improve Bufferbloat performance until the download support is available.",
      "In a network configuration involving PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via IP Sec VPN tunnels to Azure, it is noted that IP Sec tunnels do not typically advertise their routes through second hops. To enable connectivity from satellite sites to Azure, a static route for the Azure subnet can be added on the satellite devices, pointing to the Balance 508. Additionally, firewall configurations on both the satellite sites and Azure may need to be reviewed to ensure they allow the necessary traffic exchange.",
      "To enable connectivity from PepLink Balance 305 devices to Azure through a Balance 508, static routes can be configured on the Balance 305 for the Azure subnet, using the Balance 508 as the gateway. Additionally, the Azure configuration should include a static route for the Balance 305 subnet, also using the Balance 508 as the gateway. It is important to ensure that firewall rules on both ends permit this routing to function correctly.",
      "In a network setup involving multiple PepLink Balance 305 devices connected to a Balance 508 via a star topology, issues may arise with route advertisement to Azure through IP Sec VPN tunnels. The Balance 508 may not be advertising its routes to the connected Balance 305 devices, which can prevent satellite sites from accessing Azure. Additionally, static routes may need to connect to gateways within the same subnet, which can complicate configurations if sites are not willing to share a common subnet.",
      "The outbound policy configuration on the PepLink Balance 508 was successfully adjusted, allowing the connected Balance 305 devices to traverse to Azure through the established IP Sec VPN tunnels. This indicates that proper routing and policy settings are essential for enabling connectivity between satellite sites and Azure.",
      "The Peplink Balance 20 is undersized for applications involving 20-30 users, particularly with high-demand activities like Zoom calls. For improved performance, it is recommended to consider upgrading to a Peplink Balance One, Balance 210 (with the 3rd WAN port activated), or Balance 305. Engaging a Peplink Partner for tailored recommendations based on specific needs is also advised.",
      "When using PepVPN to link two Balance 20 routers, if some computers are not visible in the other building, it may not be a Peplink issue but rather related to Windows networking challenges. It is suggested to use IP addresses instead of names for easier identification. Additionally, the Balance 20 may experience performance issues on firmware version 8, and users have reported high CPU usage and instability. It may be advisable to revert to firmware version 7 if specific features of version 8 are not critical, and the hardware version of the Balance 20 could also impact performance under VPN load."
    ],
    "query": "How do firmware version, hardware revision, and network usage (including VPN and high-bandwidth WAN connections) collectively impact the real-world throughput and performance of the Peplink Balance 20, and what configuration or upgrade strategies can help mitigate performance issues in demanding environments?",
    "answer": "The throughput of the Peplink Balance 20 is influenced by both firmware version and hardware revision, with the latest hardware and firmware supporting up to 150Mbps throughput. However, real-world throughput is often lower, especially when using VPNs: IPSEC VPN is limited to 30Mbps, and OpenVPN yields even lower speeds due to higher CPU overhead. High-bandwidth WAN connections (e.g., 500Mbps) can overwhelm the Balance 20, causing high CPU usage and unresponsiveness during large downloads. To mitigate these issues, recommended strategies include setting bandwidth caps or throttling high-speed WAN interfaces to around 120Mbps, using group bandwidth limits to prevent client overuse, and enabling the 'DSL cable optimization' feature to improve Bufferbloat performance. In cases of persistent CPU saturation and performance bottlenecks, especially with 20–30 users or heavy VPN usage, upgrading to a more powerful model like the Balance 20X, Balance One, Balance 210, or Balance 305 is advised.",

The difference in speed between the internet router and the SOHO is not indicative of a malfunction but rather a result of the router's maximum capacity.\n\n## Document_2\n\nThe Peplink Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput of 120 Mbps, which may limit connection speeds to around 100 Mbps, even if the internet service is upgraded to 200 Mbps. For higher throughput needs, considering a Peplink Balance 20X or other devices that support closer to 200 Mbps is advisable.\n\n## Document_3\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput limit of 120 Mbps, which means it cannot achieve higher speeds regardless of the internet plan. For users needing higher speeds, upgrading to a more powerful unit such as the Balance One, which supports up to 600 Mbps, or the Balance 20X, which supports up to 900 Mbps, is recommended. These speeds are under optimal conditions, and actual speeds may vary based on factors like Wi-Fi signal strength and channel congestion.\n\n## Document_4\n\nTo troubleshoot the issue of not achieving the upgraded 20mbps speed on a router, users should check the WAN Connection settings under Network - WAN, specifically the Bandwidth and Port Speed settings. Additionally, reviewing the Bandwidth Control settings under Advanced - QoS may help identify any limitations affecting the speed.\n\n## Document_5\n\nThe Peplink Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput specification of 120 Mbps, which explains why the speed at the workstation via network cable is lower than the modem test speed of 350 Mbps. Users should refer to Peplink's website for detailed specifications regarding the device's performance limits.\n\n## Document_6\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 has an advertised router throughput of 120 Mbps, which is a slight improvement over earlier generations. The MK3 features upgraded Wi-Fi from N to AC and increased the number of antennas from 2 to 3, providing concurrent dual-band Wi-Fi. For users with higher provisioning rates, considering a Pepwave Balance One may be advisable.\n\n## Document_7\n\nThe current version of the Pepwave Surf SOHO has a maximum router throughput of 120 Mbps, which explains the lower speed test results observed when connected to a fiber optic connection. Users should not expect to achieve gigabit speeds with this device, as its specifications limit the throughput significantly below that level.\n\n## Document_8\n\nThe throughput of a Pepwave Surf SOHO router can be influenced by several factors including the number of configured rules and the use of special features. Peplink tends to be conservative in their bandwidth specifications. WiFi performance can vary significantly due to factors such as frequency band, channel interference, signal strength, channel width, number of streams, and the WiFi generation of both the router and the client device.\n\n## Document_9\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 has a specified throughput capability of 120 Mbps. Users may experience lower speeds when connected through the router compared to a direct connection to the modem, which can be attributed to the router's limitations.\n\n## Document_10\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 may not be able to handle the upgraded internet speed of 400 Mbps, as indicated by the user's experience of only achieving 110 Mbps when connected through the router. Other models, such as the Balance One Core and three additional models, support throughput ranging from 350 to 600 Mbps, which may be more suitable for higher speed internet connections.\n\n## Document_11\n\nWhen using a Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 with an ARRIS SB6141 Cable Modem, users may experience reduced throughput compared to direct modem connections. The Surf SOHO MK3 is confirmed to operate at 1000Base-T mode, but users have reported download speeds between 50-57 Mbps despite having a 160 Mbps service. Testing on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands may yield different performance results, as indicated by a user who experienced 44 Mbps on 2.4 GHz and 62 Mbps on 5 GHz with a similar setup.\n\n## Document_12\n\nWhen using a Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 with an ARRIS SB6141 Cable Modem, users may experience reduced throughput, achieving only 50-57 Mbps compared to direct connections to the modem that yield 160-170 Mbps. The Surf SOHO MK3 is running firmware version 7.1.0 and has been tested with various port speed settings, including 1000Mbps duplex and Auto, but these adjustments did not improve speeds. The router's advertised aggregate throughput is 120 Mbps, which may be a limiting factor in achieving higher speeds through the router.\n\n## Document_13\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 has a rated WAN throughput of 120Mbps, which can lead to reduced speeds based on network traffic and router load. For users requiring higher throughput, the Balance One with WiFi is recommended as a more suitable device for high-speed connections.\n\n## Document_14\n\nThe throughput of the Pepwave SOHO MK 3 router is rated at 120Mbps, which means that regardless of the ISP plan providing 1Gbps, the maximum internet speed available to clients connected to the router will be limited to 120Mbps due to the router's specifications.\n\n## Document_15\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput of 120 Mbps, which is typically measured under optimal lab conditions. Users may experience lower speeds in real-world scenarios, and if a user has upgraded their internet service to 200 Mbps but is only achieving speeds around 100 Mbps, it may be necessary to consider upgrading to a faster router to fully utilize the increased WAN speed.\n\n## Document_16\n\nThe Peplink Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput of around 120 Mbps, which may not be sufficient for high-speed internet plans like 1000 Mbps. Users experiencing buffering issues while streaming may need to consider upgrading to a different router that can handle higher speeds, as the current setup may not be compatible with the desired internet performance.\n\n## Document_17\n\nThe Pepwave Surf SOHO has a maximum throughput of 120 Mbps, which is significantly lower than the gigabit speeds available from fiber optic connections. Users may experience lower speeds on different connection types, such as 190 Mbps on a gigabit Ethernet USB dongle and 45 Mbps on 5GHz WiFi, indicating that the router's limitations are affecting overall performance.\n\n## Document_18\n\nWhen using a Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 with an ARRIS SB6141 Cable Modem, users may experience reduced download speeds compared to direct connections to the modem. The Surf SOHO MK3 is confirmed to operate at 1000Base-T mode, and settings such as port speed and upload/download bandwidth are set to 1 Gbps. Initial CPU usage during boot may affect speed test results, suggesting that waiting for the router to stabilize before testing could yield better performance.\n\n",

    "query": "A customer upgrades their ISP plan to 400 Mbps and connects their Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3 router (latest firmware) between their modem (e.g., ARRIS SB6141) and their devices. Despite confirming that the modem and router port speeds are set to 1 Gbps, speed tests through the router never exceed 110 Mbps, while direct modem connection yields 350+ Mbps. What are all the technical reasons for this observed speed limitation, and what should the technician recommend if the customer wants to utilize the full 400 Mbps speed?",
    "answer": "The primary technical reason the customer is unable to achieve more than 110 Mbps through the Pepwave Surf SOHO MK3, despite having a 400 Mbps ISP plan and 1 Gbps link speeds between modem and router, is the router's maximum rated throughput of 120 Mbps. This is a hard specification limit for the device, and actual real-world speeds are often slightly lower due to processing overhead, Wi-Fi conditions, and network load. Attempts to adjust port speeds or use different settings will not overcome this limit. If the customer wishes to take full advantage of their 400 Mbps internet connection, they must upgrade to a Pepwave or Peplink router model with higher WAN throughput, such as the Balance One Core (rated up to 600 Mbps) or the Balance 20X (rated up to 900 Mbps).",

    "documents_text": "## Document_1\n\nThe version 8 firmware upgrade for Pepwave devices introduced a new section on the AP tab, which includes 'Status' that displays information about Access Points, Wireless SSID, Wireless Clients, Nearby Devices, and Event Logs. A 'Station Probe' refers to any device searching for an Access Point to connect to, while the Access Point (AP) displays other nearby access points available for wireless devices. The feature may help identify rogue access points by comparing names and MAC addresses, although flagging a rogue AP primarily serves for reporting purposes.\n\n## Document_2\n\nA Pepwave Soho can connect to two Pepwave Sohos via VPN.\n\n## Document_3\n\nIn Peplink networking, a port can be configured as either an Access port, where traffic is untagged for a specific VLAN, or as a Trunk port, where traffic is tagged. In Firmware 7.10 and earlier, a Trunk port would present the default LAN (typically the DATA VLAN) as untagged while other VLANs would be tagged. The latest Firmware (v7.1.1) allows users to choose which VLANs are tagged when setting a port to Trunk, providing more flexibility in VLAN management.\n\n## Document_4\n\nIn a network setup involving Peplink routers, configuring a router as an NTP server can lead to the router pushing its NTP settings to connected access points (APs). However, if the APs are configured to follow the router's NTP settings, they will not independently use a different NTP server unless the AP Controller role is removed from the router. The B1 router can serve as an NTP source for the B30 router when both are on the same LAN, allowing for localized time synchronization without relying on external NTP servers. The use of time.google.com is noted as a reliable fallback for time synchronization across devices.\n\n## Document_5\n\nIn a Peplink Balance 20 router, when a port is set to Access type, outbound frames leaving the router on that port are tagged with the defined VLAN (e.g., VLAN=44). For inbound frames, if a frame is tagged with VLAN=44, it is accepted; if it is tagged with a different VLAN, it is dropped; and if it is untagged, it is assigned the VLAN of the Access port. When the port type is set to Trunk, the behavior changes: the Trunk port expects VLAN tags and will drop any untagged frames or frames with VLANs that do not match the trunk configuration. Access ports automatically tag incoming packets, while Trunk ports require existing tags to process packets correctly.\n\n## Document_6\n\nWi-Fi Mesh allows Peplink routers or access points (APs) to wirelessly expand Wi-Fi coverage using additional Peplink APs, providing flexibility in areas where Ethernet cannot be run. Direct wired APs perform better than mesh APs due to shared Wi-Fi frequencies and radios, which can limit capacity based on the wireless link quality. Proper placement of mesh APs is crucial; they should be positioned between the wired AP and the coverage area to ensure strong wireless links. The setup requires a Peplink router or AP with 802.11ac or newer, a second compatible AP for meshing, and firmware that supports these features. Configuration involves creating a mesh profile and enabling it on both the router and APs, with the option to streamline provisioning through the AP Controller feature.\n\n## Document_7\n\nWi-Fi Mesh allows Peplink routers and access points (APs) to wirelessly expand Wi-Fi coverage by connecting multiple APs, enhancing coverage in areas without Ethernet access. Direct wired APs perform better than mesh APs due to shared Wi-Fi frequencies and radios, which can limit capacity based on wireless link quality. Proper placement of mesh APs is crucial; they should ideally be positioned between the wired AP and the coverage area to ensure strong wireless links. The setup requires compatible Peplink devices with the appropriate firmware, and each mesh AP must be powered. The mesh network operates on a Layer 2 connection, supporting VLAN tagged SSIDs, and can be managed via the AP controller for streamlined deployment.\n\n## Document_8\n\nWi-Fi Mesh allows Peplink routers and access points (APs) to wirelessly expand Wi-Fi coverage using additional APs, providing flexibility in coverage areas where Ethernet cannot be run.

Proper placement of mesh APs is crucial; they should be positioned between the wired AP and the coverage area to optimize wireless links. The setup requires a Peplink router or wired AP with 802.11ac or newer, a second AP for wireless meshing, and compatible firmware. Mesh networks function as Layer 2 connections, allowing VLAN tagged SSIDs to operate like on wired networks, but issues may arise with DHCP connections for tagged VLANs in certain configurations.\n\n## Document_9\n\nWi-Fi Mesh allows Peplink and Pepwave routers or access points (APs) to wirelessly expand Wi-Fi coverage using additional APs. Direct wired APs perform better than mesh APs due to shared Wi-Fi frequencies and radios, which can limit capacity. For optimal performance, mesh APs should be placed strategically between the wired AP and the coverage area to reduce signal loss. To set up a mesh network, a Peplink router or wired AP with 802.11ac or newer is required, along with a second AP that also supports 802.11ac or newer. Firmware versions 8.1.1 for routers and 3.6.2/3.7.3/3.8.1 for APs are necessary for mesh support. Configuration involves creating a mesh profile, enabling it, and ensuring all APs share the same Mesh ID and key. The setup can be streamlined using the AP Controller feature for easier provisioning of mesh settings.\n\n## Document_10\n\nWi-Fi Mesh allows Peplink routers and access points (APs) to wirelessly expand Wi-Fi coverage using additional Peplink APs.

Direct wired APs provide better performance than mesh APs, as meshing shares Wi-Fi frequencies and radios, which can limit capacity due to interference and distance. For optimal performance, mesh APs should be placed strategically between the wired AP and the coverage area. To set up a mesh network, a Peplink|Pepwave router or wired AP with 802.11ac or newer is required, along with a second mesh-capable AP. Firmware versions 8.1.1 for routers and 3.6.2/3.7.3/3.8.1 for APs are necessary. The setup involves creating a mesh profile in the router and AP settings, ensuring matching Mesh IDs and keys, and enabling the profiles. APs can auto-detect wired uplinks and join the mesh network accordingly, and VLAN tagged SSIDs will function as they would on a wired network.\n\n## Document_14\n\nTo address the issue of seeing the hotspot `PEPWAVE_XXXX`, one can disable the Access Point feature or rename the Wi-Fi Access Point to a preferred name.\n\n## Document_15\n\nWi-Fi meshing is a technology that allows for the extension of Wi-Fi coverage wirelessly, enabling seamless roaming between access points (APs) without the need for Ethernet cables. While traditional setups involve hardwired connections between APs for optimal performance, meshing provides flexibility in scenarios where running cables is impractical or too costly. Peplink supports both Wi-Fi meshing and roaming, allowing users to configure multiple APs to work together either through wired connections or wirelessly. The setup process for meshing can be done via the Peplink user interface or through InControl for zero-touch configuration. Users must create a wireless mesh network and assign it to a profile to ensure proper functionality. The technology also includes considerations for performance limitations, emphasizing that wired connections are preferable when possible.\n\n## Document_16\n\nTo optimize Starlink connectivity with a Peplink device, users should download the Starlink module from the Peplink dashboard, which enhances speed and traffic management. The setup involves connecting a preconfigured access point to the Peplink device, allowing for improved Wi-Fi coverage in areas with distance issues. The Peplink B15G router can connect to Starlink via the WAN port, resulting in significant speed improvements. Additionally, Peplink's M series data plans offer multicarrier support, allowing users to switch between major US carriers like T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T based on availability, providing a reliable backup when Starlink is not operational. These plans range from low gigabyte options to larger data allowances, catering to various user needs.\n\n## Document_17\n\nTo configure a central NTP server in a network with multiple routers and access points, the NTP clients (such as access points and other routers) should connect to the LAN side of the NTP server. The main router (B1) can be set as the NTP server, which should synchronize its time from an internet source. However, if the access points are configured to follow the NTP settings of the AP controller, they may not be able to use the B1 as their NTP source directly. In this scenario, the B30 router can successfully use B1 as an NTP source since it is on the same LAN, indicating that proper routing and firewall rules must be established for NTP traffic to flow correctly between devices.\n\n## Document_18\n\nTo configure a central NTP server in a network with Peplink routers, the main router (B1) can be set as the NTP server, which should synchronize its time via an internet source. Other devices, such as access points (APs) and a secondary router (B30), should point to the main router for time synchronization. However, issues may arise if the APs are configured to follow the NTP settings of the AP controller, which may default to an external NTP source like time.google.com. The B1 can serve as a time source for the B30 since both are on the same LAN, allowing local traffic to reduce internet dependency for time synchronization.\n\n## Document_19\n\nThe BalanceOne router can function as an NTP server, allowing devices on the network to synchronize their time with it. However, there are limitations in how Access Points (APs) configured under the AP Controller synchronize their NTP settings, as they typically follow the NTP server configuration set in the AP Controller. A future update (version 8.2.0) is expected to allow customization of NTP settings for managed APs, which would enable them to use the BalanceOne router as their NTP source instead of defaulting to an external NTP server like time.google.com.\n\n## Document_20\n\nTo configure a central NTP server in a network with Pepwave routers, the main router (B1) should ideally be set as the NTP server, updating its time via an internet source. However, issues may arise when trying to have other devices, such as APs and a secondary router (B30), use the B1 as their NTP source. The B1 can serve as an NTP source for the B30 when both are on the same LAN, but the APs may default to the NTP server configured in the AP controller, which complicates the setup. Additionally, the frequency of time updates and logging behavior of the Balance One Core router's NTP service may affect the visibility of successful time updates in the event log.\n\n## Document_21\n\nThe Balance One Core router updates its time every half hour and logs failures to contact the NTP server, but does not log successful updates. Users have reported issues with default NTP servers, such as 0.peplink.pool.ntp.org, potentially due to WAN connection issues or DNS resolution failures. It is suggested to ping the NTP server from the router's system settings to diagnose connectivity problems.\n\n## Document_22\n\nWhen configuring NTP servers on a network with multiple Pepwave routers, it is noted that the Access Points (APs) will synchronize their NTP settings based on the configuration of the router acting as the AP controller. The main router (B1) can be set as an NTP server to provide time to other devices on the network, but issues may arise when trying to access the NTP server from another router (B30) connected via WAN. The B1 can successfully provide time to the B30 since they are on the same LAN, but the APs may default to an external NTP source like time.google.com if not properly configured. Time synchronization events are logged and occur every 30 minutes after startup.\n\n",

The B1 can successfully provide time to the B30 since they are on the same LAN, but the APs may default to an external NTP source like time.google.com if not properly configured. Time synchronization events are logged and occur every 30 minutes after startup."

    "query": "How can a technician deploy a Wi-Fi Mesh network with VLAN tagged SSIDs using Peplink or Pepwave devices, and what considerations are there for placement, firmware, AP management, and potential DHCP issues?",
    "answer": "To deploy a Wi-Fi Mesh with VLAN tagged SSIDs using Peplink or Pepwave devices, the technician must use compatible hardware (routers/APs with 802.11ac or newer), ensure all devices run appropriate firmware (routers: 8.1.1+, APs: 3.6.2/3.7.3/3.8.1+), and power all mesh APs. The mesh is configured by creating and enabling a mesh profile on both routers and APs, making sure all APs share the same Mesh ID and key. Mesh networks operate at Layer 2, allowing VLAN tagged SSIDs to function similarly to wired networks. AP Controller can streamline provisioning and management. For optimal performance, mesh APs must be positioned between the wired AP and the coverage area to ensure strong links—direct wired APs always provide better performance due to radio sharing and capacity limits. A potential issue is that DHCP may not function as expected for tagged VLANs in certain mesh setups, so this should be tested during deployment.",

      "To connect a Starlink dish to a Peplink router and manage it via the management app, the dish's IP address (192.168.100.1) needs to be accessible through WAN1. Attempts to configure this include setting outbound policies for all WANs, adding the IP as an additional IP, creating NAT rules, and adjusting firewall settings. However, the IP is only reachable during the initial boot of the dish, indicating it may not respond to pings at other times, complicating the management setup."

    "query": "What are the complete requirements and common issues for configuring a Peplink router to manage a Starlink dish via the management IP 192.168.100.1, including firmware, IP addressing, WAN settings, outbound policies, and known device access limitations?",
    "answer": "To manage a Starlink dish through a Peplink router, you must use special firmware version 8.1.1s118, which enables access to the dish at the management IP 192.168.100.1. The Peplink router's WAN ports should be set to DHCP/NAT mode, and automatic DNS is recommended. The WAN connection method must be DHCP, and you need to assign a management IP address within 192.168.100.2 to 192.168.100.254, saving and applying the changes. For LAN clients to access the dish management app, an outbound policy should be created: source 'Any', destination '192.168.100.1', using the Enforced algorithm to direct traffic to the Starlink WAN. Some Peplink models, such as Balance One, do not support this setup. Access to 192.168.100.1 may be limited, often only possible during the Starlink dish's initial boot, and pinging the address may not work at other times. Web browser compatibility can also affect management access, with some success in Microsoft Edge versus Chrome or Brave. Firmware updates are more reliable when performed over a wired (Ethernet) connection. The Starlink device may restrict admin access to clients within its local subnet, which can further complicate management connectivity.",

    "query": "If an enterprise environment requires 10G fiber uplinks and Power over Ethernet (PoE) on all ports in a rugged switch deployment, which Peplink SD Switch models and SFP+ modules should be considered for maximum compatibility and fewest known issues? How do known hardware limitations and compatibility influence the choice?",
    "answer": "For an enterprise deployment requiring 10G fiber uplinks and PoE on all ports in a rugged switch environment, the Peplink SD Switch 24-Port Rugged and higher (such as the 48-Port) models should be prioritized. The SD Switch 24-Port Rugged is specifically recommended because it has improved grounding (more separated GND_POE), which addresses known hardware incompatibilities with Intel Ethernet NICs equipped with ASUS LANGuard—a problem present in the 8-Port and 16-Port Rugged models. For SFP+ module selection, thoroughly tested and compatible models include Avago's AFBR-700SDZ and AFBR-703SDZ-IN2, Finisar's FTLX8571D3BCL and FTLX8571D3QCV-IT, and Intel's AFBR-703SDZ-IN2, with FS SFP 10G-T adapters also validated for use in 24/48-port SD switches. Rugged switch models should be chosen that support PoE on all ports as recommended for such environments. The 8-Port and 16-Port Rugged models are cost-effective and rugged but have PoE hardware compatibility issues with certain Intel NICs, making the 24-Port Rugged a more reliable option for critical deployments requiring broad compatibility and performance.",

    "query": "How does Peplink SpeedFusion technology differ from traditional VPN and bonding solutions in terms of requirements, supported connection types, failover, and security, and what are key deployment options for different user types?",
    "answer": "Peplink SpeedFusion technology differs from traditional VPN and bonding solutions in several ways. Unlike IPsec VPN or LACP bonding, which often require identical circuits or are sensitive to latency and packet loss, SpeedFusion can bond any mix of internet connections (e.g., fiber, DSL, 4G, 5G, satellite, Wi-Fi) from different providers. It aggregates bandwidth at the packet level, providing combined throughput and seamless failover without session drops. SpeedFusion requires compatible Peplink devices or FusionHub endpoints at both ends to bond connections, supporting topologies such as point-to-point, hub-and-spoke, or full mesh. Security is enhanced through unique encryption keys for each WAN, offering better protection than traditional VPNs. For deployment, enterprise users typically use hardware appliances at headquarters, while home users can leverage Peplink's hosted services or run FusionHub as a virtual endpoint for cost-effectiveness. Centralized management is available through the InControl platform, simplifying large-scale deployments.",

The NAT Mapping interface allows selection of specific external IPs for both inbound and outbound connections, enabling one-to-one NAT mappings. The technician should go to the network settings, access Outbound Mappings, and create a new mapping specifying the local IP and the intended public IP.

      "The firmware update from 8.0.2 to 8.1.0 on the SOHO MK3 is not reflecting correctly after reboot, as it still shows firmware version 8.0.2. This issue has not been reported on the B30 model, indicating a potential problem specific to the SOHO MK3 firmware update process.",
      "After updating the firmware on a Pepwave SOHO MK3 from version 8.0.2 to 8.1.0, the device still displays the previous firmware version after rebooting. However, the new firmware version 8.1.0 is confirmed to work perfectly on the device.",
      "After updating the firmware on the SOHO MK3 from version 8.0.2 to 8.1.0, users are experiencing issues where the router crashes during upload speed tests, particularly when sustained upload speeds exceed 55 Mbps. This problem occurs consistently during speed tests and affects teleworking capabilities. The user has not enabled any new features from the update, and the firmware version still displays as 8.0.2 after rebooting.",
      "After updating the firmware on the SOHO MK3 from version 8.0.2 to 8.1.0, the device continues to display version 8.0.2 after rebooting. Additionally, users report that running browser speed tests causes the SOHO MK3 to crash during the upload phase, particularly when sustained upload speeds exceed 55 Mbps. The device becomes unresponsive and requires a manual reboot to recover.",
      "After attempting to upgrade the SOHO MK3 to firmware 8.1.0 from 8.0.2, users may encounter issues where the device still shows the previous firmware version after rebooting. Additionally, there are reports of receiving a 'not bootable' error when trying to upgrade to build 4941 of firmware 8.1, indicating potential compatibility or installation issues with the firmware upgrade process for the SOHO MK3.",
      "When upgrading the firmware of the SOHO MK3 from version 8.0.2 to 8.1.0, a special firmware may be required if the upgrade does not reflect after rebooting. This issue has been noted specifically for the SOHO MK3 model and does not occur with the B30 model.",
      "The firmware update from 8.0.2 to 8.1.0 on Surf SOHO Mk3 routers may fail when the devices are managed through InControl, as evidenced by multiple users experiencing issues with the update process. In contrast, a Surf SOHO Mk3 that was not connected to InControl successfully updated to firmware 8.1.0 on the first attempt. Users are considering whether to use a special firmware version or inquire about newer firmware options to resolve the update failures.",
      "To unlock a Peplink Balance 710 running firmware version 5.2.9, it is necessary to create an account on incontrol2.peplink.com and add the device's serial numbers there. This process will provide the correct unlock key needed for validation.",
      "The Peplink Balance 710 devices are showing no model information and a firmware version of 5.2.9, along with a serial number of 0000-0000-0000, indicating a potential corruption issue. The unlock key validation is failing due to an invalid serial number, suggesting that the devices may need to be replaced.",
      "To effectively block Windows 10 updates on a Pepwave router with firmware 8.0, one can use the Content Blocking feature to block specific domains such as update.microsoft.com, mp.microsoft.com, windowsupdate.com, settings-win.data.microsoft.com, telemetry.microsoft.com, and browser.events.data.msn.com. If Content Blocking is not sufficient, additional Local DNS records can be utilized to enhance the blocking capabilities."

    "query": "A technician is attempting to upgrade the firmware of a Pepwave SOHO MK3 from version 8.0.2 to 8.1.0 but finds that after rebooting, the router still displays 8.0.2, and sometimes crashes during upload speed tests exceeding 55 Mbps. What troubleshooting steps and solutions should the technician consider, and what factors may cause these issues?",
    "answer": "The SOHO MK3 often fails to reflect a firmware upgrade from 8.0.2 to 8.1.0 after rebooting, even though the upgrade process appears to complete. This issue is specific to the SOHO MK3 and does not occur with devices like the B30. Users have reported that when the firmware upgrade appears successful, the device still shows 8.0.2 after reboot, and running upload speed tests can cause the router to crash, especially when sustained upload speeds exceed 55 Mbps. The crash and the upgrade not reflecting may be related to configuration issues, management through InControl, or the need for special firmware. Troubleshooting steps include downloading the current configuration, restoring the router to factory defaults, upgrading the firmware again, and then restoring the configuration if the upgrade is successful. If managed by InControl, disconnecting from InControl or using a special firmware version may resolve the issue. A 'not bootable' error during upgrade attempts may indicate a compatibility or installation problem, and checking for newer or special firmware builds is advised.",
