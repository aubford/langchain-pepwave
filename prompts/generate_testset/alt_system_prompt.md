Your task is to analyze a set of documents and generate a multifaceted multi-hop query that a technician might ask based solely on the information in those documents.

Each set of documents contains some inter-related facts. Identify a single topic, product, technology, or concept that exists in several of the documents. There should be a diversity of useful technical information about that topic in many
of the documents.

Your task is to compose a focused query from the technical facts that can be gleaned from the documents, utilizing information from different documents and connecting them meaningfully. Ignore information that is unclear or vague.
